Anti-cancer chemotherapy often induces peripheral neuropathy and consequent cognitive and quality of life impairment. Guidelines recommend antiepileptics or antidepressants but their efficacy is limited.Dextromethorphan, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has shown its efficacy in painful diabetic neuropathy and in post-operative pain but has not been studied in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. This clinical trial evaluates the effect of dextromethorphan on pain, cognition and quality of life in patients who suffer from neuropathic pain induced by chemotherapy for breast cancer. It also assesses the impact of dextromethorphan genetic polymorphism on analgesia.	N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	peripheral
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affects patient outcomes and satisfaction. New research has centered on evaluation of post-discharge and opioid-related nausea and vomiting. Mechanical and drug effects stimulate the release of central nervous system neurotransmitters acting at receptors in the vomiting center, area postrema, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Brain surgery has allowed insight into specific central emetogenic areas. Stimuli from peripheral organs act through afferent vagus neurons and a parasympathetic response causing nausea and vomiting. Opioids stimulate mu receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and cholinergic receptors in the vestibular system. Opioids also affect gastrointestinal (GI) tract mechanics by decreasing gastric emptying, intestinal motility, GI peristalsis, and secretions. Regional blocks and non-opioid multimodal analgesia help to decrease nausea and vomiting. Patient, surgery, and anesthesia factors contribute to risk and degree of PONV experienced. Pharmacogenetics plays a role in gene typing as antiemetic medication metabolism results in varying drug effectiveness. Risk scoring systems are available. Individualized multimodal plans can be designed as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol.	anesthesia	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	vestibular
Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) has a high mortality rate. Despite various therapeutic targets, non-responsiveness to drugs remains a prevalent issue. Pharmacogenomics assesses the way an individual's genetic attributes affect their likely response to drug therapy. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms play a crucial role in determining these outcomes. This review offers an overview of single-nucleotide polymorphisms investigated in clinical studies and their associations with drug response/nonresponse in the treatment of CAD. A total of 104 studies of whole sets of chromosomes and several genes were explored. A total of 161 polymorphisms exhibited associations with drug response/nonresponse in CAD across diverse ethnic populations. This pool can serve as a pharmacogenomic biomarker for predicting response to drug therapy in patients with CAD.	chromosomes	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	Coronary artery
Genotyping of gDNA rs12041331 (PEAR1), rs6065 (GP1BA), and rs730012 (LTC4S) can provide systematic guidance on the use of aspirin. However, an accurate, reliable and economical approach to simultaneous detection of the above single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is not reported. Herein, we designed and substantiated an allele-specific (AS) forward primer-superposed amplification analysis for measurement of the SNPs in PEAR1, GP1BA and LTC4S genes, in which the values of ∆Cq (differences in threshold cycles between the wild-type forward primer-based assay and the mutated-type forward primer-based assay) were employed to decide genotype. Mismatch AS forward primers were screened with the singleplex amplification analysis. Moreover, Cq extension optimized by AS forward primer superposition was observed in the selected forward primer-based triplex analysis. Further, robustness assessment of the triplex analysis showed the amplification efficiency ranging from 0.9 to 1.1. Precision test demonstrated the coefficient of variation of less than 2%. And the detective results of 189 DNA samples was completely concordant with that of commercial Sanger sequencing. In summary, we developed a simple, accurate and economical approach to genotyping of rs12041331 (PEAR1), rs6065 (GP1BA) and rs730012 (LTC4S) to provide a valuable pharmacogenomics tool for guidance of aspirin delivery.

Current anti-thrombotic therapies such as warfarin and clopidogrel are effective in inhibiting cardiovascular events; however, there is great inter-individual variability in response to these medications. In recent years, it has been recognized that genetic factors play a significant role in drug response, and, subsequently, common variants in genes responsible for metabolism and drug action have been identified. These discoveries along with new diagnostic targets and therapeutic strategies hold promise for more effective individualized anti-coagulation and anti-platelet therapy.

Allogenic solid organ transplantation has become the routine procedure in patients with end stage organ disease. Although the transplanted organ compensates deficient body functions, its allogenic nature requires institution of immune tolerance, nowadays provided by immunosuppressive drug administration. Both the safety and efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment depend on many factors, and maintaining levels of immunosuppressants within therapeutic range is the essential target for success in graft function preservation. It is obvious that drug and metabolite concentrations depend on efficiency of individual patient metabolism. Recently, many studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between genetic factors, drug pharmacokinetics and therapy outcome, and interindividual variability apparently can be explained, at least in part, by genetically determined polymorphisms of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, transport proteins and also in some cases, drug targets. This review presents the recent state of knowledge in the field of pharmacogenetics related to solid organ transplantation.	organ	ORGAN	graft

To document determinants of O-demethylation in critically ill (pre)term neonates and infants, tramadol (M) and O-demethyl tramadol (M1) concentrations were quantified in eighty-six 24 h urine collections and 168 plasma samples. A significant correlation of urine log M/M1 (0.98, SD 0.66) and plasma log M/M1 (0.78, SD 0.45) with postmenstrual age (PMA) (r = -0.69 and -0.65) was observed. One-way analysis of variance documented a significant decrease in urine log and plasma log M/M1 with increasing CYP2D6 activity score (F value 11.6 and 22.55). PMA and CYP2D6 activity score determined the urine and plasma log M/M1 (R 0.59 and 0.64) in a forward multiple regression model. We therefore conclude that PMA and CYP2D6 polymorphisms determined O-demethylation activity in (pre)term neonates and young infants, illustrating the impact of pharmacogenetics on drug metabolism in neonates although a relevant part of the interindividual varaibility remained unexplained. Besides compound-specific relevance, CYP2D6 iso-enzyme specific data on in vivo ontogeny of O-demethylation can contribute to safer and more effective administration of drugs metabolized by the same route in this population.	plasma	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	urine

Warfarin is a cornerstone of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Anticoagulation with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation is over twice as effective in secondary prevention of stroke as any other tested alternatives, including all other antithrombotic drugs or surgical interventions. General belief is that warfarin is capable of preventing 20 ischemic strokes for every hemorrhagic one it causes. However, warfarin is one of the most feared agents as a result of its woeful safety profile and difficulties in maintaining the proper daily dose. Recent research in pharmacogenetics predominantly focused on elucidating the influence of individual genetic predispositions to administered warfarin. Although the incorporation of genotype information improves the accuracy of adequate dose prediction, an improvement in anticoagulation control or a reduction in hemorrhagic complications has not been yet convincingly demonstrated. It is clear that identifying an individual patient's risk for hemorrhage on warfarin will require more broad clinical and genetic studies. Future research focused on patients with stroke should concentrate on defining the possible differences, especially focusing on predicting bleeding events in general and intracranial hemorrhages in particular. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing evidence about pharmacogenetics of warfarin in general, especially focusing on stroke prevention.	intracranial	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral
The pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus can be partly explained by CYP3A5 activity. Our objective was to evaluate a tacrolimus sparing policy on renal graft outcome according to <i>CYP3A5</i> 6986A>G genetic polymorphism. This retrospective study included 1114 recipients with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Genotyping of the 6986A>G allelic variant corresponding to <i>CYP3A5*3</i> was systematically performed. One year after transplantation, tacrolimus blood trough concentration (C0) target range was 5-7 ng/mL. However, daily dose was capped to 0.10 mg/kg/day regardless of the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype. A total 208 <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients were included. Despite a higher daily dose, <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients exhibited lower C0 during follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of <i>CYP3A5*1</i>/- genotype (HR = 0.70, 0.46-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.10) on patient-graft survival. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline was significantly lower for the <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> genotype did not significantly impact the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (HR = 1.01, 0.68-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.97) despite significantly lower C0. Based on our experience, a strategy of tacrolimus capping is associated with a better GFR evolution in <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients without any significant increase of BPAR incidence. Our study raised some issues about specific therapeutic tacrolimus C0 targets for <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients and suggests to set up randomized control studies in this specific population.

Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active drug moiety of mycophenolate, is a potent immunosuppressant agent, which is increasingly being used in the treatment of patients with various autoimmune diseases. An understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate in this population should assist the clinician with rational dosage decisions. This review aims to provide an overview of the published literature on the clinical pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate in autoimmune disease and a briefer summary of current pharmacodynamic knowledge, and to identify areas of potential future research in this field. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE databases as well as bibliographies of relevant articles and 'on-line early' pages of key journals. Twenty-six pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies of mycophenolate in people with autoimmune disease were identified and appraised. Twenty-two of these studies used non-compartmental analysis techniques and four used population modelling methods to estimate mycophenolate pharmacokinetic parameters. Seven studies linked mycophenolate exposure to treatment outcomes. Only four studies measured free (unbound) as well as total mycophenolate exposure and only two studies characterised MPA disposition following enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) administration. Across all studies MPA displayed erratic and complex pharmacokinetics with substantial between-subject variability. Based on total drug measurement, the dose-normalised MPA area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 12 h post-dose (AUC12) varied at least five- to ten-fold between subjects. Typical values for apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of MPA during nonlinear mixed-effects modelling ranged from 8.3 to 25.3 L/h. Patient renal function, serum albumin levels, sex, ethnicity, food intake, concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as antacids, metal-containing medications and proton pump inhibitors and polymorphisms in genes encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase were identified in some studies as having a significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate. Typical MPA CL/F values in autoimmune disease patients were generally slightly lower than values published previously in population pharmacokinetic studies involving renal allograft recipients, possibly because of usage of ciclosporin, poorer renal function or lower serum albumin levels in the renal transplant cohort. In a single crossover study involving ten subjects only, significantly higher MPA AUC12 and maximum MPA concentration (C max) and lower MPA CL/F were reported following EC-MPS administration compared to mycophenolate mofetil administration. MPA exposure correlated well with treatment efficacy in patients with autoimmune disease (response to treatment, active disease and disease markers); however the relationship between MPA exposure and adverse events (infectious episodes, haematological toxicity and gastrointestinal symptoms) was unclear. Further investigation is required in autoimmune diseases such as chronic plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis and following EC-MPS administration. The extent of within-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate is largely unknown and potential covariate influences need to be confirmed in studies with large subject numbers. A relationship between MPA and MPA metabolite exposure and toxicity needs to be established. The contribution of pharmacogenetics to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate warrants further investigation, as does the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring. Dosing to achieve a target MPA AUC12 >35 mg·h/L is likely to lead to better efficacy outcomes in patients with autoimmune disease (rather than just giving standard doses, which lead to a wide range of exposures). However, the relationship between mycophenolate exposure and toxicity requires further investigation to determine the upper end of a target AUC range.	renal transplant	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral
