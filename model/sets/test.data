Acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH) is a serine protease involved in the recycling of amino acids from acylated peptides. Beyond that, APEH participates in the metabolism of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid; VPA) by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the VPA metabolite valproylglucuronide (VPA-G) to its aglycon. It has been shown that the inhibition of APEH by carbapenem antibiotics decreases therapeutic VPA levels by enhancing the urinary elimination of VPA in form of VPA-G. As various sequence variants of the APEH gene (which encodes the APEH protein) are listed in databases, but have not been functionally characterized yet, we assume, that some APEH sequence variants may have pharmacogenetic relevance due to their impaired cleavage of VPA-G. APEH sequence variants predicted to affect enzyme activity were selected from databases, and overexpressed in HEK293 cells (stable transfection), a cell line derived from human embryonic kidney cells. APEH activity in cell homogenates was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate N-acetyl-L-alanine-nitroanilide. APEH enzyme activity and protein expression of the sequence variants were compared with those of APEH with the reference sequence. Three out of five tested missense sequence variants resulted in a considerable decrease of enzyme activity assessed with the standard substrate N-acetyl-L-alanine-nitroanilide, suggesting an effect on pharmacokinetics of VPA. Our work underlines the need to consider the APEH genotype in investigations of altered VPA metabolism.	0	21	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	Acylpeptide hydrolase

Acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH) is a serine protease involved in the recycling of amino acids from acylated peptides. Beyond that, APEH participates in the metabolism of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid; VPA) by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the VPA metabolite valproylglucuronide (VPA-G) to its aglycon. It has been shown that the inhibition of APEH by carbapenem antibiotics decreases therapeutic VPA levels by enhancing the urinary elimination of VPA in form of VPA-G. As various sequence variants of the APEH gene (which encodes the APEH protein) are listed in databases, but have not been functionally characterized yet, we assume, that some APEH sequence variants may have pharmacogenetic relevance due to their impaired cleavage of VPA-G. APEH sequence variants predicted to affect enzyme activity were selected from databases, and overexpressed in HEK293 cells (stable transfection), a cell line derived from human embryonic kidney cells. APEH activity in cell homogenates was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate N-acetyl-L-alanine-nitroanilide.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the major pediatric cancer in developed countries. Although treatment outcome has improved owing to advances in chemotherapy, there is still a group of patients for which therapy fails while some patients experience severe toxicity. In the last few years, several pharmacogenetic studies have been performed to search for markers of outcome and toxicity in pediatric ALL. However, to date, TPMT is the only pharmacogenetic marker in ALL with clinical guidelines for drug dosing. In this article, we will provide an overview of the most important findings carried out in pharmacogenetics for pediatric ALL, such as the interest drawn by methotrexate transporters in the context of methotrexate treatment. Even if most of the studies are centered on coding genes, we will also point to new approaches focusing on noncoding regions and epigenetic variation that could be interesting for consideration in the near future.	428	432	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	TPMT
Anti-cancer chemotherapy often induces peripheral neuropathy and consequent cognitive and quality of life impairment. Guidelines recommend antiepileptics or antidepressants but their efficacy is limited.Dextromethorphan, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has shown its efficacy in painful diabetic neuropathy and in post-operative pain but has not been studied in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. This clinical trial evaluates the effect of dextromethorphan on pain, cognition and quality of life in patients who suffer from neuropathic pain induced by chemotherapy for breast cancer. It also assesses the impact of dextromethorphan genetic polymorphism on analgesia.	223	252	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
Apixaban and rivaroxaban are the two most prescribed direct factor Xa inhibitors. With the increased use of DOACs in real-world settings, safety and efficacy concerns have emerged, particularly regarding their concomitant use with other drugs. Increasing evidence highlights drug−drug interactions with CYP3A/P-gp modulators leading to adverse events. However, current recommendations for dose adjustment do not consider CYP3A/P-gp genotype and phenotype. We aimed to determine their impact on apixaban and rivaroxaban blood exposure. Three-hundred hospitalized patients were included. CYP3A and P-gp phenotypic activities were assessed by the metabolic ratio of midazolam and AUC0−6h of fexofenadine, respectively. Relevant CYP3A and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms were also tested. Capillary blood samples collected at four time-points after apixaban or rivaroxaban administration allowed the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. According to the developed multivariable linear regression models, P-gp activity (p < 0.001) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) (p = 0.01) significantly affected apixaban AUC0−6h. P-gp activity (p < 0.001) also significantly impacted rivaroxaban AUC0−6h. The phenotypic switch (from normal to poor metabolizer) of P-gp led to an increase of apixaban and rivaroxaban AUC0−6h by 16% and 25%, respectively, equivalent to a decrease of 38 mL/min in CrCl according to the apixaban model. CYP3A phenotype and tested SNPs of CYP3A/P-gp had no significant impact. In conclusion, P-gp phenotypic activity, rather than known CYP3A/P-gp polymorphisms, could be relevant for dose adjustment.	421	431	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	CYP3A/P-gp

Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors tonically inhibit colonic motility and the alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, given intravenously, increased colonic tone in humans. However, the effect of yohimbine on colonic transit in humans is unknown. In this study, 30 healthy volunteers were randomized to yohimbine 16.2 mg p.o. t.i.d. or identical placebo for 7 days. We evaluated gastric emptying, small intestinal, and colonic transit by scinitigraphy, bowel habits, haemodynamics and plasma catecholamines. As cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize yohimbine, P450 genotypes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) were determined in 25 of 30 subjects who consented to genetic studies. The relationship between drug metabolizer status predicted by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and effects of yohmibine were assessed. Compared to placebo, yohimbine increased (P < or = 0.02) diastolic blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline concentrations and maximum tolerated volume during the satiation test [yohimbine (1241 +/- 88, mean +/- SEM) vs placebo (1015 +/- 87), P = 0.054]. However, yohimbine did not affect gastrointestinal transit. Based on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 alleles, seven and 18 subjects were, respectively, extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of yohimbine. Compared to EM, PM of yohimbine had a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline (P = 0.1 for PM vs EM), lower maximum tolerated volumes (1120 +/- 95 vs 1484 + 131 mL, P = 0.02), and faster colonic transit (i.e. GC(24) was 3.0 +/- 0.4 vs 2.1 +/- 0.5, P = 0.1). These data suggest that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genotypes which determine the metabolism of yohimbine may influence its sympathetic and gastrointestinal effects.	120	133	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenously
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) models can serve as a powerful framework for predicting the influence as well as the interaction of formulation, genetic polymorphism and co-medication on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug substances. In this study, flurbiprofen, a potent non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, was chosen as a model drug. Flurbiprofen has absolute bioavailability of ~95% and linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 50-300 mg. Its absorption is considered variable and complex, often associated with double peak phenomena, and its pharmacokinetics are characterized by high inter-subject variability, mainly due to its metabolism by the polymorphic CYP2C9 (fmCYP2C9 ≥ 0.71). In this study, by leveraging <i>in vitro, in silico</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data, an integrated PBPK/PD model with mechanistic absorption was developed and evaluated against clinical data from PK, PD, drug-drug and gene-drug interaction studies. The PBPK model successfully predicted (within 2-fold) 36 out of 38 observed concentration-time profiles of flurbiprofen as well as the CYP2C9 genetic effects after administration of different intravenous and oral dosage forms over a dose range of 40-300 mg in both Caucasian and Chinese healthy volunteers. All model predictions for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub> and CL/F were within two-fold of their respective mean or geometric mean values, while 90% of the predictions of C<sub>max</sub>, 81% of the predictions of AUC<sub>inf</sub> and 74% of the predictions of Cl/F were within 1.25 fold. In addition, the drug-drug and drug-gene interactions were predicted within 1.5-fold of the observed interaction ratios (AUC, C<sub>max</sub> ratios). The validated PBPK model was further expanded by linking it to an inhibitory <i>E<sub>max</sub></i> model describing the analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen and applying it to explore the effect of formulation and genetic polymorphisms on the onset and duration of pain relief. This comprehensive PBPK/PD analysis, along with a detailed translational biopharmaceutic framework including appropriately designed biorelevant <i>in vitro</i> experiments and <i>in vitro-in vivo</i> extrapolation, provided mechanistic insight on the impact of formulation and genetic variations, two major determinants of the population variability, on the PK/PD of flurbiprofen. Clinically relevant specifications and potential dose adjustments were also proposed. Overall, the present work highlights the value of a translational PBPK/PD approach, tailored to target populations and genotypes, as an approach towards achieving personalized medicine.	1178	1189	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous
RNA interference (RNAi) is a process for regulating the gene expression in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silence target genes. siRNA-based therapy as a new molecular treatment approach, offers therapeutic prospects for many common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Nevertheless, the efficacy of siRNA delivery has, so far, remained a challenging issue. This is due to their easy degradation through the circulation system and the difficulties in the intracellular delivery to specific tissues where they silence the target genes. There have been many efforts to develop suitable, safe and effective siRNA delivery systems in the past decades. These efforts specifically aimed to protect siRNA from serum nucleases and deliver it to an intracellular region in the desired target cells. In this context, one of the new and popular approaches is nanovehicle-mediated siRNA delivery systems.	478	491	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular

One of the unsolved mysteries of medicine is how do volatile anesthetics (VAs) cause a patient to reversibly lose consciousness. In addition, identifying mechanisms for the collateral effects of VAs, including anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (AiN) and anesthetic preconditioning (AP), has proven challenging. Multiple classes of molecules (lipids, proteins, and water) have been considered as potential VA targets, but recently proteins have received the most attention. Studies targeting neuronal receptors or ion channels had limited success in identifying the critical targets of VAs mediating either the phenotype of "anesthesia" or their collateral effects. Recent studies in both nematodes and fruit flies may provide a paradigm shift by suggesting that mitochondria may harbor the upstream molecular switch activating both primary and collateral effects. The disruption of a specific step of electron transfer within the mitochondrion causes hypersensitivity to VAs, from nematodes to <i>Drosophila</i> and to humans, while also modulating the sensitivity to collateral effects. The downstream effects from mitochondrial inhibition are potentially legion, but inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter cycling appears to be specifically sensitive to the mitochondrial effects. These findings are perhaps of even broader interest since two recent reports indicate that mitochondrial damage may well underlie neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of VAs in the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, important to understand how anesthetics interact with mitochondria to affect CNS function, not just for the desired facets of general anesthesia but also for significant collateral effects, both harmful and beneficial. A tantalizing possibility exists that both the primary (anesthesia) and secondary (AiN, AP) mechanisms may at least partially overlap in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).	210	228	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	anesthetic-induced

The cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme involved in the clearance of many drugs. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 contribute to the large inter-individual variability in drug metabolism and could affect metabolic phenotyping of CYP2D6 probe substances such as dextromethorphan (DXM). To study this question, we (i) established an extensive pharmacokinetics dataset for DXM; and (ii) developed and validated a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of DXM and its metabolites dextrorphan (DXO) and dextrorphan O-glucuronide (DXO-Glu) based on the data. Drug-gene interactions (DGI) were introduced by accounting for changes in CYP2D6 enzyme kinetics depending on activity score (AS), which in combination with AS for individual polymorphisms allowed us to model CYP2D6 gene variants. Variability in CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 activity was modeled based on <i>in vitro</i> data from human liver microsomes. Model predictions are in very good agreement with pharmacokinetics data for CYP2D6 polymorphisms, CYP2D6 activity as described by the AS system, and CYP2D6 metabolic phenotypes (UM, EM, IM, PM). The model was applied to investigate the genotype-phenotype association and the role of CYP2D6 polymorphisms for metabolic phenotyping using the urinary cumulative metabolic ratio (UCMR), DXM/(DXO + DXO-Glu). The effect of parameters on UCMR was studied <i>via</i> sensitivity analysis. Model predictions indicate very good robustness against the intervention protocol (i.e. application form, dosing amount, dissolution rate, and sampling time) and good robustness against physiological variation. The model is capable of estimating the UCMR dispersion within and across populations depending on activity scores. Moreover, the distribution of UCMR and the risk of genotype-phenotype mismatch could be estimated for populations with known CYP2D6 genotype frequencies. The model can be applied for individual prediction of UCMR and metabolic phenotype based on CYP2D6 genotype. Both, model and database are freely available for reuse.	1672	1676	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	UCMR
Mithramycin demonstrates preclinical anticancer activity, but its therapeutic dose is limited by the development of hepatotoxicity that remains poorly characterized. A pharmacogenomics characterization of mithramycin-induced transaminitis revealed that hepatotoxicity is associated with germline variants in genes involved in bile disposition: <i>ABCB4</i> (multidrug resistance 3) rs2302387 and <i>ABCB11</i> [bile salt export pump (BSEP)] rs4668115 reduce transporter expression (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and were associated with ≥grade 3 transaminitis developing 24 hours after the third infusion of mithramycin (25 mcg/kg, 6 hours/infusion, every day ×7, every 28 days; <i>P</i> < 0.0040). A similar relationship was observed in a pediatric cohort. We therefore undertook to characterize the mechanism of mithramycin-induced acute transaminitis. As mithramycin affects cellular response to bile acid treatment by altering the expression of multiple bile transporters (e.g., ABCB4, ABCB11, sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, organic solute transporter <i>α</i>/<i>β</i>) in several cell lines [Huh7, HepaRG, HepaRG BSEP (-/-)] and primary human hepatocytes, we hypothesized that mithramycin inhibited bile-mediated activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR was downregulated in all hepatocyte cell lines and primary human hepatocytes (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and mithramycin inhibited chenodeoxycholic acid- and GW4046-induced FXR-galactose-induced gene 4 luciferase reporter activity (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Mithramycin promoted glycochenodeoxycholic acid-induced cytotoxicity in <i>ABCB11</i> (-<i>/</i>-) cells and increased the overall intracellular concentration of bile acids in primary human hepatocytes grown in sandwich culture (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Mithramycin is a FXR expression and FXR transactivation inhibitor that inhibits bile flow and potentiates bile-induced cellular toxicity, particularly in cells with low ABCB11 function. These results suggest that mithramycin causes hepatotoxicity through derangement of bile acid disposition; results also suggest that pharmacogenomic markers may be useful to identify patients who may tolerate higher mithramycin doses. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The present study characterizes a novel mechanism of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in which mithramycin not only alters farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner gene expression but also inhibits bile acid binding to FXR, resulting in deregulation of cellular bile homeostasis. Two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms in bile flow transporters are associated with mithramycin-induced liver function test elevations, and the present results are the rationale for a genotype-directed clinical trial using mithramycin in patients with thoracic malignancies.	1648	1661	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affects patient outcomes and satisfaction. New research has centered on evaluation of post-discharge and opioid-related nausea and vomiting. Mechanical and drug effects stimulate the release of central nervous system neurotransmitters acting at receptors in the vomiting center, area postrema, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Brain surgery has allowed insight into specific central emetogenic areas. Stimuli from peripheral organs act through afferent vagus neurons and a parasympathetic response causing nausea and vomiting. Opioids stimulate mu receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and cholinergic receptors in the vestibular system. Opioids also affect gastrointestinal (GI) tract mechanics by decreasing gastric emptying, intestinal motility, GI peristalsis, and secretions. Regional blocks and non-opioid multimodal analgesia help to decrease nausea and vomiting. Patient, surgery, and anesthesia factors contribute to risk and degree of PONV experienced. Pharmacogenetics plays a role in gene typing as antiemetic medication metabolism results in varying drug effectiveness. Risk scoring systems are available. Individualized multimodal plans can be designed as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol.	942	952	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	anesthesia
Nephrotoxicity is a dose limiting side effect associated with the use of cisplatin in the treatment of solid tumors. The degree of nephrotoxicity is dictated by the selective accumulation of cisplatin in renal tubule cells due to: (1) uptake by organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and copper transporter 1 (CTR1); (2) metabolism by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and γ-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1); and (3) efflux by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1). The purpose of this study was to determine the significance of single nucleotide polymorphisms that regulate the expression and function of transporters and metabolism genes implicated in development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cisplatin treated patients. Changes in the kidney function were assessed using novel urinary protein biomarkers and traditional markers. Genotyping was conducted by the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System using a custom open array chip with metabolism, transport, and transcription factor polymorphisms of interest to cisplatin disposition and toxicity. Traditional and novel biomarker assays for kidney toxicity were assessed for differences according to genotype by ANOVA. Allele and genotype frequencies were determined based on Caucasian population frequencies. The polymorphisms rs596881 (<i>SLC22A2</i>/OCT2), and rs12686377 and rs7851395 (<i>SLC31A1</i>/CTR1) were associated with renoprotection and maintenance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Polymorphisms in <i>SLC22A2</i>/OCT2, <i>SLC31A1</i>/CTRI, <i>SLC47A1</i>/MATE1, <i>ABCC2</i>/MRP2, and <i>GSTP1</i> were significantly associated with increases in the urinary excretion of novel AKI biomarkers: KIM-1, TFF3, MCP1, NGAL, clusterin, cystatin C, and calbindin. Knowledge concerning which genotypes in drug transporters are associated with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity may help to identify at-risk patients and initiate strategies, such as using lower or fractionated cisplatin doses or avoiding cisplatin altogether, in order to prevent AKI.	1696	1703	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	urinary
The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of CYP2D6 activity on the efficacy and safety of mirtazapine in patients with depressive disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorder who received mirtazapine. The study included 109 Russian patients who received mirtazapine at a dose of 30.0 [15.0; 45.0] mg per day. Genotyping of <i>CYP2D6*4</i> (<i>1846G > A</i>, <i>rs3892097</i>) was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction with allele-specific hybridization. The activity of CYP2D6 was evaluated by determining the concentration of endogenous substrate of the enzyme and its urinary metabolite - pinoline to 6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline ratio, using high-performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. The statistically significant differences between the scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) in patients with different genotypes were revealed by day 16: (<i>GG</i>) 5.0 [3.0; 6.0], (<i>GA</i>) 1.5 [1.0; 3.2] (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and for the The UKU Side Effects Rating Scale (UKU): (<i>GG</i>) 6.0 [6.0; 7.0], (<i>GA</i>) 8.5 [8.0; 10.0] (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The calculation of correlation coefficients between the differences in scale scores and metabolic rate showed the presence of statistically significant weak inverse correlation with the efficacy indicator evaluated by HAMD (<i>r</i> = -0.278, <i>p</i> < 0.05), but not by UKU (<i>r</i> = 0.274, <i>p</i> > 0.05). This study demonstrated that an increased CYP2D6 activity reduces the efficacy of treatment with mirtazapine.	600	607	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	urinary
Hypertension is a complex, multifactorial disease; genetic factors represent one third to half of the inter-individual variability of blood pressure values. Among the causes of secondary hypertension are a group of disorders with a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Recent advances in molecular biology have revealed the pathogenesis of hypertension in many of these conditions. Remarkably, the mechanism in every case has proved to be upregulation of sodium Na reabsorption in the distal nephron, with accompanying expansion of extracellular volume. On the contrary in the essential hypertension the underlying pathogenetic mechanism is more complex because of interplay between several 'risk' genes and environmental factors. It is assumed that blood pressure is under the control of a large number of genes each of which has only relatively mild effects. It has therefore been difficult to discover the genes that contribute to blood pressure variation using traditional approaches including candidate gene studies and linkage studies. Recent development of genotyping technology made large scale genome-wide association studies possible. This approach and the study of monogenic forms of hypertension has led to the discovery of novel and robust candidate genes for human essential hypertension, many of which require functional analysis in experimental models. This review summarizes the current findings for candidate genes associated with blood pressure and focuses on recent advances and future potential of pharmacogenetics of hypertension, with the intent to clarify what amount of these investments in basic science research will be delivered into benefits to patients.	526	539	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	extracellular

Data variability is a costly complication of biomedical experimentation because the same experiment must be repeated a sufficient number of times so that the sample mean becomes a credible representation of the entire population. Since sampling is ideally done randomly in populations normalized for environmental and genetic backgrounds, data variability is viewed as a purely statistical issue reflecting the distribution in the population and captured as the standard deviation of the sampled data. The factors contributing to data variability are not analyzed by statistical methods; for want of a better explanation, data scatter is simply attributed to random noise and/or methodological limitations. In this commentary, evidence is discussed that documents an important role of interindividual biological diversity as a cause for data variability based on studies in which repeated sampling in the same individual permitted statistical comparisons between individuals in the same sample. Significant differences were found for proximal fluid reabsorption and plasma renin concentration between sample means of individuals of the same population. Furthermore, arterial blood pressure varied significantly between individual mice independently of strain and sex. Recognition of the extent of interindividual variability has important implications for data reproducibility, data collection, and data presentation in physiological research. Such nonrandom data variability may have different causes, but DNA modifications by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms could generate phenotype variants without being associated with disease symptoms. Exploration of the heritability of phenotypical diversity in physiology may be defined as "physiogenetics," and it would thus be the physiological corollary of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics.	1166	1196	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	arterial blood pressure varied
Multiple biological processes throughout development require intracellular vesicular trafficking, where the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein (SNAP) receptors) complex plays a major role. The core proteins forming the SNARE complex are SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein 25), VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein) and Syntaxins, besides its regulatory proteins, such as Synaptotagmin. Genes encoding these proteins (SNAP25, VAMP1, VAMP2, STX1A, SYT1 and SYT2) have been studied in relation to psychiatric disorders susceptibility. Here, we review physiological aspects of SNARE complex and genetic association results reported for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, both in children and adults, autism spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Moreover, we included findings from expression, pharmacogenetics and animal model studies regarding these clinical phenotypes. The overall scenario depicted here suggests that the SNARE complex may exert distinct roles throughout development, with age-specific effects of genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Such perspective should be considered in future studies regarding SNARE complex genes.	61	84	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular vesicular
Persons with type 2 diabetes born in the regions of famine exposures have disproportionally elevated risk of vision-threatening proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in adulthood. However, the underlying mechanisms are not known. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the plausible molecular factors underlying progression to PDR. To study the association of genetic variants with PDR under the intrauterine famine exposure, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were previously reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes, glucose, and pharmacogenetics. Analyses were performed in the population from northern Ukraine with a history of exposure to the Great Ukrainian Holodomor famine [the Diagnostic Optimization and Treatment of Diabetes and its Complications in the Chernihiv Region (DOLCE study), <i>n</i> = 3,583]. A validation of the top genetic findings was performed in the Hong Kong diabetes registry (HKDR, <i>n</i> = 730) with a history of famine as a consequence of the Japanese invasion during WWII. In DOLCE, the genetic risk for PDR was elevated for the variants in <i>ADRA2A</i>, <i>PCSK</i>9, and <i>CYP2C19*2</i> loci, but reduced at <i>PROX1</i> locus. The association of <i>ADRA2A</i> loci with the risk of advanced diabetic retinopathy in famine-exposed group was further replicated in HKDR. The exposure of embryonic retinal cells to starvation for glucose, mimicking the perinatal exposure to famine, resulted in sustained increased expression of <i>Adra2a</i> and <i>Pcsk9</i>, but decreased <i>Prox1</i>. The exposure to starvation exhibited a lasting inhibitory effects on neurite outgrowth, as determined by neurite length. In conclusion, a consistent genetic findings on the famine-linked risk of <i>ADRA2A</i> with PDR indicate that the nerves may likely to be responsible for communicating the effects of perinatal exposure to famine on the elevated risk of advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy in adults. These results suggest the possibility of utilizing neuroprotective drugs for the prevention and treatment of PDR.	406	418	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intrauterine
Voriconazole (VRC) overdoses are frequent and expose patients at high risk of adverse effects. This case-control study performed in hematological patients who benefited from VRC therapeutic drug monitoring from January 2012 to December 2015 aimed to identify risk factors of VRC overdose. Pharmacogenetic, biological, and demographic parameters at the time of VRC trough concentration (C<sub>min</sub> ) were retrospectively collected from medical records. Cases (VRC overdose: defined by a VRC C<sub>min</sub> ≥ 4 mg/L; n = 31) were compared to controls (no VRC overdose: defined by VRC C<sub>min</sub> < 4 mg/L; n = 31) using nonparametric or chi-square tests followed by multivariable analysis. VRC overdoses were significantly associated with high CRP and bilirubin levels, intravenous administration, and age in univariable analysis. In contrast, the proportion of CYP genotypes (CYP2C19, CYP3A4, or CYP3A5, considered alone or combined in a combined genetic score) were not significantly different between patients who experienced a VRC overdose and those who did not. In multivariable analysis, the class of CRP level (defined by median CRP levels of 96 mg/L) was the sole independent risk factor of VRC overdose (P < 0.01). Patients with CRP levels > 96 mg/L) had a 27-fold (IC 95%: [6-106]) higher risk of VRC overdose than patients with CRP levels ≤ 96 mg/L. This study demonstrates that inflammatory status, assessed by CRP levels, is the main risk factor of VRC overdose in French hematological patients, whereas pharmacogenetic determinants do not appear to be involved.	778	789	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous
The field of pharmacogenomics seeks to identify the impact of genetic variants on drug dosing, response, metabolism, and safety outcomes. The narrow therapeutic indices for anesthesia drugs, variability of patient responses to anesthesia, and the risks associated with surgery make anesthetics and the perioperative period prime targets for pharmacogenetic research. Anesthesia providers strive to optimize anesthesia delivery and patient outcomes and to specifically reduce anesthesia-related risks and negative outcomes. Despite pharmacogenomics emerging from the field of anesthesia, the most significant advances to date in the understanding and application of genetics to pharmacology have occurred outside of anesthesiology. This chapter provides an overview of genetic concepts fundamental to understanding the pharmacogenetics of anesthesia practice and presents the current state of the science with respect to the genetic influence on the response to volatile and intravenous anesthetic agents and opioid receptor agonists commonly used in anesthesia practice. In addition, the chapter delineates U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling tenets for pharmacogenetics, discusses clinical implications of pharmacogenomics for family members, and highlights the potential for future paradigm shifts in pharmacogenomics of anesthesia practice.	974	985	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous
Acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH) is a serine protease involved in the recycling of amino acids from acylated peptides. Beyond that, APEH participates in the metabolism of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid; VPA) by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the VPA metabolite valproylglucuronide (VPA-G) to its aglycon. It has been shown that the inhibition of APEH by carbapenem antibiotics decreases therapeutic VPA levels by enhancing the urinary elimination of VPA in form of VPA-G. As various sequence variants of the APEH gene (which encodes the APEH protein) are listed in databases, but have not been functionally characterized yet, we assume, that some APEH sequence variants may have pharmacogenetic relevance due to their impaired cleavage of VPA-G. APEH sequence variants predicted to affect enzyme activity were selected from databases, and overexpressed in HEK293 cells (stable transfection), a cell line derived from human embryonic kidney cells. APEH activity in cell homogenates was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate N-acetyl-L-alanine-nitroanilide. APEH enzyme activity and protein expression of the sequence variants were compared with those of APEH with the reference sequence. Three out of five tested missense sequence variants resulted in a considerable decrease of enzyme activity assessed with the standard substrate N-acetyl-L-alanine-nitroanilide, suggesting an effect on pharmacokinetics of VPA. Our work underlines the need to consider the APEH genotype in investigations of altered VPA metabolism.	880	892	CELL	HEK293 cells

The latest consensus has changed <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping among Chinese population, while its impact on metoprolol tolerance and adverse events in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases remains unclear. In this study, we prospectively included elderly patients who started metoprolol treatment for cardiovascular indications. According to the latest consensus on <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype-to-phenotype translation, the patients were categorized as normal, intermediate, or poor metabolizers (NMs, IMs, or PMs, respectively) by detecting the presence of the <i>CYP2D6*1</i>, <i>*2</i>, <i>*5</i>, <i>*10</i>, and <i>*14</i>. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between the <i>CYP2D6</i> phenotype and incidence of adverse events, which were assessed over a 12-week period. In this study, there were 651 (62.7%) NMs, 385 (37.1%) IMs, and 3 (0.3%) PMs. After 12 weeks of follow-up, compared with NMs, IMs had the lower maintenance dose [50.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day vs. 25.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day, <i>p</i> < 0.001] and lower weight-adjusted maintenance doses (0.52 ± 0.25 mg/day/kg vs. 0.42 ± 0.22 mg/day/kg, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and had higher incidence of postural hypotension (6.0% vs. 10.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.006), bradycardia (21.5% vs. 28.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.011), asystole (0.8% vs. 3.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and syncope (2.0% vs. 6.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.001). In logistic regression model, the overall incidence of adverse events was 1.37-fold larger in IMs than in NMs (odds ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.79, <i>p</i> = 0.021). We conclude that IMs have lower tolerance and higher incidence of metoprolol-related adverse events than NMs in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases. <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping is justifiable in elderly patients to minimize the risk of adverse events and ensure the benefits of metoprolol.	931	934	CELL	NMs

Immortalized human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) have been proven as a particularly useful, scalable and low-cost model in pharmacogenetics research, and are suitable for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of synergistic combination therapies. In this review, we cover the advantages of LCLs in synergy pharmacogenomics and consider recent studies providing initial evidence of the utility of LCLs in synergy research. We also discuss several opportunities for LCL-based systems to address gaps in the research through the expansion of testing regimens, assessment of new drug classes and higher-order combinations, and utilization of integrated omics technologies.	503	507	CELL	LCLs

RNA interference (RNAi) is a process for regulating the gene expression in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silence target genes. siRNA-based therapy as a new molecular treatment approach, offers therapeutic prospects for many common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Nevertheless, the efficacy of siRNA delivery has, so far, remained a challenging issue. This is due to their easy degradation through the circulation system and the difficulties in the intracellular delivery to specific tissues where they silence the target genes. There have been many efforts to develop suitable, safe and effective siRNA delivery systems in the past decades. These efforts specifically aimed to protect siRNA from serum nucleases and deliver it to an intracellular region in the desired target cells. In this context, one of the new and popular approaches is nanovehicle-mediated siRNA delivery systems.	806	811	CELL	cells
Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.	754	766	CELL	BTBR T+ tf/J
Genetic factors associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) have been widely studied over the last decade. We examined whether genetic variants previously associated with BMI in the general population are associated with cardiometabolic parameter worsening in the psychiatric population receiving psychotropic drugs, a high-risk group for metabolic disturbances. Classification And Regression Trees (CARTs) were used as a tool capable of describing hierarchical associations, to pinpoint genetic variants best predicting worsening of cardiometabolic parameters (i.e total, HDL and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and blood pressure) following prescription of psychotropic drugs inducing weight gain in a discovery sample of 357 Caucasian patients. Significant findings were tested for replication in a second Caucasian psychiatric sample (n=140). SH2B1 rs3888190C>A was significantly associated with LDL levels in the discovery and in the replication sample, with A-allele carriers having 0.2mmol/l (p=0.005) and 0.36mmol/l (p=0.007) higher LDL levels compared to others, respectively. G-allele carriers of RABEP1 rs1000940A>G had lower fasting glucose levels compared to others in both samples (-0.16mmol/l; p<0.001 and -0.77mmol/l; p=0.03 respectively). The present study is the first to observe such associations in human subjects, which may in part be explained by a high risk towards dyslipidemia and diabetes in psychiatric patients receiving psychotropic treatments compared to population-based individuals. These results may therefore give new insight into the etiology of LDL-cholesterol and glucose regulation in psychiatric patients under psychotropic drug therapy.	949	952	CELL	LDL

Variation in gene expression has been found to be important in disease susceptibility and pharmacogenomics. Local and distant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been identified via genome-wide association study (GWAS); yet the functional analysis of these variants has been challenging. The aim of this study was to unravel the functional consequence of a gene with a local SNP with evidence for local and distant regulatory roles in cellular sensitivity to cisplatin, one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs. To this end, we measured cellular susceptibility to cisplatin in 176 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from Yoruba individuals from Ibadan, Nigeria. The 276 cytotoxicity-associated SNPs at the suggestive threshold of P ≤ 0.0001 were significantly enriched for eQTLs. Of these SNPs, we found one intronic SNP, rs17115814, that had a significant relationship with the expression level of its host gene, PRPF39 (P= 0.0007), and a significant correlation with the expression of over 100 distant transcripts (P ≤ 0.0001). Successful knockdown of PRPF39 expression using siRNA resulted in a significant increase in cisplatin resistance. We then measured the expression of 61 downstream targets after PRPF39 knockdown and found 53 gene targets had significant (P ≤ 0.05) expression changes. Included in the list of genes that significantly changed after PRPF39 knockdown were MAP3K4 and TFPD2, two important signaling genes previously shown to be relevant in cisplatin response. Thus, modulation of a local target gene identified through a GWAS was followed by a downstream cascade of gene expression changes resulting in greater resistance to cisplatin.	447	455	CELL	cellular

Acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH) is a serine protease involved in the recycling of amino acids from acylated peptides. Beyond that, APEH participates in the metabolism of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid; VPA) by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the VPA metabolite valproylglucuronide (VPA-G) to its aglycon. It has been shown that the inhibition of APEH by carbapenem antibiotics decreases therapeutic VPA levels by enhancing the urinary elimination of VPA in form of VPA-G. As various sequence variants of the APEH gene (which encodes the APEH protein) are listed in databases, but have not been functionally characterized yet, we assume, that some APEH sequence variants may have pharmacogenetic relevance due to their impaired cleavage of VPA-G. APEH sequence variants predicted to affect enzyme activity were selected from databases, and overexpressed in HEK293 cells (stable transfection), a cell line derived from human embryonic kidney cells. APEH activity in cell homogenates was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate N-acetyl-L-alanine-nitroanilide. APEH enzyme activity and protein expression of the sequence variants were compared with those of APEH with the reference sequence. Three out of five tested missense sequence variants resulted in a considerable decrease of enzyme activity assessed with the standard substrate N-acetyl-L-alanine-nitroanilide, suggesting an effect on pharmacokinetics of VPA. Our work underlines the need to consider the APEH genotype in investigations of altered VPA metabolism.	941	969	ORGANISM	human embryonic kidney cells

The fluorinated analog of uracil 5-FU is an antimetabolite, active against a wide range of solid tumors. The main mechanism of action consists in interfering with DNA synthesis and mRNA translation. However, patients treated with 5-FU display several side effects, a result of its nonspecific cytotoxicity for tumor cells. Numerous modifications of the 5-FU structure have been performed in order to overcome these disadvantages.	208	216	ORGANISM	patients
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the major pediatric cancer in developed countries. Although treatment outcome has improved owing to advances in chemotherapy, there is still a group of patients for which therapy fails while some patients experience severe toxicity. In the last few years, several pharmacogenetic studies have been performed to search for markers of outcome and toxicity in pediatric ALL. However, to date, TPMT is the only pharmacogenetic marker in ALL with clinical guidelines for drug dosing. In this article, we will provide an overview of the most important findings carried out in pharmacogenetics for pediatric ALL, such as the interest drawn by methotrexate transporters in the context of methotrexate treatment. Even if most of the studies are centered on coding genes, we will also point to new approaches focusing on noncoding regions and epigenetic variation that could be interesting for consideration in the near future.	190	198	ORGANISM	patients

Anti-cancer chemotherapy often induces peripheral neuropathy and consequent cognitive and quality of life impairment. Guidelines recommend antiepileptics or antidepressants but their efficacy is limited.Dextromethorphan, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has shown its efficacy in painful diabetic neuropathy and in post-operative pain but has not been studied in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. This clinical trial evaluates the effect of dextromethorphan on pain, cognition and quality of life in patients who suffer from neuropathic pain induced by chemotherapy for breast cancer. It also assesses the impact of dextromethorphan genetic polymorphism on analgesia.	521	529	ORGANISM	patients
Apixaban and rivaroxaban are the two most prescribed direct factor Xa inhibitors. With the increased use of DOACs in real-world settings, safety and efficacy concerns have emerged, particularly regarding their concomitant use with other drugs. Increasing evidence highlights drug−drug interactions with CYP3A/P-gp modulators leading to adverse events. However, current recommendations for dose adjustment do not consider CYP3A/P-gp genotype and phenotype. We aimed to determine their impact on apixaban and rivaroxaban blood exposure. Three-hundred hospitalized patients were included. CYP3A and P-gp phenotypic activities were assessed by the metabolic ratio of midazolam and AUC0−6h of fexofenadine, respectively. Relevant CYP3A and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms were also tested. Capillary blood samples collected at four time-points after apixaban or rivaroxaban administration allowed the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. According to the developed multivariable linear regression models, P-gp activity (p < 0.001) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) (p = 0.01) significantly affected apixaban AUC0−6h. P-gp activity (p < 0.001) also significantly impacted rivaroxaban AUC0−6h. The phenotypic switch (from normal to poor metabolizer) of P-gp led to an increase of apixaban and rivaroxaban AUC0−6h by 16% and 25%, respectively, equivalent to a decrease of 38 mL/min in CrCl according to the apixaban model. CYP3A phenotype and tested SNPs of CYP3A/P-gp had no significant impact. In conclusion, P-gp phenotypic activity, rather than known CYP3A/P-gp polymorphisms, could be relevant for dose adjustment.	562	570	ORGANISM	patients
Understanding gene-environment interactions that may influence disease is the cornerstone of a personalized medicine approach built on diagnostics, risk assessment/risk modification, pharmacogenetics and biology. Although genetic and personalized medicine can influence clinical decision making, currently most genetic information is based on populations of European ancestry. Additional human genome research must include diverse populations in order to assess the impact DNA sequence variation and environmental influences have on human disease risk. Within this article, we present a brief overview of human genome variation and discuss how epigenomics may influence gene expression. Examples of gene-environment interactions are explored and linked to several health disparities and health outcomes among communities of color. With the Jackson Heart Study poised to take the next steps in examining genes and the environment in ways that other cohorts cannot, we will be closer to a more inclusive personalized medicine goal that transforms medicine from curative to preemptive for all.	388	393	ORGANISM	human

Recent advances utilizing pharmacogenomics has helped researchers to probe in to disease pathophysiology and physicians to detect and, diagnose the disease in patients. The understanding developed in the area primarily addresses the issue focusing on the nature and asks the question 'Why' some individuals respond to the standard medication regimen and others do not. The central idea that genomics play a vital part in how the healthcare providers: physician, pharmacist, and nurse provide treatment utilizing the best practices available for maximum benefits. Pharmacogenomics is the scientific basis which offers the fundamental understanding for diseases, based on which therapeutic approaches can be designed and delivered. The discovery that not all humans respond to the drug in the same way is a 'paradigm shift' in how current therapies are offered. The area of pharmacogenomics at its core is linked to the genetic basis for the disease and the response to treatment. Given that diabetes and obesity are major metabolic ailments globally wherein patients also often suffer from cardiac disorders, a comprehensive genetic and pharmacogenomic understanding of these conditions enable the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

The availability of high-throughput genotyping and sequencing platforms has largely removed technological barriers in the mapping the genetic determinants of drug response in human populations, and the set of validated pharmacogenetic variants is gradually increasing. Like the search for disease-susceptibility variation, however, many of the loci identified to date represent the relatively low-hanging fruit with large phenotypic effects but relatively low predictive power. Yet to be discovered is the larger set of variants, each with considerably weaker phenotypic effects, which together can be used to predict drug response more reliably and identify potential targets for novel drug development. Finding these pharmacogenetic variants is particularly challenging because sample size is typically far too small (and thus statistically underpowered) to detect genetic variants with weak effects. Studies of the genetics of gene expression (also described as expression quantitative locus (eQTL) mapping or genetical genomics) represent a novel approach for identification of functional genetic variants that influence gene expression. In these studies, individual gene transcript abundance as measured from expression microarrays are considered as discrete quantitative traits for genetic mapping that are intermediate to clinical outcomes of interest. Early studies using these methods have demonstrated improved power to detect such regulatory variants and have facilitated mapping of disease-susceptibility variants. The potential use of this approach in the study of pharmacogenetics and for the identification of potentially modifiable drug targets is reviewed here.	175	180	ORGANISM	human

At the same time, a clear relationship between drug levels and response also exists for imatinib in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Therefore, pharmacogenetic-based dosing of imatinib is an attractive proposition. This study aims to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of imatinib in order to identify significant covariates including pharmacogenetic variants.	216	241	CANCER	chronic myeloid leukaemia

Although treatment outcome has improved owing to advances in chemotherapy, there is still a group of patients for which therapy fails while some patients experience severe toxicity. In the last few years, several pharmacogenetic studies have been performed to search for markers of outcome and toxicity in pediatric ALL. However, to date, TPMT is the only pharmacogenetic marker in ALL with clinical guidelines for drug dosing. In this article, we will provide an overview of the most important findings carried out in pharmacogenetics for pediatric ALL, such as the interest drawn by methotrexate transporters in the context of methotrexate treatment. Even if most of the studies are centered on coding genes, we will also point to new approaches focusing on noncoding regions and epigenetic variation that could be interesting for consideration in the near future.	58	64	CANCER	cancer

Heart disease is a major cause of death in US and worldwide. The complex interplay of the mechanisms between diabetes, obesity and inflammation raises concerns for therapeutic understanding and developing treatment options for patients. Recent advances utilizing pharmacogenomics has helped researchers to probe in to disease pathophysiology and physicians to detect and, diagnose the disease in patients. The understanding developed in the area primarily addresses the issue focusing on the nature and asks the question 'Why' some individuals respond to the standard medication regimen and others do not. The central idea that genomics play a vital part in how the healthcare providers: physician, pharmacist, and nurse provide treatment utilizing the best practices available for maximum benefits. Pharmacogenomics is the scientific basis which offers the fundamental understanding for diseases, based on which therapeutic approaches can be designed and delivered. The discovery that not all humans respond to the drug in the same way is a 'paradigm shift' in how current therapies are offered. The area of pharmacogenomics at its core is linked to the genetic basis for the disease and the response to treatment. Given that diabetes and obesity are major metabolic ailments globally wherein patients also often suffer from cardiac disorders, a comprehensive genetic and pharmacogenomic understanding of these conditions enable the development of effective therapeutic strategies. In this review, we discuss various pharmacogenomic approaches with special emphasis on heart disease as it relates to diabetes and obesity.

The purpose of this pharmacokinetics (PK) study was to investigate whether different release kinetics from bupropion hydrochloride (HCl) immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (ER) formulations alter its metabolism and to test the hypothesis that the unsuccessful bioequivalence (BE) study of the higher strength (300 mg) of bupropion HCl ER tablets based on the successful BE study of the lower strength (150 mg) was due to metabolic saturation in the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen. A randomized six-way crossover study was conducted in healthy volunteers. During each period, subjects took a single dose of IR (75/100 mg), SR (100/150 mg), or ER (150/300 mg) formulations of bupropion HCl; plasma samples for PK analysis were collected from 0-96 h for all formulations. In addition, each subject's whole blood was collected for the genotyping of various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of bupropion's major metabolic enzymes. The data indicates that the relative bioavailability of the ER formulations was 72.3-78.8% compared with IR 75 mg. No differences were observed for ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) of metabolite to AUC of parent for the three major metabolites. The pharmacogenomics analysis suggested no statistically significant correlation between polymorphisms and PK parameters of the various formulations. Altogether, these data suggested that the different release kinetics of the formulations did not change metabolites-to-parent ratio. Therefore, the differing BE result between the 150 and 300 mg bupropion HCl ER tablets was unlikely due to the metabolic saturation in the GI lumen caused by different release patterns.	310	312	CANCER	BE

Numerous modifications of the 5-FU structure have been performed in order to overcome these disadvantages.	163	166	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Understanding gene-environment interactions that may influence disease is the cornerstone of a personalized medicine approach built on diagnostics, risk assessment/risk modification, pharmacogenetics and biology. Although genetic and personalized medicine can influence clinical decision making, currently most genetic information is based on populations of European ancestry. Additional human genome research must include diverse populations in order to assess the impact DNA sequence variation and environmental influences have on human disease risk. Within this article, we present a brief overview of human genome variation and discuss how epigenomics may influence gene expression. Examples of gene-environment interactions are explored and linked to several health disparities and health outcomes among communities of color. With the Jackson Heart Study poised to take the next steps in examining genes and the environment in ways that other cohorts cannot, we will be closer to a more inclusive personalized medicine goal that transforms medicine from curative to preemptive for all.	473	476	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Coronary artery disease (CAD) has a high mortality rate. Despite various therapeutic targets, non-responsiveness to drugs remains a prevalent issue. Pharmacogenomics assesses the way an individual's genetic attributes affect their likely response to drug therapy. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms play a crucial role in determining these outcomes. This review offers an overview of single-nucleotide polymorphisms investigated in clinical studies and their associations with drug response/nonresponse in the treatment of CAD. A total of 104 studies of whole sets of chromosomes and several genes were explored. A total of 161 polymorphisms exhibited associations with drug response/nonresponse in CAD across diverse ethnic populations. This pool can serve as a pharmacogenomic biomarker for predicting response to drug therapy in patients with CAD.	565	576	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	chromosomes
The optimal dose of warfarin depends on polymorphisms in the VKORC1 (the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit (1) and CYP2C9 (cytochrome P450 2C9) genes. To minimize the risk of adverse reactions, warfarin dosages should be adjusted according to results from rapid and simple monitoring methods. However, there are few pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithms that are based on large cohorts from the Chinese population, especially patients with atrial fibrillation. This study aimed to validate a pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithm based on results from a new rapid electrochemical detection method used in a multicenter study. Three SNPs (CYP2C9 *2, *3 and VKORC1 c.-1639G > A) were genotyped by electrochemical detection using a sandwich-type format that included a 3' short thiol capture probe and a 5' ferrocene-labeled signal probe. A total of 1285 samples from four clinical hospitals were evaluated. Concordance rates between the results from the electrochemical DNA biosensor and the sequencing test were 99.8%. The results for gene distribution showed that most Chinese patients had higher warfarin susceptibility because mutant-type and heterozygotes were present in the majority of subjects (99.4%) at locus c.-1639G > A. When the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium algorithm was used to estimate therapeutic dosages for 362 patients with AF and the values were compared with their actual dosages, the results revealed that 56.9% were similar to actual dosages (within the 20% range). A novel electrochemical detection method of CYP2C9 *2, *3and VKORC1 c.-1639G > A alleles was evaluated. The warfarin dosing algorithm based on data gathered from a large patient cohort can facilitate the reasonable and effective use of warfarin in Chinese patients with AF.	799	807	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	3' short

Aminoglycosides are widely used antibiotics with notable side effects, such as nephrotoxicity, vestibulotoxicity, and sensorineural hearing loss (cochleotoxicity). MT-RNR1 is a gene that encodes the 12s rRNA subunit and is the mitochondrial homologue of the prokaryotic 16s rRNA. Some MT-RNR1 variants (i.e., m.1095T>C; m.1494C>T; m.1555A>G) more closely resemble the bacterial 16s rRNA subunit and result in increased risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. Use of aminoglycosides should be avoided in individuals with an MT-RNR1 variant associated with an increased risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss unless the high risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and safe or effective alternative therapies are not available. We summarize evidence from the literature supporting this association and provide therapeutic recommendations for the use of aminoglycosides based on MT-RNR1 genotype (updates at https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/ and www.pharmgkb.org).	227	240	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	mitochondrial
Genotyping of gDNA rs12041331 (PEAR1), rs6065 (GP1BA), and rs730012 (LTC4S) can provide systematic guidance on the use of aspirin. However, an accurate, reliable and economical approach to simultaneous detection of the above single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is not reported. Herein, we designed and substantiated an allele-specific (AS) forward primer-superposed amplification analysis for measurement of the SNPs in PEAR1, GP1BA and LTC4S genes, in which the values of ∆Cq (differences in threshold cycles between the wild-type forward primer-based assay and the mutated-type forward primer-based assay) were employed to decide genotype. Mismatch AS forward primers were screened with the singleplex amplification analysis. Moreover, Cq extension optimized by AS forward primer superposition was observed in the selected forward primer-based triplex analysis. Further, robustness assessment of the triplex analysis showed the amplification efficiency ranging from 0.9 to 1.1. Precision test demonstrated the coefficient of variation of less than 2%. And the detective results of 189 DNA samples was completely concordant with that of commercial Sanger sequencing. In summary, we developed a simple, accurate and economical approach to genotyping of rs12041331 (PEAR1), rs6065 (GP1BA) and rs730012 (LTC4S) to provide a valuable pharmacogenomics tool for guidance of aspirin delivery.	14	18	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	gDNA

Vinblastine and vincristine are dimeric indole alkaloids derived from Catharanthus roseus (formerly: Vinca rosea). Their monomeric precursor molecules are vindoline and catharanthine. While vinblastine and vincristine are well-known mitotic spindle poisons, not much is known about vindoline and catharanthine. Vindoline and catharanthine showed weak cytotoxicity, while vinblastine, vincristine, and the semisynthetic vindesine and vinorelbine revealed high cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. This may reflect a general biological principle of poisonous plants. Highly toxic compounds are not only active towards predators, but also towards plant tissues. Hence, plants need mechanisms to protect themselves from their own poisons. One evolutionary strategy to solve this problem is to generate less toxic precursors, which are dimerized to toxic end products when needed. As shown by in silico molecular docking and biochemical approaches, vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine bound with high affinity to α/β-tubulin and inhibited tubulin polymerization, whereas the effects of vindoline and catharanthine were weak. Similarly, vinblastine produced high fractions of mono- and multipolar mitotic spindles, while vindoline and catharanthine did only weakly affect bipolar mitotic spindle formation. Here, we show that vinblastine contributes to cell death by interference with spindle polarity. P-glycoprotein-overexpressing multidrug-resistant CEM/VCR1000 cells were highly resistant towards vincristine and cross-resistant to vinblastine, vindesine, and vinorelbine, but not or only weakly cross-resistant to vindoline and catharanthine. In addition to tubulin as primary target, microarray-based mRNA signatures of responsiveness of these compounds have been identified by COMPARE and signaling pathway profiling.	1183	1193	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	multipolar
Effective management of sickle cell pain entails a thorough understanding of its pathophysiology and the pharmacogenomics of the opioids used to manage it. In recent years, there has been significant progress along these two lines. At the pathophysiologic level, there is evidence that the severity and frequency of painful stimuli modulate their transmission at the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This modulation is achieved via two channels: the α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and NMDA receptors. Initially, the AMPA channel controls the transmission of stimuli of mild-moderate severity. Once the AMPA channel reaches its limit of membrane depolarization, the NMDA channel is activated and facilitates the transmission of painful stimuli in a progressive fashion leading to central sensitization and glial activation. At the level of pharmacogenomics, the metabolism of each opioid is patient-specific. Glucuronidation is unique for the metabolism of morphine, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone. The metabolism of all other opioids requires specific Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. The activity of each isoenzyme and the activity of the metabolites of each opioid vary among patients depending on their genetic makeup and coexistent environmental factors such as the use of other medications that may enhance or inhibit the CYP isoenzyme activity.	677	685	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	membrane
One of the unsolved mysteries of medicine is how do volatile anesthetics (VAs) cause a patient to reversibly lose consciousness. In addition, identifying mechanisms for the collateral effects of VAs, including anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (AiN) and anesthetic preconditioning (AP), has proven challenging. Multiple classes of molecules (lipids, proteins, and water) have been considered as potential VA targets, but recently proteins have received the most attention. Studies targeting neuronal receptors or ion channels had limited success in identifying the critical targets of VAs mediating either the phenotype of "anesthesia" or their collateral effects. Recent studies in both nematodes and fruit flies may provide a paradigm shift by suggesting that mitochondria may harbor the upstream molecular switch activating both primary and collateral effects. The disruption of a specific step of electron transfer within the mitochondrion causes hypersensitivity to VAs, from nematodes to <i>Drosophila</i> and to humans, while also modulating the sensitivity to collateral effects. The downstream effects from mitochondrial inhibition are potentially legion, but inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter cycling appears to be specifically sensitive to the mitochondrial effects. These findings are perhaps of even broader interest since two recent reports indicate that mitochondrial damage may well underlie neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of VAs in the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, important to understand how anesthetics interact with mitochondria to affect CNS function, not just for the desired facets of general anesthesia but also for significant collateral effects, both harmful and beneficial. A tantalizing possibility exists that both the primary (anesthesia) and secondary (AiN, AP) mechanisms may at least partially overlap in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).	761	773	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	mitochondria

These findings are perhaps of even broader interest since two recent reports indicate that mitochondrial damage may well underlie neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of VAs in the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, important to understand how anesthetics interact with mitochondria to affect CNS function, not just for the desired facets of general anesthesia but also for significant collateral effects, both harmful and beneficial. A tantalizing possibility exists that both the primary (anesthesia) and secondary (AiN, AP) mechanisms may at least partially overlap in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).	1571	1583	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	mitochondria
One of the unsolved mysteries of medicine is how do volatile anesthetics (VAs) cause a patient to reversibly lose consciousness. In addition, identifying mechanisms for the collateral effects of VAs, including anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (AiN) and anesthetic preconditioning (AP), has proven challenging. Multiple classes of molecules (lipids, proteins, and water) have been considered as potential VA targets, but recently proteins have received the most attention. Studies targeting neuronal receptors or ion channels had limited success in identifying the critical targets of VAs mediating either the phenotype of "anesthesia" or their collateral effects. Recent studies in both nematodes and fruit flies may provide a paradigm shift by suggesting that mitochondria may harbor the upstream molecular switch activating both primary and collateral effects.

<b>Introduction:</b> Research in the field of pharmacogenomics (PGx) aims to identify genetic variants that modulate response to drugs, through alterations in their pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD). The distribution of PGx variants differs considerably among populations, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) plays a major role as a comprehensive approach to detect both common and rare variants. This study evaluated the frequency of PGx markers in the context of the Brazilian population, using data from a population-based admixed cohort from Sao Paulo, Brazil, which includes variants from WGS of 1,171 unrelated, elderly individuals. <b>Methods:</b> The Stargazer tool was used to call star alleles and structural variants (SVs) from 38 pharmacogenes. Clinically relevant variants were investigated, and the predicted drug response phenotype was analyzed in combination with the medication record to assess individuals potentially at high-risk of gene-drug interaction. <b>Results:</b> In total, 352 unique star alleles or haplotypes were observed, of which 255 and 199 had a frequency < 0.05 and < 0.01, respectively. For star alleles with frequency > 5% (<i>n</i> = 97), decreased, loss-of-function and unknown function accounted for 13.4%, 8.2% and 27.8% of alleles or haplotypes, respectively. Structural variants (SVs) were identified in 35 genes for at least one individual, and occurred with frequencies >5% for CYP2D6, CYP2A6, GSTM1, and UGT2B17. Overall 98.0% of the individuals carried at least one high risk genotype-predicted phenotype in pharmacogenes with PharmGKB level of evidence 1A for drug interaction. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) Priority Result Notation and the cohort medication registry were combined to assess high-risk gene-drug interactions. In general, 42.0% of the cohort used at least one PharmGKB evidence level 1A drug, and 18.9% of individuals who used PharmGKB evidence level 1A drugs had a genotype-predicted phenotype of high-risk gene-drug interaction. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study described the applicability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques for translating PGx variants into clinically relevant phenotypes on a large scale in the Brazilian population and explores the feasibility of systematic adoption of PGx testing in Brazil.	740	743	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	SVs

Breast cancer arises as a result of multiple interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Conventionally, breast cancer is treated based on histopathological and clinical features. DNA technologies like the human genome microarray are now partially integrated into clinical practice and are used for developing new "personalized medicines" and "pharmacogenetics" for improving the efficiency and safety of cancer medications. We investigated the effects of four established therapies-for ER+ ductal breast cancer-on the differential gene expression. The therapies included single agent tamoxifen, two-agent docetaxel and capecitabine, or combined three-agents CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil) and CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). Genevestigator 8.1.0 was used to compare five datasets from patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, untreated or treated with selected drugs, to those from the healthy control. We identified 74 differentially expressed genes involved in three pathways, i.e., apoptosis (extrinsic and intrinsic), oxidative signaling, and PI3K/Akt signaling. The treatments affected the expression of apoptotic genes (<i>TNFRSF10B</i> [<i>TRAIL</i>], <i>FAS</i>, <i>CASP3/6/7/8</i>, <i>PMAIP1</i> [<i>NOXA</i>], <i>BNIP3L</i>, <i>BNIP3</i>, <i>BCL2A1</i>, and <i>BCL2</i>), the oxidative stress-related genes (<i>NOX4</i>, <i>XDH</i>, <i>MAOA</i>, <i>GSR</i>, <i>GPX3</i>, and <i>SOD3</i>), and the PI3K/Akt pathway gene (<i>ERBB2</i> [<i>HER2</i>]). Breast cancer treatments are complex with varying drug responses and efficacy among patients. This necessitates identifying novel biomarkers for predicting the drug response, using available data and new technologies. <i>GSR</i>, <i>NOX4</i>, <i>CASP3</i>, and <i>ERBB2</i> are potential biomarkers for predicting the treatment response in primary ER+ ductal breast carcinoma.	192	195	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Anti-cancer chemotherapy often induces peripheral neuropathy and consequent cognitive and quality of life impairment. Guidelines recommend antiepileptics or antidepressants but their efficacy is limited.Dextromethorphan, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has shown its efficacy in painful diabetic neuropathy and in post-operative pain but has not been studied in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. This clinical trial evaluates the effect of dextromethorphan on pain, cognition and quality of life in patients who suffer from neuropathic pain induced by chemotherapy for breast cancer. It also assesses the impact of dextromethorphan genetic polymorphism on analgesia.	39	49	TISSUE	peripheral
The pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus can be partly explained by CYP3A5 activity. Our objective was to evaluate a tacrolimus sparing policy on renal graft outcome according to <i>CYP3A5</i> 6986A>G genetic polymorphism. This retrospective study included 1114 recipients with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Genotyping of the 6986A>G allelic variant corresponding to <i>CYP3A5*3</i> was systematically performed. One year after transplantation, tacrolimus blood trough concentration (C0) target range was 5-7 ng/mL. However, daily dose was capped to 0.10 mg/kg/day regardless of the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype. A total 208 <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients were included. Despite a higher daily dose, <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients exhibited lower C0 during follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of <i>CYP3A5*1</i>/- genotype (HR = 0.70, 0.46-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.10) on patient-graft survival. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline was significantly lower for the <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> genotype did not significantly impact the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (HR = 1.01, 0.68-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.97) despite significantly lower C0. Based on our experience, a strategy of tacrolimus capping is associated with a better GFR evolution in <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients without any significant increase of BPAR incidence. Our study raised some issues about specific therapeutic tacrolimus C0 targets for <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients and suggests to set up randomized control studies in this specific population.	940	950	TISSUE	Glomerular
Allogenic solid organ transplantation has become the routine procedure in patients with end stage organ disease. Although the transplanted organ compensates deficient body functions, its allogenic nature requires institution of immune tolerance, nowadays provided by immunosuppressive drug administration. Both the safety and efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment depend on many factors, and maintaining levels of immunosuppressants within therapeutic range is the essential target for success in graft function preservation. It is obvious that drug and metabolite concentrations depend on efficiency of individual patient metabolism. Recently, many studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between genetic factors, drug pharmacokinetics and therapy outcome, and interindividual variability apparently can be explained, at least in part, by genetically determined polymorphisms of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, transport proteins and also in some cases, drug targets. This review presents the recent state of knowledge in the field of pharmacogenetics related to solid organ transplantation.	499	504	TISSUE	graft
RNA interference (RNAi) is a process for regulating the gene expression in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silence target genes. siRNA-based therapy as a new molecular treatment approach, offers therapeutic prospects for many common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Nevertheless, the efficacy of siRNA delivery has, so far, remained a challenging issue. This is due to their easy degradation through the circulation system and the difficulties in the intracellular delivery to specific tissues where they silence the target genes. There have been many efforts to develop suitable, safe and effective siRNA delivery systems in the past decades. These efforts specifically aimed to protect siRNA from serum nucleases and deliver it to an intracellular region in the desired target cells. In this context, one of the new and popular approaches is nanovehicle-mediated siRNA delivery systems.	513	520	TISSUE	tissues
Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.	979	991	TISSUE	brain tissue

A postulated role of subcortical neuromodulators is to control brain states. Mechanisms by which different neuromodulators compete or cooperate at various temporal scales remain an open question. We investigated the interaction of acetylcholine (ACh) and oxytocin (OXT) at slow and fast timescales during various brain states. Although these neuromodulators fluctuated in parallel during NREM packets, transitions from NREM to REM were characterized by a surge of ACh but a continued decrease of OXT. OXT signaling lagged behind ACh. High ACh was correlated with population synchrony and gamma oscillations during active waking, whereas minimum ACh predicts sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs). Optogenetic control of ACh and OXT neurons confirmed the active role of these neuromodulators in the observed correlations. Synchronous hippocampal activity consistently reduced OXT activity, whereas inactivation of the lateral septum-hypothalamus path attenuated this effect. Our findings demonstrate how cooperative actions of these neuromodulators allow target circuits to perform specific functions.	823	834	TISSUE	hippocampal

Vinblastine and vincristine are dimeric indole alkaloids derived from Catharanthus roseus (formerly: Vinca rosea). Their monomeric precursor molecules are vindoline and catharanthine. While vinblastine and vincristine are well-known mitotic spindle poisons, not much is known about vindoline and catharanthine. Vindoline and catharanthine showed weak cytotoxicity, while vinblastine, vincristine, and the semisynthetic vindesine and vinorelbine revealed high cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. This may reflect a general biological principle of poisonous plants. Highly toxic compounds are not only active towards predators, but also towards plant tissues. Hence, plants need mechanisms to protect themselves from their own poisons. One evolutionary strategy to solve this problem is to generate less toxic precursors, which are dimerized to toxic end products when needed. As shown by in silico molecular docking and biochemical approaches, vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine bound with high affinity to α/β-tubulin and inhibited tubulin polymerization, whereas the effects of vindoline and catharanthine were weak. Similarly, vinblastine produced high fractions of mono- and multipolar mitotic spindles, while vindoline and catharanthine did only weakly affect bipolar mitotic spindle formation. Here, we show that vinblastine contributes to cell death by interference with spindle polarity. P-glycoprotein-overexpressing multidrug-resistant CEM/VCR1000 cells were highly resistant towards vincristine and cross-resistant to vinblastine, vindesine, and vinorelbine, but not or only weakly cross-resistant to vindoline and catharanthine. In addition to tubulin as primary target, microarray-based mRNA signatures of responsiveness of these compounds have been identified by COMPARE and signaling pathway profiling.	648	655	TISSUE	tissues
One of the unsolved mysteries of medicine is how do volatile anesthetics (VAs) cause a patient to reversibly lose consciousness. In addition, identifying mechanisms for the collateral effects of VAs, including anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (AiN) and anesthetic preconditioning (AP), has proven challenging. Multiple classes of molecules (lipids, proteins, and water) have been considered as potential VA targets, but recently proteins have received the most attention. Studies targeting neuronal receptors or ion channels had limited success in identifying the critical targets of VAs mediating either the phenotype of "anesthesia" or their collateral effects. Recent studies in both nematodes and fruit flies may provide a paradigm shift by suggesting that mitochondria may harbor the upstream molecular switch activating both primary and collateral effects. The disruption of a specific step of electron transfer within the mitochondrion causes hypersensitivity to VAs, from nematodes to <i>Drosophila</i> and to humans, while also modulating the sensitivity to collateral effects. The downstream effects from mitochondrial inhibition are potentially legion, but inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter cycling appears to be specifically sensitive to the mitochondrial effects. These findings are perhaps of even broader interest since two recent reports indicate that mitochondrial damage may well underlie neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of VAs in the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, important to understand how anesthetics interact with mitochondria to affect CNS function, not just for the desired facets of general anesthesia but also for significant collateral effects, both harmful and beneficial. A tantalizing possibility exists that both the primary (anesthesia) and secondary (AiN, AP) mechanisms may at least partially overlap in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).	173	183	TISSUE	collateral

We systematically collected eligible data to measure the effect of CYP3A5*1 expression on personalized tacrolimus therapy. Six databases were searched for studies on adult liver transplant recipients and donors of liver graft which reported tacrolimus dose requirement, trough blood concentration, and/or concentration/dose (C/D) ratio in expressers and nonexpressers of CYP3A5*1. Eligible data were pooled by meta-analysis. Sixteen observational studies (1309 recipients, 1044 donors of liver graft) were included in the analyses. Tacrolimus C/D ratio was lower, and the dose was higher in recipient expressers of CYP3A5*1 and/or carriers of expresser liver graft at 1-4 weeks and 2-4, 6, and 12 months post-transplantation. Tacrolimus blood concentration was lower at the first two weeks. Pair expressers were affected by about twofold, and the effect was different between ethnic groups. CYP3A5*1 expression in recipients increased tacrolimus required dose by 0.023 at first, 0.022 at third, and 0.012 mg/kg/day at sixth month. Its expression in graft tissue increased tacrolimus required dose by 0.024 at first, 0.035 at third, and 0.032 mg/kg/day at sixth month. Considering CYP3A5*1 polymorphism can be helpful in individualization of tacrolimus efficient dose prior to administration, and it can remove initial high-risk lag time (over/underdose period before reaching target blood level) at first few days post-transplantation.	214	225	TISSUE	liver graft

Considering CYP3A5*1 polymorphism can be helpful in individualization of tacrolimus efficient dose prior to administration, and it can remove initial high-risk lag time (over/underdose period before reaching target blood level) at first few days post-transplantation.	1049	1061	TISSUE	graft tissue
Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies. The classical symptoms of FXIII deficiency span from intracranial haemorrhage to delay bleeding or the staying of chronic wounds in the skin including impaired mucosal healing. In this view, FXIII bridges primary haemostasis, coagulation and definite tissue healing. Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing. Accordingly, adequate FXIII levels can drive and predict the prognosis of complex diseases and the outcome of the associated therapies or interventions. In addition, peculiar pharmacogenetics aspects of the FXIII gene are of extraordinary interest. The present review accounts for the recognized role of FXIII in the healing process and gives some examples on how to use it as prognostic biological/ molecular marker or as potential tailored therapeutic molecule in complex diseases.	159	165	TISSUE	tissue

Apixaban and rivaroxaban are the two most prescribed direct factor Xa inhibitors. With the increased use of DOACs in real-world settings, safety and efficacy concerns have emerged, particularly regarding their concomitant use with other drugs. Increasing evidence highlights drug−drug interactions with CYP3A/P-gp modulators leading to adverse events. However, current recommendations for dose adjustment do not consider CYP3A/P-gp genotype and phenotype. We aimed to determine their impact on apixaban and rivaroxaban blood exposure. Three-hundred hospitalized patients were included. CYP3A and P-gp phenotypic activities were assessed by the metabolic ratio of midazolam and AUC0−6h of fexofenadine, respectively. Relevant CYP3A and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms were also tested. Capillary blood samples collected at four time-points after apixaban or rivaroxaban administration allowed the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. According to the developed multivariable linear regression models, P-gp activity (p < 0.001) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) (p = 0.01) significantly affected apixaban AUC0−6h. P-gp activity (p < 0.001) also significantly impacted rivaroxaban AUC0−6h. The phenotypic switch (from normal to poor metabolizer) of P-gp led to an increase of apixaban and rivaroxaban AUC0−6h by 16% and 25%, respectively, equivalent to a decrease of 38 mL/min in CrCl according to the apixaban model. CYP3A phenotype and tested SNPs of CYP3A/P-gp had no significant impact. In conclusion, P-gp phenotypic activity, rather than known CYP3A/P-gp polymorphisms, could be relevant for dose adjustment.	781	804	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	Capillary blood samples
Oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy has been the main treatment approach for stroke prevention for decades. Warfarin is the most widely prescribed OAC in the United States, but is difficult to manage due to variability in dose requirements across individuals. Pharmacogenomics may mitigate risk concerns related to warfarin use by fostering the opportunity to facilitate individualized medicine approaches to warfarin treatment (e.g., genome-guided dosing). While various economic evaluations exist examining the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics testing for warfarin, few observational studies exist to support these studies, with even fewer using genotype as the main exposure of interest. We examined a cohort of individuals initiating warfarin therapy between 2004 and 2017 and examined bleeding and cost outcomes for the year following initiation using Mayo Clinic's billing and administrative data, as well the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cost Data Warehouse. Analyses included descriptive summaries, comparison of characteristics across exposure groups, reporting of crude outcomes, and multivariate analyses. We included N = 1,143 patients for analyses. Just over a third of our study population (34.9%) carried a warfarin-sensitive phenotype. Sensitive individuals differed in their baseline characteristics by being of older age and having a higher number of comorbid conditions; myocardial infarction, diabetes, and cancer in particular. The occurrence of bleeding events was not significantly different across exposure groups. No significant differences across exposure groups existed in either the likelihood of incurring all-cause healthcare costs or in the magnitude of those costs. Warfarin-sensitive individuals were no more likely to utilize cardiovascular-related healthcare services; however, they had lower total and inpatient cardiovascular-related costs compared to warfarin-insensitive patients. No significant differences existed in any other categories of costs. We found limited evidence that warfarin-sensitive individuals have different healthcare spending than warfarin-insensitive individuals. Additional real-world studies are needed to support the traditional economic evaluations currently existing in the literature.	1386	1396	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	myocardial
The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril is hydrolysed to an active metabolite, enalaprilat, in the liver via carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). Previous studies show that variant rs71647871 in the CES1 gene affects the pharmacokinetics of enalapril on liver samples as well as healthy volunteers. This study included 286 Caucasian patients with arterial hypertension who received enalapril. The concentrations of enalapril and enalaprilat were determined before subsequent intake of the drug and 4 h after it with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometric detection. The study included genetic markers as follows: rs2244613, rs71647871 (c.428G>A, p.G143E) and three SNPs indicating the presence of a subtype CES1A1c (rs12149368, rs111604615 and rs201577108). Mean peak and trough enalaprilat concentrations, adjusted by clinical variables, were significantly lower in CES1 rs2244613 heterozygotes (by 16.6% and 19.6%) and in CC homozygotes (by 32.7% and 41.4%) vs. the AA genotype. In CES1A1c homozygotes, adjusted mean enalaprilat concentrations were 75% lower vs. heterozygotes and wild-type (WT) homozygotes. Pharmacogenetic markers of the CES1 gene may be a promising predictor for individualisation when prescribing enalapril.	351	359	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	arterial

Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.	1299	1316	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	brain compartment
Coronary artery disease (CAD) has a high mortality rate. Despite various therapeutic targets, non-responsiveness to drugs remains a prevalent issue. Pharmacogenomics assesses the way an individual's genetic attributes affect their likely response to drug therapy. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms play a crucial role in determining these outcomes. This review offers an overview of single-nucleotide polymorphisms investigated in clinical studies and their associations with drug response/nonresponse in the treatment of CAD. A total of 104 studies of whole sets of chromosomes and several genes were explored. A total of 161 polymorphisms exhibited associations with drug response/nonresponse in CAD across diverse ethnic populations. This pool can serve as a pharmacogenomic biomarker for predicting response to drug therapy in patients with CAD.	0	15	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	Coronary artery
Effective management of sickle cell pain entails a thorough understanding of its pathophysiology and the pharmacogenomics of the opioids used to manage it. In recent years, there has been significant progress along these two lines. At the pathophysiologic level, there is evidence that the severity and frequency of painful stimuli modulate their transmission at the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This modulation is achieved via two channels: the α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and NMDA receptors. Initially, the AMPA channel controls the transmission of stimuli of mild-moderate severity. Once the AMPA channel reaches its limit of membrane depolarization, the NMDA channel is activated and facilitates the transmission of painful stimuli in a progressive fashion leading to central sensitization and glial activation. At the level of pharmacogenomics, the metabolism of each opioid is patient-specific. Glucuronidation is unique for the metabolism of morphine, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone. The metabolism of all other opioids requires specific Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. The activity of each isoenzyme and the activity of the metabolites of each opioid vary among patients depending on their genetic makeup and coexistent environmental factors such as the use of other medications that may enhance or inhibit the CYP isoenzyme activity.	380	391	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	dorsal horn
One of the unsolved mysteries of medicine is how do volatile anesthetics (VAs) cause a patient to reversibly lose consciousness. In addition, identifying mechanisms for the collateral effects of VAs, including anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (AiN) and anesthetic preconditioning (AP), has proven challenging. Multiple classes of molecules (lipids, proteins, and water) have been considered as potential VA targets, but recently proteins have received the most attention. Studies targeting neuronal receptors or ion channels had limited success in identifying the critical targets of VAs mediating either the phenotype of "anesthesia" or their collateral effects. Recent studies in both nematodes and fruit flies may provide a paradigm shift by suggesting that mitochondria may harbor the upstream molecular switch activating both primary and collateral effects. The disruption of a specific step of electron transfer within the mitochondrion causes hypersensitivity to VAs, from nematodes to <i>Drosophila</i> and to humans, while also modulating the sensitivity to collateral effects. The downstream effects from mitochondrial inhibition are potentially legion, but inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter cycling appears to be specifically sensitive to the mitochondrial effects. These findings are perhaps of even broader interest since two recent reports indicate that mitochondrial damage may well underlie neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of VAs in the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, important to understand how anesthetics interact with mitochondria to affect CNS function, not just for the desired facets of general anesthesia but also for significant collateral effects, both harmful and beneficial. A tantalizing possibility exists that both the primary (anesthesia) and secondary (AiN, AP) mechanisms may at least partially overlap in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).	1687	1697	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	collateral
The use of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) has become an integral part of supportive care during cytotoxic chemotherapy. Current guidelines recommend the use of G-CSF in patients with substantial risk of febrile neutropenia. However, little consensus exists about optimal timing and tailoring of this therapy. Based on the known effects of chemotherapy and G-CSF on bone marrow compartments, we propose a model that supports the prophylactic rather than therapeutic use of G-CSF therapy. In addition, several genetic alterations in G-CSF signalling pathway have been described. These genetic variants may predict the risk of febrile neutropenia and response to G-CSF. Thus, future pharmacogenetic/omics studies in this field are warranted. Through the identification of patients at risk and the knowledge of biological basis for optimal timing, hopefully we should soon be able to improve the application of the existing guidelines for G-CSF therapy and patient's prognosis.	399	410	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	bone marrow
This article surveys efforts on text mining of the pharmacogenomics literature, mainly from the period 2008 to 2011. Pharmacogenomics (or pharmacogenetics) is the field that studies how human genetic variation impacts drug response. Therefore, publications span the intersection of research in genotypes, phenotypes and pharmacology, a topic that has increasingly become a focus of active research in recent years. This survey covers efforts dealing with the automatic recognition of relevant named entities (e.g. genes, gene variants and proteins, diseases and other pathological phenomena, drugs and other chemicals relevant for medical treatment), as well as various forms of relations between them. A wide range of text genres is considered, such as scientific publications (abstracts, as well as full texts), patent texts and clinical narratives. We also discuss infrastructure and resources needed for advanced text analytics, e.g. document corpora annotated with corresponding semantic metadata (gold standards and training data), biomedical terminologies and ontologies providing domain-specific background knowledge at different levels of formality and specificity, software architectures for building complex and scalable text analytics pipelines and Web services grounded to them, as well as comprehensive ways to disseminate and interact with the typically huge amounts of semiformal knowledge structures extracted by text mining tools. Finally, we consider some of the novel applications that have already been developed in the field of pharmacogenomic text mining and point out perspectives for future research.	947	954	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	corpora
Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies. The classical symptoms of FXIII deficiency span from intracranial haemorrhage to delay bleeding or the staying of chronic wounds in the skin including impaired mucosal healing. In this view, FXIII bridges primary haemostasis, coagulation and definite tissue healing. Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing. Accordingly, adequate FXIII levels can drive and predict the prognosis of complex diseases and the outcome of the associated therapies or interventions. In addition, peculiar pharmacogenetics aspects of the FXIII gene are of extraordinary interest.

Landmark early work has led to the nearly universal use of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity with pregnancies complicated by impending preterm birth. Antenatal corticosteroids clearly reduce respiratory morbidity, death, and other adverse neonatal outcomes. Limited pregnant human pharmacokinetic data and some animal data give clinicians some information as to the behavior of the drug in the body. However, there is controversy about the type, amount, and frequency of steroid to use for this therapy. This review article summarizes the history, clinical use, and pharmacology of antenatal steroids. In addition, the review highlights some potential mediators of steroid response and current research strategies aimed at possible optimization of this therapy.	99	109	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	fetal lung
Personalized medicine is defined as individualized treatment based on the individual's genetic variants. Such treatment has the potential to enable pharmacogenetics, such as the prevention of 100,000 deaths per year in the USA because of adverse drug reactions or specify treatment in heart failure such at the beta 1 adrenergic receptor polymorphisms. It is claimed that coronary artery disease (CAD) is at least 50% because of genetic predisposition. Identification of the genes predisposing to CAD would greatly facilitate prevention, early treatment, and more specific therapies. The arrival of the multimillion single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array provides the high throughput genotyping required to perform genome-wide Association (GWA) studies. These studies require markers (SNPs) at intervals of 6,000 bp and sample size of several thousands. Platforms are available to genotype and process millions of genotypes per day. The GWA performed by the Ottawa Heart Genomic Study identified the first deoxyribonucleic acid region (9p21) predisposing to CAD after replication in six independent populations totaling 23,000. This was subsequently confirmed in several independent studies totally more than 45,000 individuals. The region confers a risk for CAD independent of known risk factors. 9p21 occurs in heterozygous form in 40 to 50% of Caucasians with increased risk of 15 to 20% and in homozygous form in 25% of Caucasians with increased risk of 40%. Identification of the genes predisposing to CAD is a prerequisite for personalized care of these patients. It is anticipated that most of the genes predisposing to CAD will be identified in the next 5 to 8 years. The 9p21, in addition to conferring increased risk, provides the bonus of being independent of known risk factors. Thus, 9p21 is likely to provide the impetus and nidus for a major research effort over the next few years. It has the potential to not only provide for early genetic screening but also as a target for novel therapy.	372	387	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary artery

Nimodipine, an L-type cerebroselective calcium channel antagonist, is the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the neuroprotection of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Four randomized, placebo-controlled trials of nimodipine demonstrated clinical improvement over placebo; however, these occurred before precision medicine with pharmacogenomics was readily available. The standard enteral dose of nimodipine recommended after aSAH is 60 mg every 4 h. However, up to 78% of patients with aSAH develop systemic arterial hypotension after taking the drug at the recommended dose, which could theoretically limit its neuroprotective role and worsen cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow, particularly when concomitant vasospasm is present. We investigated the association between nimodipine dose changes and clinical outcomes in a consecutive series of 150 patients (mean age, 56 years; 70.7% women) with acute aSAH. We describe the pharmacogenomic relationship of nimodipine dose reduction with clinical outcomes. These results have major implications for future individualized dosing of nimodipine in the era of precision medicine.	557	565	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	arterial
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To examine whether serotonin (5-HT) related genetic variants moderate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) at the radius, lumbar spine (LS) BMD, total body less head (TBLH) bone mineral content (BMC) and markers of bone metabolism (osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX-1], and bone specific alkaline phosphatase to CTX-1 ratio) were examined in an observational study, enrolling 15- to 20-year-old participants, unmedicated or within a month of SSRI initiation. Variants in <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295), <i>HTR1B</i> (rs6296), <i>HTR1D</i> (rs6300), <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311 and rs6314), <i>HTR2B</i> (rs6736017), and the serotonin transporter intron 2 variable number tandem repeat (STin2 VNTR) were genotyped. Linear mixed-effects regression analysis examined associations between SSRI use, genetic variants, and skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> After adjusting for relevant covariates, rs6295 CC and GC genotypes in 262 participants (60% female, mean ± SD age = 18.9 ± 1.6 years) were significantly associated with higher LS BMD compared to the GG genotype. Rs6311 GG SSRI users had greater LS BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.18, <i>p</i> = <0.0001). Female SSRI users with the combination of rs6295 CC+GC and rs6311 GG genotypes had greater LS BMD than female SSRI nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.29, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). SSRI users with the rs6295 GG genotype had higher trabecular BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 3.60, <i>p</i> = 0.05). No significant interactions were found for TBLH BMC or bone turnover markers. After correcting for multiple comparisons, none of the results retained significance. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> In older adolescents and young adults, <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295) and <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311) variants may moderate the effect of SSRIs on BMD. Sex differences may exist and require further examination. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm our preliminary findings. <b><i>Clinical Trial Registration:</i></b> clinicaltrials.gov NCT02147184.	203	226	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	Trabecular bone mineral

In this review, we discuss various pharmacogenomic approaches with special emphasis on heart disease as it relates to diabetes and obesity. Recent information in regard to relevant patents in this topic are also discussed.	1570	1575	ORGAN	heart
Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors tonically inhibit colonic motility and the alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, given intravenously, increased colonic tone in humans. However, the effect of yohimbine on colonic transit in humans is unknown. In this study, 30 healthy volunteers were randomized to yohimbine 16.2 mg p.o. t.i.d. or identical placebo for 7 days. We evaluated gastric emptying, small intestinal, and colonic transit by scinitigraphy, bowel habits, haemodynamics and plasma catecholamines. As cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize yohimbine, P450 genotypes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) were determined in 25 of 30 subjects who consented to genetic studies. The relationship between drug metabolizer status predicted by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and effects of yohmibine were assessed. Compared to placebo, yohimbine increased (P < or = 0.02) diastolic blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline concentrations and maximum tolerated volume during the satiation test [yohimbine (1241 +/- 88, mean +/- SEM) vs placebo (1015 +/- 87), P = 0.054]. However, yohimbine did not affect gastrointestinal transit. Based on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 alleles, seven and 18 subjects were, respectively, extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of yohimbine. Compared to EM, PM of yohimbine had a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline (P = 0.1 for PM vs EM), lower maximum tolerated volumes (1120 +/- 95 vs 1484 + 131 mL, P = 0.02), and faster colonic transit (i.e. GC(24) was 3.0 +/- 0.4 vs 2.1 +/- 0.5, P = 0.1). These data suggest that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genotypes which determine the metabolism of yohimbine may influence its sympathetic and gastrointestinal effects.	375	382	ORGAN	gastric

The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril is hydrolysed to an active metabolite, enalaprilat, in the liver via carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). Previous studies show that variant rs71647871 in the CES1 gene affects the pharmacokinetics of enalapril on liver samples as well as healthy volunteers. This study included 286 Caucasian patients with arterial hypertension who received enalapril. The concentrations of enalapril and enalaprilat were determined before subsequent intake of the drug and 4 h after it with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometric detection. The study included genetic markers as follows: rs2244613, rs71647871 (c.428G>A, p.G143E) and three SNPs indicating the presence of a subtype CES1A1c (rs12149368, rs111604615 and rs201577108). Mean peak and trough enalaprilat concentrations, adjusted by clinical variables, were significantly lower in CES1 rs2244613 heterozygotes (by 16.6% and 19.6%) and in CC homozygotes (by 32.7% and 41.4%) vs. the AA genotype. In CES1A1c homozygotes, adjusted mean enalaprilat concentrations were 75% lower vs. heterozygotes and wild-type (WT) homozygotes. Pharmacogenetic markers of the CES1 gene may be a promising predictor for individualisation when prescribing enalapril.	113	118	ORGAN	liver

Allogenic solid organ transplantation has become the routine procedure in patients with end stage organ disease. Although the transplanted organ compensates deficient body functions, its allogenic nature requires institution of immune tolerance, nowadays provided by immunosuppressive drug administration. Both the safety and efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment depend on many factors, and maintaining levels of immunosuppressants within therapeutic range is the essential target for success in graft function preservation. It is obvious that drug and metabolite concentrations depend on efficiency of individual patient metabolism. Recently, many studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between genetic factors, drug pharmacokinetics and therapy outcome, and interindividual variability apparently can be explained, at least in part, by genetically determined polymorphisms of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, transport proteins and also in some cases, drug targets. This review presents the recent state of knowledge in the field of pharmacogenetics related to solid organ transplantation.	98	103	ORGAN	organ

A postulated role of subcortical neuromodulators is to control brain states. Mechanisms by which different neuromodulators compete or cooperate at various temporal scales remain an open question. We investigated the interaction of acetylcholine (ACh) and oxytocin (OXT) at slow and fast timescales during various brain states. Although these neuromodulators fluctuated in parallel during NREM packets, transitions from NREM to REM were characterized by a surge of ACh but a continued decrease of OXT. OXT signaling lagged behind ACh. High ACh was correlated with population synchrony and gamma oscillations during active waking, whereas minimum ACh predicts sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs). Optogenetic control of ACh and OXT neurons confirmed the active role of these neuromodulators in the observed correlations. Synchronous hippocampal activity consistently reduced OXT activity, whereas inactivation of the lateral septum-hypothalamus path attenuated this effect. Our findings demonstrate how cooperative actions of these neuromodulators allow target circuits to perform specific functions.	63	68	ORGAN	brain

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and heterogeneous disorder characterized by remitting and relapsing periods of activity. Pharmacogenetics refers to the study of the effect of inheritance on individual variation in drug responses. Several drug-related markers in IBD patients have been identified in order to predict the response to medical treatment including biological therapy as well as the reduction of adverse events. In the future, the treatment of IBD should be personalized in its specific profile to provide the most efficacious treatment with lack of adverse events.	13	18	ORGAN	bowel
Effective management of sickle cell pain entails a thorough understanding of its pathophysiology and the pharmacogenomics of the opioids used to manage it. In recent years, there has been significant progress along these two lines. At the pathophysiologic level, there is evidence that the severity and frequency of painful stimuli modulate their transmission at the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This modulation is achieved via two channels: the α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and NMDA receptors. Initially, the AMPA channel controls the transmission of stimuli of mild-moderate severity. Once the AMPA channel reaches its limit of membrane depolarization, the NMDA channel is activated and facilitates the transmission of painful stimuli in a progressive fashion leading to central sensitization and glial activation. At the level of pharmacogenomics, the metabolism of each opioid is patient-specific. Glucuronidation is unique for the metabolism of morphine, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone. The metabolism of all other opioids requires specific Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. The activity of each isoenzyme and the activity of the metabolites of each opioid vary among patients depending on their genetic makeup and coexistent environmental factors such as the use of other medications that may enhance or inhibit the CYP isoenzyme activity.	399	410	ORGAN	spinal cord
Heart failure is a significant medical problem affecting more than five million people in the USA alone. Although clinical trials of pharmacological agents have demonstrated significant reductions in the relative risk of mortality across populations, absolute mortality remains high. In addition, individual variation in response is great. Some of this variation may be explained by genetic polymorphism. In this paper, we review the key studies to date in heart failure pharmacogenetics, setting this against a background of recent progress in the genetics of warfarin metabolism. Several polymorphisms that have supporting molecular and clinical data in the heart failure literature are reviewed, among them the beta1-adrenergic receptor variant Arg389Gly and the angiotensin converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism. These variants and others are responsible for a fraction of the total variation seen in the treatment response to heart failure. With the dawn of the genomic age, further pharmacogenetic and new pharmacogenomic studies will advance our ability to tailor the treatment of heart failure.	0	5	ORGAN	Heart

We systematically collected eligible data to measure the effect of CYP3A5*1 expression on personalized tacrolimus therapy. Six databases were searched for studies on adult liver transplant recipients and donors of liver graft which reported tacrolimus dose requirement, trough blood concentration, and/or concentration/dose (C/D) ratio in expressers and nonexpressers of CYP3A5*1. Eligible data were pooled by meta-analysis. Sixteen observational studies (1309 recipients, 1044 donors of liver graft) were included in the analyses. Tacrolimus C/D ratio was lower, and the dose was higher in recipient expressers of CYP3A5*1 and/or carriers of expresser liver graft at 1-4 weeks and 2-4, 6, and 12 months post-transplantation. Tacrolimus blood concentration was lower at the first two weeks. Pair expressers were affected by about twofold, and the effect was different between ethnic groups. CYP3A5*1 expression in recipients increased tacrolimus required dose by 0.023 at first, 0.022 at third, and 0.012 mg/kg/day at sixth month. Its expression in graft tissue increased tacrolimus required dose by 0.024 at first, 0.035 at third, and 0.032 mg/kg/day at sixth month. Considering CYP3A5*1 polymorphism can be helpful in individualization of tacrolimus efficient dose prior to administration, and it can remove initial high-risk lag time (over/underdose period before reaching target blood level) at first few days post-transplantation.	172	177	ORGAN	liver
The majority of patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas have advanced disease at presentation, with only 20% surviving beyond one year. Even among the 10% to 15% of patients who present with localized disease, only 20% will be alive 5 years post surgical resection. Systemic therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma to date has failed to provide more than a very modest survival benefit for patients with advanced disease. However, the past decade has seen significant advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, culminating in the sequencing of the pancreatic cancer genome. New generations of therapeutic agents targeting key oncogenic cellular signaling pathways are currently under evaluation in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Although thus far only erlotinib has been shown to improve survival when compared to gemcitabine monotherapy, the authors anticipate that further developments in biomarker analysis and pharmacogenomics, along with the identification of new drugs will help maximize the benefit of novel therapeutics by directing effective use in the future. Herein the authors review the evidence to date for the use of novel cytotoxic and molecularly targeted agents in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and discuss key areas for future therapeutic development.	62	70	ORGAN	pancreas
Pharmacogenetics offers a way to personalize medication prescribing for patients. Through the use of genetic tests that identify variations in enzymes important to drug metabolism, PAs can have patients' genetic information before prescribing a medication. This may reduce the risks of adverse reactions and lost treatment time when patients are given drugs to which they are unlikely to respond. Laboratory testing can identify common genetic variants that alter how the body metabolizes drugs. PAs with knowledge of these variants can choose medications that are more personalized and effective for each patient. Clinical pharmacogenetic guidelines are under development and will help providers identify which drugs are most likely to be affected by genetic variations so they can prescribe for patients based on their specific genetic phenotypes.	181	184	ORGAN	PAs
The purpose of this pharmacokinetics (PK) study was to investigate whether different release kinetics from bupropion hydrochloride (HCl) immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (ER) formulations alter its metabolism and to test the hypothesis that the unsuccessful bioequivalence (BE) study of the higher strength (300 mg) of bupropion HCl ER tablets based on the successful BE study of the lower strength (150 mg) was due to metabolic saturation in the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen. A randomized six-way crossover study was conducted in healthy volunteers. During each period, subjects took a single dose of IR (75/100 mg), SR (100/150 mg), or ER (150/300 mg) formulations of bupropion HCl; plasma samples for PK analysis were collected from 0-96 h for all formulations. In addition, each subject's whole blood was collected for the genotyping of various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of bupropion's major metabolic enzymes. The data indicates that the relative bioavailability of the ER formulations was 72.3-78.8% compared with IR 75 mg. No differences were observed for ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) of metabolite to AUC of parent for the three major metabolites. The pharmacogenomics analysis suggested no statistically significant correlation between polymorphisms and PK parameters of the various formulations. Altogether, these data suggested that the different release kinetics of the formulations did not change metabolites-to-parent ratio. Therefore, the differing BE result between the 150 and 300 mg bupropion HCl ER tablets was unlikely due to the metabolic saturation in the GI lumen caused by different release patterns.	720	734	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma samples

Pharmacogenomics is about selecting the "right drug in the right amount for the right patient." In metastatic colorectal cancer, germline pharmacogenomics testing presents a unique opportunity to improve outcomes, since the genes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase metabolizing the chemotherapy drugs, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan are already well known. In a retrospective analysis of the landmark TRIBE clinical trial [(TRIBE - TRIplet plus BEvacizumab multicenter, phase III trial by the Italian Cooperative GONO (Gruppo Oncologico Nord Ovest) group (NCT00719797)], the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was higher in those with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase/UDP-glucuronosyltransferase aberrations and was dose dependent.

Nevertheless, the efficacy of siRNA delivery has, so far, remained a challenging issue. This is due to their easy degradation through the circulation system and the difficulties in the intracellular delivery to specific tissues where they silence the target genes. There have been many efforts to develop suitable, safe and effective siRNA delivery systems in the past decades. These efforts specifically aimed to protect siRNA from serum nucleases and deliver it to an intracellular region in the desired target cells. In this context, one of the new and popular approaches is nanovehicle-mediated siRNA delivery systems.	726	731	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum
Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.	968	974	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma

Genetic factors associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) have been widely studied over the last decade. We examined whether genetic variants previously associated with BMI in the general population are associated with cardiometabolic parameter worsening in the psychiatric population receiving psychotropic drugs, a high-risk group for metabolic disturbances. Classification And Regression Trees (CARTs) were used as a tool capable of describing hierarchical associations, to pinpoint genetic variants best predicting worsening of cardiometabolic parameters (i.e total, HDL and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and blood pressure) following prescription of psychotropic drugs inducing weight gain in a discovery sample of 357 Caucasian patients. Significant findings were tested for replication in a second Caucasian psychiatric sample (n=140). SH2B1 rs3888190C>A was significantly associated with LDL levels in the discovery and in the replication sample, with A-allele carriers having 0.2mmol/l (p=0.005) and 0.36mmol/l (p=0.007) higher LDL levels compared to others, respectively. G-allele carriers of RABEP1 rs1000940A>G had lower fasting glucose levels compared to others in both samples (-0.16mmol/l; p<0.001 and -0.77mmol/l; p=0.03 respectively). The present study is the first to observe such associations in human subjects, which may in part be explained by a high risk towards dyslipidemia and diabetes in psychiatric patients receiving psychotropic treatments compared to population-based individuals. These results may therefore give new insight into the etiology of LDL-cholesterol and glucose regulation in psychiatric patients under psychotropic drug therapy.	666	671	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
To document determinants of O-demethylation in critically ill (pre)term neonates and infants, tramadol (M) and O-demethyl tramadol (M1) concentrations were quantified in eighty-six 24 h urine collections and 168 plasma samples. A significant correlation of urine log M/M1 (0.98, SD 0.66) and plasma log M/M1 (0.78, SD 0.45) with postmenstrual age (PMA) (r = -0.69 and -0.65) was observed. One-way analysis of variance documented a significant decrease in urine log and plasma log M/M1 with increasing CYP2D6 activity score (F value 11.6 and 22.55). PMA and CYP2D6 activity score determined the urine and plasma log M/M1 (R 0.59 and 0.64) in a forward multiple regression model. We therefore conclude that PMA and CYP2D6 polymorphisms determined O-demethylation activity in (pre)term neonates and young infants, illustrating the impact of pharmacogenetics on drug metabolism in neonates although a relevant part of the interindividual varaibility remained unexplained. Besides compound-specific relevance, CYP2D6 iso-enzyme specific data on in vivo ontogeny of O-demethylation can contribute to safer and more effective administration of drugs metabolized by the same route in this population.	292	298	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma

Fluoxetine is one of the most prescribed antidepressants, yet it still faces challenges due to high intersubject variability in patient response. Mainly metabolized by the highly polymorphic gene <i>CYP2D6</i>, important differences in plasma concentrations after the same doses are found among individuals. This study investigated the association of fluoxetine pharmacokinetics (PK) with pharmacogenetic variants. A bioequivalence crossover trial (two sequences, two periods) was conducted with fluoxetine 20 mg capsules, in 24 healthy subjects. Blood samples for fluoxetine determination were collected up to 72 h post-dose. Subjects were genotyped and single nucleotide variants (SNV) were selected using a candidate gene approach, and then associated with the PK parameters. Bioequivalence was confirmed for the test formulation. We found 34 SNV on 10 genes with a quantifiable impact on the PK of fluoxetine in the randomized controlled trial. Out of those, 29 SNVs belong to 7 CYPs (<i>CYP1A2</i>, <i>CYP2B6</i>, <i>CYP2C9</i>, <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i>, <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>), and 5 SNVs to 3 genes impacting the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of fluoxetine (<i>SLC6A4</i>, <i>TPH1</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>). Moreover, decreased/no function SNVs of <i>CYP2D6</i> (rs1065852, rs28371703, rs1135840) and <i>CYP2C19</i> (rs12769205) were confirmed phenotypically. Our research contributes to deepening the catalog of genotype-phenotype associations in pharmacokinetics, aiming to increase pharmacogenomics knowledge for rational treatment schemes of antidepressants.	236	242	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma
The pharmacokinetic variability of nifedipine widely observed in the clinic cannot be fully explained by pharmacogenomics. As a new factor affecting drug metabolism, how the gut microbiota affects the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine needs to be explored. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) have been commonly used in hypertension-related research and served as the experimental groups; Wistar rats were used as control groups. In this study, the bioavailability of nifedipine decreased by 18.62% (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the SHRs compared with the Wistar rats. Changes in microbiota were associated with the difference in pharmacokinetics. The relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides dorei</i> was negatively correlated with AUC<sub>0-t</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.881, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.714, <i>p</i> = 0.047). Analysis of serum bile acid (BA) profiles indicated that glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were significantly increased in the SHRs. Compared with the Wistar rats, the expressions of CYP3A1 and PXR were upregulated and the enzyme activity of CYP3A1 increased in the SHRs. Spearman's rank correlation revealed that <i>Bacteroides stercoris</i> was negatively correlated with GUDCA (<i>r</i> = -0.7126, <i>p</i> = 0.0264) and GCDCA (<i>r</i> = -0.6878, <i>p</i> = 0.0339). Moreover, GUDCA was negatively correlated with <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.556, <i>p</i> = 0.025). In primary rat hepatocytes, GUDCA could induce the expressions of PXR target genes <i>CYP3A1</i> and <i>Mdr1a</i>. Furthermore, antibiotic treatments in SHRs verified the impact of microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Generally, gut microbiota affects the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine through microbial biotransformation or by regulating the enzyme activity of CYP3A1.	855	870	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum bile acid
We systematically collected eligible data to measure the effect of CYP3A5*1 expression on personalized tacrolimus therapy. Six databases were searched for studies on adult liver transplant recipients and donors of liver graft which reported tacrolimus dose requirement, trough blood concentration, and/or concentration/dose (C/D) ratio in expressers and nonexpressers of CYP3A5*1. Eligible data were pooled by meta-analysis. Sixteen observational studies (1309 recipients, 1044 donors of liver graft) were included in the analyses. Tacrolimus C/D ratio was lower, and the dose was higher in recipient expressers of CYP3A5*1 and/or carriers of expresser liver graft at 1-4 weeks and 2-4, 6, and 12 months post-transplantation. Tacrolimus blood concentration was lower at the first two weeks. Pair expressers were affected by about twofold, and the effect was different between ethnic groups. CYP3A5*1 expression in recipients increased tacrolimus required dose by 0.023 at first, 0.022 at third, and 0.012 mg/kg/day at sixth month. Its expression in graft tissue increased tacrolimus required dose by 0.024 at first, 0.035 at third, and 0.032 mg/kg/day at sixth month. Considering CYP3A5*1 polymorphism can be helpful in individualization of tacrolimus efficient dose prior to administration, and it can remove initial high-risk lag time (over/underdose period before reaching target blood level) at first few days post-transplantation.	277	282	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood

The latest consensus has changed <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping among Chinese population, while its impact on metoprolol tolerance and adverse events in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases remains unclear. In this study, we prospectively included elderly patients who started metoprolol treatment for cardiovascular indications. According to the latest consensus on <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype-to-phenotype translation, the patients were categorized as normal, intermediate, or poor metabolizers (NMs, IMs, or PMs, respectively) by detecting the presence of the <i>CYP2D6*1</i>, <i>*2</i>, <i>*5</i>, <i>*10</i>, and <i>*14</i>. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between the <i>CYP2D6</i> phenotype and incidence of adverse events, which were assessed over a 12-week period. In this study, there were 651 (62.7%) NMs, 385 (37.1%) IMs, and 3 (0.3%) PMs. After 12 weeks of follow-up, compared with NMs, IMs had the lower maintenance dose [50.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day vs. 25.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day, <i>p</i> < 0.001] and lower weight-adjusted maintenance doses (0.52 ± 0.25 mg/day/kg vs. 0.42 ± 0.22 mg/day/kg, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and had higher incidence of postural hypotension (6.0% vs. 10.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.006), bradycardia (21.5% vs. 28.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.011), asystole (0.8% vs. 3.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and syncope (2.0% vs. 6.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.001). In logistic regression model, the overall incidence of adverse events was 1.37-fold larger in IMs than in NMs (odds ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.79, <i>p</i> = 0.021). We conclude that IMs have lower tolerance and higher incidence of metoprolol-related adverse events than NMs in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases. <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping is justifiable in elderly patients to minimize the risk of adverse events and ensure the benefits of metoprolol.	177	191	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key membrane-embedded receptor proteins, with critical roles in cellular signal transduction. In the era of precision medicine, understanding the role of natural variants on GPCR function is critical, especially from a pharmacogenomics viewpoint. Studies involved in mapping variants to GPCR structures are briefly reviewed here. The endocannabinoid system involving the central nervous system (CNS), the human cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), is an important drug target and its variability has implications for disease susceptibility and altered drug and pain response. We have carried out a computational study to map deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) to CB1. CB1 mutations were computationally evaluated from neutral to deleterious, and the top twelve deleterious mutations, with structural information, were found to be either close to the ligand binding region or the G-protein binding site. We have mapped these to the active and inactive CB1 X-ray crystallographic structures to correlate variants with available phenotypic information. We have also carried out molecular dynamics simulations to functionally characterize four selected mutants.	411	433	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system

One of the unsolved mysteries of medicine is how do volatile anesthetics (VAs) cause a patient to reversibly lose consciousness. In addition, identifying mechanisms for the collateral effects of VAs, including anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (AiN) and anesthetic preconditioning (AP), has proven challenging. Multiple classes of molecules (lipids, proteins, and water) have been considered as potential VA targets, but recently proteins have received the most attention. Studies targeting neuronal receptors or ion channels had limited success in identifying the critical targets of VAs mediating either the phenotype of "anesthesia" or their collateral effects. Recent studies in both nematodes and fruit flies may provide a paradigm shift by suggesting that mitochondria may harbor the upstream molecular switch activating both primary and collateral effects. The disruption of a specific step of electron transfer within the mitochondrion causes hypersensitivity to VAs, from nematodes to <i>Drosophila</i> and to humans, while also modulating the sensitivity to collateral effects. The downstream effects from mitochondrial inhibition are potentially legion, but inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter cycling appears to be specifically sensitive to the mitochondrial effects. These findings are perhaps of even broader interest since two recent reports indicate that mitochondrial damage may well underlie neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of VAs in the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, important to understand how anesthetics interact with mitochondria to affect CNS function, not just for the desired facets of general anesthesia but also for significant collateral effects, both harmful and beneficial. A tantalizing possibility exists that both the primary (anesthesia) and secondary (AiN, AP) mechanisms may at least partially overlap in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).	1469	1491	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system

In addition, identifying mechanisms for the collateral effects of VAs, including anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (AiN) and anesthetic preconditioning (AP), has proven challenging. Multiple classes of molecules (lipids, proteins, and water) have been considered as potential VA targets, but recently proteins have received the most attention. Studies targeting neuronal receptors or ion channels had limited success in identifying the critical targets of VAs mediating either the phenotype of "anesthesia" or their collateral effects. Recent studies in both nematodes and fruit flies may provide a paradigm shift by suggesting that mitochondria may harbor the upstream molecular switch activating both primary and collateral effects. The disruption of a specific step of electron transfer within the mitochondrion causes hypersensitivity to VAs, from nematodes to <i>Drosophila</i> and to humans, while also modulating the sensitivity to collateral effects. The downstream effects from mitochondrial inhibition are potentially legion, but inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter cycling appears to be specifically sensitive to the mitochondrial effects. These findings are perhaps of even broader interest since two recent reports indicate that mitochondrial damage may well underlie neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of VAs in the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, important to understand how anesthetics interact with mitochondria to affect CNS function, not just for the desired facets of general anesthesia but also for significant collateral effects, both harmful and beneficial. A tantalizing possibility exists that both the primary (anesthesia) and secondary (AiN, AP) mechanisms may at least partially overlap in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).	1594	1597	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS
Although statins are effective in treating high cholesterol, adverse effects do occur with their use. Efficacy and tolerability vary among statins in different ethnic groups. Indigenous Australians have a high risk for cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Prescribing statins to Indigenous Australians with multi-morbidity requires different strategies to increase efficacy and reduce their toxicity. Previous studies have reported that Indigenous Australians are more susceptible to severe statin-induced myopathies. However, there is a lack of evidence in the underlying genetic factors in this population. This review aims to identify: inter-ethnic differences in the efficacy and safety of statins; major contributing factors accounting for any identified differences; and provide an overview of statin-induced adverse effects in Indigenous Australians.	219	233	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affects patient outcomes and satisfaction. New research has centered on evaluation of post-discharge and opioid-related nausea and vomiting. Mechanical and drug effects stimulate the release of central nervous system neurotransmitters acting at receptors in the vomiting center, area postrema, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Brain surgery has allowed insight into specific central emetogenic areas. Stimuli from peripheral organs act through afferent vagus neurons and a parasympathetic response causing nausea and vomiting. Opioids stimulate mu receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and cholinergic receptors in the vestibular system. Opioids also affect gastrointestinal (GI) tract mechanics by decreasing gastric emptying, intestinal motility, GI peristalsis, and secretions. Regional blocks and non-opioid multimodal analgesia help to decrease nausea and vomiting. Patient, surgery, and anesthesia factors contribute to risk and degree of PONV experienced. Pharmacogenetics plays a role in gene typing as antiemetic medication metabolism results in varying drug effectiveness. Risk scoring systems are available. Individualized multimodal plans can be designed as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol.	668	678	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	vestibular
Arterial thrombosis is a major component of vascular disease, especially myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Current anti-thrombotic therapies such as warfarin and clopidogrel are effective in inhibiting cardiovascular events; however, there is great inter-individual variability in response to these medications. In recent years, it has been recognized that genetic factors play a significant role in drug response, and, subsequently, common variants in genes responsible for metabolism and drug action have been identified. These discoveries along with new diagnostic targets and therapeutic strategies hold promise for more effective individualized anti-coagulation and anti-platelet therapy.	207	221	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis (CRSwNP) affects the quality of life of patients suffering from it. The search for a suitable biomarker has been conducted over the last decades. Interleukin 5 receptor subunit alpha (IL-5Rα) involves the activation, maintenance, and survival of eosinophils, which are highly tied to chronic inflammatory processes of the airways, like asthma or CRSwNP. In this study, we evaluate the utility of <i>IL5RA</i> as a genetic biomarker in CRSwNP. <i>IL5RA</i> mRNA expression level was analyzed in different groups of patients by performing qPCR assays. A significant increase in <i>IL5RA</i> expression was observed in CRSwNP patients, especially those with asthma and atopy. We found differences in expression levels when comparing groups with or without polyposis or asthma, as well as some atypical cases related to eosinophil levels. That opens a path to future studies to further characterize groups of patients with common features in the context of pharmacogenetics and in an era towards developing a more precise personalized treatment with IL-5Rα as a therapeutic target for CRSwNP.	28	33	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	Nasal
Endothelial nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator and impairment of its generation brought about by gene polymorphism is considered a major predictor for several diseases. A single nucleotide polymorphism G894T within exon 7 of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS-7) gene, resulting in a replacement of glutamic acid by aspartic acid, has been studied as a putative candidate gene for cardiovascular diseases. The pattern of eNOS-7 Glu298Asp variant in the Indian population is poorly known. The present study was planned to determine the prevalence of the variant of this gene among tea garden community in Assam, North-East India with high prevalence of hypertension.	388	402	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To examine whether serotonin (5-HT) related genetic variants moderate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) at the radius, lumbar spine (LS) BMD, total body less head (TBLH) bone mineral content (BMC) and markers of bone metabolism (osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX-1], and bone specific alkaline phosphatase to CTX-1 ratio) were examined in an observational study, enrolling 15- to 20-year-old participants, unmedicated or within a month of SSRI initiation. Variants in <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295), <i>HTR1B</i> (rs6296), <i>HTR1D</i> (rs6300), <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311 and rs6314), <i>HTR2B</i> (rs6736017), and the serotonin transporter intron 2 variable number tandem repeat (STin2 VNTR) were genotyped. Linear mixed-effects regression analysis examined associations between SSRI use, genetic variants, and skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> After adjusting for relevant covariates, rs6295 CC and GC genotypes in 262 participants (60% female, mean ± SD age = 18.9 ± 1.6 years) were significantly associated with higher LS BMD compared to the GG genotype. Rs6311 GG SSRI users had greater LS BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.18, <i>p</i> = <0.0001). Female SSRI users with the combination of rs6295 CC+GC and rs6311 GG genotypes had greater LS BMD than female SSRI nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.29, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). SSRI users with the rs6295 GG genotype had higher trabecular BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 3.60, <i>p</i> = 0.05). No significant interactions were found for TBLH BMC or bone turnover markers. After correcting for multiple comparisons, none of the results retained significance. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> In older adolescents and young adults, <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295) and <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311) variants may moderate the effect of SSRIs on BMD. Sex differences may exist and require further examination. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm our preliminary findings. <b><i>Clinical Trial Registration:</i></b> clinicaltrials.gov NCT02147184.	329	332	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	BMC
In spite of promising preclinical results there is a decreasing number of new registered medications in major depression. The main reason behind this fact is the lack of confirmation in clinical studies for the assumed, and in animals confirmed, therapeutic results. This suggests low predictive value of animal studies for central nervous system disorders. One solution for identifying new possible targets is the application of genetics and genomics, which may pinpoint new targets based on the effect of genetic variants in humans. The present review summarizes such research focusing on depression and its therapy. The inconsistency between most genetic studies in depression suggests, first of all, a significant role of environmental stress. Furthermore, effect of individual genes and polymorphisms is weak, therefore gene x gene interactions or complete biochemical pathways should be analyzed. Even genes encoding target proteins of currently used antidepressants remain non-significant in genome-wide case control investigations suggesting no main effect in depression, but rather an interaction with stress. The few significant genes in GWASs are related to neurogenesis, neuronal synapse, cell contact and DNA transcription and as being nonspecific for depression are difficult to harvest pharmacologically. Most candidate genes in replicable gene x environment interactions, on the other hand, are connected to the regulation of stress and the HPA axis and thus could serve as drug targets for depression subgroups characterized by stress-sensitivity and anxiety while other risk polymorphisms such as those related to prominent cognitive symptoms in depression may help to identify additional subgroups and their distinct treatment. Until these new targets find their way into therapy, the optimization of current medications can be approached by pharmacogenomics, where metabolizing enzyme polymorphisms remain prominent determinants of therapeutic success.	324	346	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system
Agonists and antagonists of G protein-coupled receptors are important drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but the therapeutic response of any given patient remains difficult to predict because of large interindividual variability. Among the factors potentially contributing to such variability, we have reviewed the evidence for a role of pharmacodynamic pharmacogenetics (i.e., polymorphisms in the cognate receptors for such drugs as well as other proteins potentially modifying their action). Based upon the availability of data and the prevalence of use, we have focused on ligands at adrenergic and angiotensin II receptors (including the indirectly acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). The vast majority of gene polymorphisms reviewed here have shown only inconsistent effects on drug action, which does not make these polymorphisms useful genetic markers to predict treatment responses. We conclude that considerable additional research, partly involving other types of study than those available now, will be necessary to allow a definitive judgment whether pharmacodynamic pharmacogenetic markers are useful in an individualized approach to cardiovascular therapy. Moreover, we predict that even such additional research will result in only few cases where the promise of tailored treatment can be fulfilled; however, some of these few cases may be of major clinical relevance.	97	111	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular

Efavirenz (EFV) is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor commonly used as first-line therapy in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with a narrow therapeutic range and a high between-subject variability which can lead to central nervous system toxicity or therapeutic failure. To characterize the sources of variability and better predict EFV steady-state plasma concentrations, a population pharmacokinetic model was developed from 96 HIV-positive individuals, using a nonlinear mixed-effect method with Monolix® software. A one-compartment with first-order absorption and elimination model adequately described the data. To explain between-subject variability, demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters, hepatitis C virus-HIV coinfection, and genetic polymorphisms were tested. A combination of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs2279343 and rs3745274, both in the CYP2B6 gene, were the only covariates influencing clearance, included in the final model. Oral clearance was estimated to be 19.6 L/h, 14.15 L/h, and 6.08 L/h for wild-type, heterozygous mutated and homozygous mutated individuals, respectively. These results are in accordance with the current knowledge of EFV metabolism and also suggest that in homozygous mutated individuals, a dose adjustment is necessary. Hepatitis C virus-HIV coinfection does not seem to be a predictive indicator of EFV pharmacokinetic disposition.	248	270	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system
Sensory systems sequentially extract increasingly complex features. ON and OFF pathways, for example, encode increases or decreases of a stimulus from a common input. This ON/OFF pathway split is thought to occur at individual synaptic connections through a sign-inverting synapse in one of the pathways. Here, we show that ON selectivity is a multisynaptic process in the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system. A pharmacogenetics approach demonstrates that both glutamatergic inhibition through GluClα and GABAergic inhibition through Rdl mediate ON responses. Although neurons postsynaptic to the glutamatergic ON pathway input L1 lose all responses in <i>GluClα</i> mutants, they are resistant to a cell-type-specific loss of <i>GluClα</i>. This shows that ON selectivity is distributed across multiple synapses, and raises the possibility that cell-type-specific manipulations might reveal similar strategies in other sensory systems. Thus, sensory coding is more distributed than predicted by simple circuit motifs, allowing for robust neural processing.	227	235	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	synaptic
Warfarin is a cornerstone of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Anticoagulation with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation is over twice as effective in secondary prevention of stroke as any other tested alternatives, including all other antithrombotic drugs or surgical interventions. General belief is that warfarin is capable of preventing 20 ischemic strokes for every hemorrhagic one it causes. However, warfarin is one of the most feared agents as a result of its woeful safety profile and difficulties in maintaining the proper daily dose. Recent research in pharmacogenetics predominantly focused on elucidating the influence of individual genetic predispositions to administered warfarin. Although the incorporation of genotype information improves the accuracy of adequate dose prediction, an improvement in anticoagulation control or a reduction in hemorrhagic complications has not been yet convincingly demonstrated. It is clear that identifying an individual patient's risk for hemorrhage on warfarin will require more broad clinical and genetic studies. Future research focused on patients with stroke should concentrate on defining the possible differences, especially focusing on predicting bleeding events in general and intracranial hemorrhages in particular. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing evidence about pharmacogenetics of warfarin in general, especially focusing on stroke prevention.	29	33	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
Obesity is a global epidemic that is a leading cause of preventable death. In addition to lifestyle modification, there are numerous obesity treatments for clinicians to consider, including medications. Lorcaserin immediate release/extended release (IR/XR) is a US Food and Drug Administration approved medication for overweight and obese patients to be used with lifestyle modifications. Lorcaserin is thought to reduce weight by targeting the serotonin (5HT<sub>2c</sub>) system to induce satiety. Lorcaserin IR has been shown to be effective in reducing weight in overweight (body mass index [BMI] > 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obese (BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participants in three large Phase III trials. In addition, lorcaserin has been shown to reduce post-cessation weight gain and improved smoking cessation in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. A recent meta-analysis suggested in overweight diabetic patients lorcaserin may be added to first-line oral hypoglycemic medications to enhance reduction in glycated hemoglobin. Lorcaserin is generally well tolerated with the most common side effect being headache, which is typically self-limiting. Lorcaserin XR (once daily) was recently approved and has been shown to be bioequivalent to lorcaserin IR (twice daily) in a pivotal study. Lorcaserin XRs, main advantage over the IR formulation is the once daily dosing regimen, which likely would lead to improved adherence and thus improved clinical effectiveness. The present review will evaluate the lorcaserin clinical studies (obesity, diabetes, and addiction), XR bioequivalence studies, pharmacogenomics of the serotonin (5HT<sub>2c</sub>) system, and adherence data in once daily versus twice daily medications.	960	964	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors tonically inhibit colonic motility and the alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, given intravenously, increased colonic tone in humans. However, the effect of yohimbine on colonic transit in humans is unknown. In this study, 30 healthy volunteers were randomized to yohimbine 16.2 mg p.o. t.i.d. or identical placebo for 7 days. We evaluated gastric emptying, small intestinal, and colonic transit by scinitigraphy, bowel habits, haemodynamics and plasma catecholamines. As cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize yohimbine, P450 genotypes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) were determined in 25 of 30 subjects who consented to genetic studies. The relationship between drug metabolizer status predicted by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and effects of yohmibine were assessed. Compared to placebo, yohimbine increased (P < or = 0.02) diastolic blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline concentrations and maximum tolerated volume during the satiation test [yohimbine (1241 +/- 88, mean +/- SEM) vs placebo (1015 +/- 87), P = 0.054]. However, yohimbine did not affect gastrointestinal transit. Based on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 alleles, seven and 18 subjects were, respectively, extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of yohimbine. Compared to EM, PM of yohimbine had a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline (P = 0.1 for PM vs EM), lower maximum tolerated volumes (1120 +/- 95 vs 1484 + 131 mL, P = 0.02), and faster colonic transit (i.e. GC(24) was 3.0 +/- 0.4 vs 2.1 +/- 0.5, P = 0.1). These data suggest that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genotypes which determine the metabolism of yohimbine may influence its sympathetic and gastrointestinal effects.	145	152	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	colonic

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) models can serve as a powerful framework for predicting the influence as well as the interaction of formulation, genetic polymorphism and co-medication on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug substances. In this study, flurbiprofen, a potent non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, was chosen as a model drug. Flurbiprofen has absolute bioavailability of ~95% and linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 50-300 mg. Its absorption is considered variable and complex, often associated with double peak phenomena, and its pharmacokinetics are characterized by high inter-subject variability, mainly due to its metabolism by the polymorphic CYP2C9 (fmCYP2C9 ≥ 0.71). In this study, by leveraging <i>in vitro, in silico</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data, an integrated PBPK/PD model with mechanistic absorption was developed and evaluated against clinical data from PK, PD, drug-drug and gene-drug interaction studies. The PBPK model successfully predicted (within 2-fold) 36 out of 38 observed concentration-time profiles of flurbiprofen as well as the CYP2C9 genetic effects after administration of different intravenous and oral dosage forms over a dose range of 40-300 mg in both Caucasian and Chinese healthy volunteers. All model predictions for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub> and CL/F were within two-fold of their respective mean or geometric mean values, while 90% of the predictions of C<sub>max</sub>, 81% of the predictions of AUC<sub>inf</sub> and 74% of the predictions of Cl/F were within 1.25 fold. In addition, the drug-drug and drug-gene interactions were predicted within 1.5-fold of the observed interaction ratios (AUC, C<sub>max</sub> ratios). The validated PBPK model was further expanded by linking it to an inhibitory <i>E<sub>max</sub></i> model describing the analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen and applying it to explore the effect of formulation and genetic polymorphisms on the onset and duration of pain relief. This comprehensive PBPK/PD analysis, along with a detailed translational biopharmaceutic framework including appropriately designed biorelevant <i>in vitro</i> experiments and <i>in vitro-in vivo</i> extrapolation, provided mechanistic insight on the impact of formulation and genetic variations, two major determinants of the population variability, on the PK/PD of flurbiprofen. Clinically relevant specifications and potential dose adjustments were also proposed. Overall, the present work highlights the value of a translational PBPK/PD approach, tailored to target populations and genotypes, as an approach towards achieving personalized medicine.	1194	1198	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, consuming a significant proportion of public health spending. Oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) are the frontline treatment approaches after lifestyle changes. However, huge interindividual variation in response to OHAs results in unnecessary treatment failure. In addition to nongenetic factors, genetic factors are thought to contribute to much of such variability, highlighting the importance of the potential of pharmacogenetics to improve therapeutic outcome. Despite the presence of conflicting results, significant progress has been made in an effort to identify the genetic markers associated with pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and ultimately therapeutic response and/or adverse outcomes to OHAs. As such, this article presents a comprehensive review of current knowledge on pharmacogenetics of OHAs and provides insights into knowledge gaps and future directions.	135	139	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	Oral
The pharmacokinetic variability of nifedipine widely observed in the clinic cannot be fully explained by pharmacogenomics. As a new factor affecting drug metabolism, how the gut microbiota affects the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine needs to be explored. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) have been commonly used in hypertension-related research and served as the experimental groups; Wistar rats were used as control groups. In this study, the bioavailability of nifedipine decreased by 18.62% (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the SHRs compared with the Wistar rats. Changes in microbiota were associated with the difference in pharmacokinetics. The relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides dorei</i> was negatively correlated with AUC<sub>0-t</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.881, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.714, <i>p</i> = 0.047). Analysis of serum bile acid (BA) profiles indicated that glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were significantly increased in the SHRs. Compared with the Wistar rats, the expressions of CYP3A1 and PXR were upregulated and the enzyme activity of CYP3A1 increased in the SHRs. Spearman's rank correlation revealed that <i>Bacteroides stercoris</i> was negatively correlated with GUDCA (<i>r</i> = -0.7126, <i>p</i> = 0.0264) and GCDCA (<i>r</i> = -0.6878, <i>p</i> = 0.0339). Moreover, GUDCA was negatively correlated with <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.556, <i>p</i> = 0.025). In primary rat hepatocytes, GUDCA could induce the expressions of PXR target genes <i>CYP3A1</i> and <i>Mdr1a</i>. Furthermore, antibiotic treatments in SHRs verified the impact of microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Generally, gut microbiota affects the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine through microbial biotransformation or by regulating the enzyme activity of CYP3A1.	174	177	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	gut

Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active drug moiety of mycophenolate, is a potent immunosuppressant agent, which is increasingly being used in the treatment of patients with various autoimmune diseases. An understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate in this population should assist the clinician with rational dosage decisions. This review aims to provide an overview of the published literature on the clinical pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate in autoimmune disease and a briefer summary of current pharmacodynamic knowledge, and to identify areas of potential future research in this field. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE databases as well as bibliographies of relevant articles and 'on-line early' pages of key journals. Twenty-six pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies of mycophenolate in people with autoimmune disease were identified and appraised. Twenty-two of these studies used non-compartmental analysis techniques and four used population modelling methods to estimate mycophenolate pharmacokinetic parameters. Seven studies linked mycophenolate exposure to treatment outcomes. Only four studies measured free (unbound) as well as total mycophenolate exposure and only two studies characterised MPA disposition following enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) administration. Across all studies MPA displayed erratic and complex pharmacokinetics with substantial between-subject variability. Based on total drug measurement, the dose-normalised MPA area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 12 h post-dose (AUC12) varied at least five- to ten-fold between subjects. Typical values for apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of MPA during nonlinear mixed-effects modelling ranged from 8.3 to 25.3 L/h. Patient renal function, serum albumin levels, sex, ethnicity, food intake, concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as antacids, metal-containing medications and proton pump inhibitors and polymorphisms in genes encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase were identified in some studies as having a significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate. Typical MPA CL/F values in autoimmune disease patients were generally slightly lower than values published previously in population pharmacokinetic studies involving renal allograft recipients, possibly because of usage of ciclosporin, poorer renal function or lower serum albumin levels in the renal transplant cohort. In a single crossover study involving ten subjects only, significantly higher MPA AUC12 and maximum MPA concentration (C max) and lower MPA CL/F were reported following EC-MPS administration compared to mycophenolate mofetil administration. MPA exposure correlated well with treatment efficacy in patients with autoimmune disease (response to treatment, active disease and disease markers); however the relationship between MPA exposure and adverse events (infectious episodes, haematological toxicity and gastrointestinal symptoms) was unclear. Further investigation is required in autoimmune diseases such as chronic plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis and following EC-MPS administration. The extent of within-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate is largely unknown and potential covariate influences need to be confirmed in studies with large subject numbers. A relationship between MPA and MPA metabolite exposure and toxicity needs to be established. The contribution of pharmacogenetics to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate warrants further investigation, as does the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring. Dosing to achieve a target MPA AUC12 >35 mg·h/L is likely to lead to better efficacy outcomes in patients with autoimmune disease (rather than just giving standard doses, which lead to a wide range of exposures). However, the relationship between mycophenolate exposure and toxicity requires further investigation to determine the upper end of a target AUC range.	1692	1696	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
Variable phenotypes of androgen insensitivity exist in humans, mainly owing to defective, mutated androgen receptors. A more subtle modulation of androgen effects is related to the CAG repeat polymorphism ([CAG]n) in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene, in vitro, transcription of androgen-dependent target genes is attenuated with increasing length of triplets. As a clinical entity, the CAG repeat polymorphism can relate to variations of androgenicity in (apparently) eugonadal men in various tissues and psychological traits, the longer the (CAG)n, the less prominent the androgen effect when individuals with similar testosterone concentrations are compared. A strictly defined threshold to hypogonadism is likely to be replaced by a continuum spanned by genetics as well as symptom specificity. In addition, effects of externally applied testosterone can be markedly influenced by the (CAG)n and respective pharmacogenetic implications are likely influence indications as well as modalities of testosterone treatment of hypogonadal men.	1027	1042	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	hypogonadal men
In the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) treatment is the first line treatment after lifestyle measures fail. Two major groups of OAD are used in clinical practice--insulin secretagogues and insulin sensitisers. Sulphonyluea (SU) derivatives are insulin secretagogues and stimulate insulin secretion by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Genes KCNJ11 and ABCC8 encode potassium channel proteins. KCNJ11 gene Glu23Lys polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of SU secondary failure, while Ser1369Ala polymorphism of ABCC8 gene had influence antidiabetic efficacy of SU drug gliclazide. In addition, the polymorphism of TCF7L2 gene, which has the strongest association with T2D, also influenced secondary SU drug failure. Insulin sensitisers include both metformin and glitazones. Some drug-genotype associations were observed for metformin in patients with T2D. Several genes influenced the effect of glitazone treatment. Rosiglitazone was more effective in diabetes control in carriers of Prol2Ala polymorphism of PPARG gene encoding the PPARg-receptor--the target of this drug. Rosiglitazone treatment had less effect on glycemic control and adiponectin increase in T2D patients with GG-genotypes of adiponectin (APM1) polymorphism. Pioglitazone treatment had smaller effect on glycemic control in patients with LPL Ser447X polymorphism. Identification of drug-genotype interactions in pharmacogenetic studies of the OAD treatment might have clinical implications in the near future resulting in selection of more specific "patient-tailored therapy" in T2D (Tab. 1, Ref. 58).	56	60	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
<b>Aim:</b> Pharmacogenomics (PGx) tests are performed on whole-blood or saliva specimens. In patients with a transplanted liver, PGx results may be discordant with hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme activity. We evaluate the incidence and impact of PGx testing in liver transplant recipients, detail potential errors and describe clinical decision support (CDS) solution implemented. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A retrospective cohort study of liver transplant recipients at Mayo Clinic who underwent PGx testing between 1 January 1996 and 7 October 2019 were characterized. Impact of a CDS solution was evaluated. <b>Results:</b> There were 129 PGx tests in 117 patients. PGx testing incidence increased before (per year incidence rate ratio = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.20-1.74, p < 0.001) and after transplant (incidence rate ratio = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.27-1.72, p < 0.001). Three erroneous PGx tests were avoided 6 months following CDS implementation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Incidence of PGx testing in liver transplant recipients is increasing, leading to erroneous therapeutic decisions. CDS interventions and education are needed to prevent errors.	73	79	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	saliva
Pharmacogenetic testing of drug metabolizing enzyme polymorphisms provides an important tool to improve prescribing decisions, avoiding therapeutic failure and adverse drug reactions. Cytochrome P450 2D6 isoform plays an important role in the metabolism of about 20%-25% of widely used clinical drugs. Interethnic differences in allele frequency distribution of the CYP2D6 gene are well established, but interethnic admixture, introducing variations in population ancestry and resulting in distinct levels of population structure, should be acknowledged in pharmacogenomic studies to avoid inappropriate extrapolation of CYP2D6 data. The aim of the present research was to characterize CYP2D6 polymorphism in a random sample of 122 natives and 175 immigrants from Africa, Asia, and South America living in the Emilia-Romagna region (Italy), considering the present scenario of immigration and back migration events, which is a source of admixture. The results are today consistent with the known interethnic genetic variation, but the observed significant divergence between natives and Africans or South-East Asians predicts that admixture will reshape the population structure and the native metabolic ratio curve requiring, for drug prescription and pharmacogenetics studies, an interdisciplinary approach applied in an appropriate biogeographical and anthropological frame.	893	897	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	back
<i>Background and</i> <i>Objectives</i>: Codeine requires biotransformation by the <i>CYP2D6</i> enzyme, encoded by the polymorphic <i>CYP2D6</i> gene, to morphine for therapeutic efficacy. CYP2D6 phenotypes of poor, intermediate, and ultra-rapid metabolisers are at risk of codeine non-response and adverse drug reactions due to altered CYP2D6 function. The aim of this study was to determine whether genotype, inferred phenotype, and urinary and oral fluid codeine O-demethylation metabolites could predict codeine non-response following a short course of codeine. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: There were 131 Caucasians with persistent pain enrolled. Baseline assessments were recorded, prohibited medications ceased, and DNA sampling completed before commencing codeine 30 mg QDS for 5 days. Day 4 urine samples were collected 1-2 h post morning dose for codeine O-demethylation metabolites analysis. Final pain assessments were conducted on day 5. <i>Results</i>: None of the poor, intermediate, ultra-rapid metabolisers and only 24.5% of normal metabolisers responded to codeine. A simple scoring system to predict analgesic response from day 4 urinary metabolites was devised with overall prediction success of 79% (sensitivity 0.8, specificity 0.78) for morphine and 79% (sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.83) for morphine:creatinine ratio. <i>Conclusions</i>: In conclusion, this study provides tentative evidence that day 4 urinary codeine O-demethylation metabolites could predict non-response following a short course of codeine and could be utilised in the clinical assessment of codeine response at the point of care to improve analgesic efficacy and safety in codeine therapy. We offer a scoring system to predict codeine response from urinary morphine and urinary morphine:creatinine ratio collected on the morning of day 4 of codeine 30 mg QDS, but this requires validation before it could be considered for use to assess codeine response in clinical practice.	1432	1447	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	urinary codeine

Alopecia areata, alopecia totalis, and alopecia universalis likely represent a constellation of related diseases with similar, yet distinct heritability markers. There is currently no known curative therapy that works universally for all patients. Pharmacogenomic research enables the pharmaceutical industry to understand variability of patient responses to drugs during clinical drug development and during post-marketing surveillance. Understanding the genetic basis for patient response/non-response can enable the development of individualized therapies for those patients with an inherited basis for altered response to drug therapy. There are multiple examples of drugs that now contain a recommendation for genetic testing before dosing in their drug labels, directing clinicians to obtain genetic information for each individual patient in order to help direct drug therapy.	39	59	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	alopecia universalis

Warfarin is a cornerstone of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Anticoagulation with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation is over twice as effective in secondary prevention of stroke as any other tested alternatives, including all other antithrombotic drugs or surgical interventions. General belief is that warfarin is capable of preventing 20 ischemic strokes for every hemorrhagic one it causes. However, warfarin is one of the most feared agents as a result of its woeful safety profile and difficulties in maintaining the proper daily dose. Recent research in pharmacogenetics predominantly focused on elucidating the influence of individual genetic predispositions to administered warfarin. Although the incorporation of genotype information improves the accuracy of adequate dose prediction, an improvement in anticoagulation control or a reduction in hemorrhagic complications has not been yet convincingly demonstrated. It is clear that identifying an individual patient's risk for hemorrhage on warfarin will require more broad clinical and genetic studies. Future research focused on patients with stroke should concentrate on defining the possible differences, especially focusing on predicting bleeding events in general and intracranial hemorrhages in particular. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing evidence about pharmacogenetics of warfarin in general, especially focusing on stroke prevention.	1256	1268	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	intracranial
Oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy has been the main treatment approach for stroke prevention for decades. Warfarin is the most widely prescribed OAC in the United States, but is difficult to manage due to variability in dose requirements across individuals. Pharmacogenomics may mitigate risk concerns related to warfarin use by fostering the opportunity to facilitate individualized medicine approaches to warfarin treatment (e.g., genome-guided dosing). While various economic evaluations exist examining the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics testing for warfarin, few observational studies exist to support these studies, with even fewer using genotype as the main exposure of interest. We examined a cohort of individuals initiating warfarin therapy between 2004 and 2017 and examined bleeding and cost outcomes for the year following initiation using Mayo Clinic's billing and administrative data, as well the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cost Data Warehouse. Analyses included descriptive summaries, comparison of characteristics across exposure groups, reporting of crude outcomes, and multivariate analyses. We included N = 1,143 patients for analyses. Just over a third of our study population (34.9%) carried a warfarin-sensitive phenotype. Sensitive individuals differed in their baseline characteristics by being of older age and having a higher number of comorbid conditions; myocardial infarction, diabetes, and cancer in particular. The occurrence of bleeding events was not significantly different across exposure groups. No significant differences across exposure groups existed in either the likelihood of incurring all-cause healthcare costs or in the magnitude of those costs. Warfarin-sensitive individuals were no more likely to utilize cardiovascular-related healthcare services; however, they had lower total and inpatient cardiovascular-related costs compared to warfarin-insensitive patients. No significant differences existed in any other categories of costs. We found limited evidence that warfarin-sensitive individuals have different healthcare spending than warfarin-insensitive individuals. Additional real-world studies are needed to support the traditional economic evaluations currently existing in the literature.	0	18	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Oral anticoagulant
Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors tonically inhibit colonic motility and the alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, given intravenously, increased colonic tone in humans. However, the effect of yohimbine on colonic transit in humans is unknown. In this study, 30 healthy volunteers were randomized to yohimbine 16.2 mg p.o. t.i.d. or identical placebo for 7 days. We evaluated gastric emptying, small intestinal, and colonic transit by scinitigraphy, bowel habits, haemodynamics and plasma catecholamines. As cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize yohimbine, P450 genotypes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) were determined in 25 of 30 subjects who consented to genetic studies. The relationship between drug metabolizer status predicted by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and effects of yohmibine were assessed. Compared to placebo, yohimbine increased (P < or = 0.02) diastolic blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline concentrations and maximum tolerated volume during the satiation test [yohimbine (1241 +/- 88, mean +/- SEM) vs placebo (1015 +/- 87), P = 0.054]. However, yohimbine did not affect gastrointestinal transit. Based on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 alleles, seven and 18 subjects were, respectively, extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of yohimbine. Compared to EM, PM of yohimbine had a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline (P = 0.1 for PM vs EM), lower maximum tolerated volumes (1120 +/- 95 vs 1484 + 131 mL, P = 0.02), and faster colonic transit (i.e. GC(24) was 3.0 +/- 0.4 vs 2.1 +/- 0.5, P = 0.1). These data suggest that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genotypes which determine the metabolism of yohimbine may influence its sympathetic and gastrointestinal effects.	47	54	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	colonic

The pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus can be partly explained by CYP3A5 activity. Our objective was to evaluate a tacrolimus sparing policy on renal graft outcome according to <i>CYP3A5</i> 6986A>G genetic polymorphism. This retrospective study included 1114 recipients with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Genotyping of the 6986A>G allelic variant corresponding to <i>CYP3A5*3</i> was systematically performed. One year after transplantation, tacrolimus blood trough concentration (C0) target range was 5-7 ng/mL. However, daily dose was capped to 0.10 mg/kg/day regardless of the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype. A total 208 <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients were included. Despite a higher daily dose, <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients exhibited lower C0 during follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of <i>CYP3A5*1</i>/- genotype (HR = 0.70, 0.46-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.10) on patient-graft survival. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline was significantly lower for the <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> genotype did not significantly impact the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (HR = 1.01, 0.68-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.97) despite significantly lower C0. Based on our experience, a strategy of tacrolimus capping is associated with a better GFR evolution in <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients without any significant increase of BPAR incidence. Our study raised some issues about specific therapeutic tacrolimus C0 targets for <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients and suggests to set up randomized control studies in this specific population.	378	384	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	CYP3A5
The threats involved in the long-term opioid treatment of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) have increased notably. Strategies to identify at-risk patients are important because there is no clear evidence showing which screening or deprescription programmes are appropriate. Our aim was to evaluate the evidence provided by pharmacogenetics applied to predict an analgesic toxicity profile in prescription opioid use disorder (POUD) patients participating in an opioid deprescription programme. Pharmacogenetic markers were analysed in an observational, prospective deprescription programme for POUD patients (n = 88) treated for CNCP. It consisted of monitoring visits (baseline, follow-up and final), opioid rotation or discontinuation and the recording of adverse events and suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Variants in OPRM1 (A118G), ABCB1 (C3435T), COMT (G472A), OPRD1 (T921C) and ARRB2 (C8622T) genes were tested by real-time PCR. Ethics committee approved the study. Wild-type OPRM1-AA genotype carriers reported a significantly higher number of adverse events than OPRM1-AG/GG (median [p25-75], 7 [5-11] vs 5 [3-9]), particularly gastrointestinal system events (90% vs 63%) such as nausea (33% vs 0%). Suspected ADRs (affecting 17% of the patients) were three times higher in males than in females (30% vs 11%). The deprescription programme was effective and safe, and it achieved a significant progressive reduction in the morphine equivalent daily dose, strong opioids and other analgesics' use, without causing any changes in pain intensity or opiate abstinence syndrome. OPRM1 gene polymorphisms could identify the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in POUD patients. Deprescription programmes including pharmacogenetic analysis should be considered during the follow-up of this population.	1640	1656	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	gastrointestinal
A postulated role of subcortical neuromodulators is to control brain states. Mechanisms by which different neuromodulators compete or cooperate at various temporal scales remain an open question. We investigated the interaction of acetylcholine (ACh) and oxytocin (OXT) at slow and fast timescales during various brain states. Although these neuromodulators fluctuated in parallel during NREM packets, transitions from NREM to REM were characterized by a surge of ACh but a continued decrease of OXT. OXT signaling lagged behind ACh. High ACh was correlated with population synchrony and gamma oscillations during active waking, whereas minimum ACh predicts sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs). Optogenetic control of ACh and OXT neurons confirmed the active role of these neuromodulators in the observed correlations. Synchronous hippocampal activity consistently reduced OXT activity, whereas inactivation of the lateral septum-hypothalamus path attenuated this effect. Our findings demonstrate how cooperative actions of these neuromodulators allow target circuits to perform specific functions.	21	48	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	subcortical neuromodulators

Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active drug moiety of mycophenolate, is a potent immunosuppressant agent, which is increasingly being used in the treatment of patients with various autoimmune diseases. An understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate in this population should assist the clinician with rational dosage decisions. This review aims to provide an overview of the published literature on the clinical pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate in autoimmune disease and a briefer summary of current pharmacodynamic knowledge, and to identify areas of potential future research in this field. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE databases as well as bibliographies of relevant articles and 'on-line early' pages of key journals. Twenty-six pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies of mycophenolate in people with autoimmune disease were identified and appraised. Twenty-two of these studies used non-compartmental analysis techniques and four used population modelling methods to estimate mycophenolate pharmacokinetic parameters. Seven studies linked mycophenolate exposure to treatment outcomes. Only four studies measured free (unbound) as well as total mycophenolate exposure and only two studies characterised MPA disposition following enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) administration. Across all studies MPA displayed erratic and complex pharmacokinetics with substantial between-subject variability. Based on total drug measurement, the dose-normalised MPA area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 12 h post-dose (AUC12) varied at least five- to ten-fold between subjects. Typical values for apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of MPA during nonlinear mixed-effects modelling ranged from 8.3 to 25.3 L/h. Patient renal function, serum albumin levels, sex, ethnicity, food intake, concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as antacids, metal-containing medications and proton pump inhibitors and polymorphisms in genes encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase were identified in some studies as having a significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate. Typical MPA CL/F values in autoimmune disease patients were generally slightly lower than values published previously in population pharmacokinetic studies involving renal allograft recipients, possibly because of usage of ciclosporin, poorer renal function or lower serum albumin levels in the renal transplant cohort. In a single crossover study involving ten subjects only, significantly higher MPA AUC12 and maximum MPA concentration (C max) and lower MPA CL/F were reported following EC-MPS administration compared to mycophenolate mofetil administration. MPA exposure correlated well with treatment efficacy in patients with autoimmune disease (response to treatment, active disease and disease markers); however the relationship between MPA exposure and adverse events (infectious episodes, haematological toxicity and gastrointestinal symptoms) was unclear. Further investigation is required in autoimmune diseases such as chronic plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis and following EC-MPS administration. The extent of within-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate is largely unknown and potential covariate influences need to be confirmed in studies with large subject numbers. A relationship between MPA and MPA metabolite exposure and toxicity needs to be established. The contribution of pharmacogenetics to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate warrants further investigation, as does the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring. Dosing to achieve a target MPA AUC12 >35 mg·h/L is likely to lead to better efficacy outcomes in patients with autoimmune disease (rather than just giving standard doses, which lead to a wide range of exposures). However, the relationship between mycophenolate exposure and toxicity requires further investigation to determine the upper end of a target AUC range.	2470	2486	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	renal transplant
Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies. The classical symptoms of FXIII deficiency span from intracranial haemorrhage to delay bleeding or the staying of chronic wounds in the skin including impaired mucosal healing. In this view, FXIII bridges primary haemostasis, coagulation and definite tissue healing. Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing. Accordingly, adequate FXIII levels can drive and predict the prognosis of complex diseases and the outcome of the associated therapies or interventions. In addition, peculiar pharmacogenetics aspects of the FXIII gene are of extraordinary interest. The present review accounts for the recognized role of FXIII in the healing process and gives some examples on how to use it as prognostic biological/ molecular marker or as potential tailored therapeutic molecule in complex diseases.	202	207	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	wound
Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair.

<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Osteosarcoma is the malignant bone tumor most common in children and adolescents. Many cytochrome P-450 (CYP) members detoxify anticancer drugs used in osteosarcoma treatment, and thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate <i>CYP</i> polymorphisms in osteosarcoma patients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The present study investigated DNA from peripheral blood from 70 osteosarcoma patients treated with high doses of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. <i>CYP1A2*1F</i> (163C>A; rs762551); <i>CYP2C9*3</i> (1075A>C; rs1057910); and <i>CYP3A5*3</i> (6986A>G; rs776746) polymorphisms were investigated through real-time PCR using TaqMan probes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The <i>CYP2C9*3</i> allele did not present any association with clinical events. The <i>CYP1A2</i> CC/AC genotypes were associated with ototoxicity occurrence (<i>p</i> = 0.041, odds ratio [OR] = 8.4) and high grades of ototoxicity (<i>p</i> = 0.039, OR = 10.7), when compared with patients carrying the <i>CYP1A2</i> AA genotype. The <i>CYP1A2</i> CC genotype was associated with high grades of diarrhea (<i>p</i> = 0.043, OR = 4.6) and fever (<i>p</i> = 0.041, OR = 7.1) in comparison with the <i>CYP1A2</i> AA/AC genotypes. The <i>CYP3A5</i> CC genotype was associated with weight loss (<i>p</i> = 0.009, OR = 3.8) and high grades of hepatotoxicity (<i>p</i> = 0.010, OR = 4.3) when compared with the <i>CYP3A5</i> TT/CT genotypes. The <i>CYP3A5</i> CC/CT genotypes were associated with high grades of vomit (<i>p</i> = 0.013, OR = 10.8), pulmonary relapse absence (<i>p</i> = 0.029, OR = 9.5), and better overall and event-free survivals (<i>p</i> = 0.017, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.1; <i>p</i> = 0.044, HR = 2.5; respectively) when compared with the <i>CYP3A5</i> AA genotype. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b><i>CYP1A2*1A</i> and <i>CYP3A5*3</i> alleles were associated with toxicity events. <i>CYP3A5*3</i> allele was associated with better survival.
