Apixaban and rivaroxaban are the two most prescribed direct factor Xa inhibitors. With the increased use of DOACs in real-world settings, safety and efficacy concerns have emerged, particularly regarding their concomitant use with other drugs. Increasing evidence highlights drug−drug interactions with CYP3A/P-gp modulators leading to adverse events. However, current recommendations for dose adjustment do not consider CYP3A/P-gp genotype and phenotype. We aimed to determine their impact on apixaban and rivaroxaban blood exposure. Three-hundred hospitalized patients were included. CYP3A and P-gp phenotypic activities were assessed by the metabolic ratio of midazolam and AUC0−6h of fexofenadine, respectively. Relevant CYP3A and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms were also tested. Capillary blood samples collected at four time-points after apixaban or rivaroxaban administration allowed the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. According to the developed multivariable linear regression models, P-gp activity (p < 0.001) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) (p = 0.01) significantly affected apixaban AUC0−6h. P-gp activity (p < 0.001) also significantly impacted rivaroxaban AUC0−6h. The phenotypic switch (from normal to poor metabolizer) of P-gp led to an increase of apixaban and rivaroxaban AUC0−6h by 16% and 25%, respectively, equivalent to a decrease of 38 mL/min in CrCl according to the apixaban model. CYP3A phenotype and tested SNPs of CYP3A/P-gp had no significant impact. In conclusion, P-gp phenotypic activity, rather than known CYP3A/P-gp polymorphisms, could be relevant for dose adjustment.	596	600	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	P-gp

Increasing evidence highlights drug−drug interactions with CYP3A/P-gp modulators leading to adverse events. However, current recommendations for dose adjustment do not consider CYP3A/P-gp genotype and phenotype. We aimed to determine their impact on apixaban and rivaroxaban blood exposure. Three-hundred hospitalized patients were included. CYP3A and P-gp phenotypic activities were assessed by the metabolic ratio of midazolam and AUC0−6h of fexofenadine, respectively. Relevant CYP3A and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms were also tested. Capillary blood samples collected at four time-points after apixaban or rivaroxaban administration allowed the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. According to the developed multivariable linear regression models, P-gp activity (p < 0.001) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) (p = 0.01) significantly affected apixaban AUC0−6h. P-gp activity (p < 0.001) also significantly impacted rivaroxaban AUC0−6h. The phenotypic switch (from normal to poor metabolizer) of P-gp led to an increase of apixaban and rivaroxaban AUC0−6h by 16% and 25%, respectively, equivalent to a decrease of 38 mL/min in CrCl according to the apixaban model. CYP3A phenotype and tested SNPs of CYP3A/P-gp had no significant impact. In conclusion, P-gp phenotypic activity, rather than known CYP3A/P-gp polymorphisms, could be relevant for dose adjustment.	1246	1250	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	P-gp

The purpose of this pharmacokinetics (PK) study was to investigate whether different release kinetics from bupropion hydrochloride (HCl) immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (ER) formulations alter its metabolism and to test the hypothesis that the unsuccessful bioequivalence (BE) study of the higher strength (300 mg) of bupropion HCl ER tablets based on the successful BE study of the lower strength (150 mg) was due to metabolic saturation in the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen. A randomized six-way crossover study was conducted in healthy volunteers. During each period, subjects took a single dose of IR (75/100 mg), SR (100/150 mg), or ER (150/300 mg) formulations of bupropion HCl; plasma samples for PK analysis were collected from 0-96 h for all formulations. In addition, each subject's whole blood was collected for the genotyping of various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of bupropion's major metabolic enzymes. The data indicates that the relative bioavailability of the ER formulations was 72.3-78.8% compared with IR 75 mg. No differences were observed for ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) of metabolite to AUC of parent for the three major metabolites. The pharmacogenomics analysis suggested no statistically significant correlation between polymorphisms and PK parameters of the various formulations. Altogether, these data suggested that the different release kinetics of the formulations did not change metabolites-to-parent ratio. Therefore, the differing BE result between the 150 and 300 mg bupropion HCl ER tablets was unlikely due to the metabolic saturation in the GI lumen caused by different release patterns.	38	40	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	PK

The pharmacogenomics analysis suggested no statistically significant correlation between polymorphisms and PK parameters of the various formulations. Altogether, these data suggested that the different release kinetics of the formulations did not change metabolites-to-parent ratio. Therefore, the differing BE result between the 150 and 300 mg bupropion HCl ER tablets was unlikely due to the metabolic saturation in the GI lumen caused by different release patterns.	1574	1576	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	ER
The latest consensus has changed <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping among Chinese population, while its impact on metoprolol tolerance and adverse events in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases remains unclear. In this study, we prospectively included elderly patients who started metoprolol treatment for cardiovascular indications. According to the latest consensus on <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype-to-phenotype translation, the patients were categorized as normal, intermediate, or poor metabolizers (NMs, IMs, or PMs, respectively) by detecting the presence of the <i>CYP2D6*1</i>, <i>*2</i>, <i>*5</i>, <i>*10</i>, and <i>*14</i>. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between the <i>CYP2D6</i> phenotype and incidence of adverse events, which were assessed over a 12-week period. In this study, there were 651 (62.7%) NMs, 385 (37.1%) IMs, and 3 (0.3%) PMs. After 12 weeks of follow-up, compared with NMs, IMs had the lower maintenance dose [50.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day vs. 25.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day, <i>p</i> < 0.001] and lower weight-adjusted maintenance doses (0.52 ± 0.25 mg/day/kg vs. 0.42 ± 0.22 mg/day/kg, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and had higher incidence of postural hypotension (6.0% vs. 10.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.006), bradycardia (21.5% vs. 28.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.011), asystole (0.8% vs. 3.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and syncope (2.0% vs. 6.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.001). In logistic regression model, the overall incidence of adverse events was 1.37-fold larger in IMs than in NMs (odds ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.79, <i>p</i> = 0.021). We conclude that IMs have lower tolerance and higher incidence of metoprolol-related adverse events than NMs in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases. <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping is justifiable in elderly patients to minimize the risk of adverse events and ensure the benefits of metoprolol.	509	512	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	IMs

Antidepressants, mainly tricyclic and non-selective reuptake inhibitors of serotonin antidepressants, are part of the treatment of chronic pain. The management is complicated by a large interindividual variability of efficacy and tolerance. Important part of this variability is associated with nucleotide polymorphisms of genes encoding enzymes involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these molecules. Identification of these genetic variants could to predict clinical consequences and allowed individualized adjustments in medication or dosage. This article presents the current knowledge on the influence of genetics on the efficacy and adverse effects of antidepressants used in chronic pain treatment.	75	84	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	serotonin
Obesity is a global epidemic that is a leading cause of preventable death. In addition to lifestyle modification, there are numerous obesity treatments for clinicians to consider, including medications. Lorcaserin immediate release/extended release (IR/XR) is a US Food and Drug Administration approved medication for overweight and obese patients to be used with lifestyle modifications. Lorcaserin is thought to reduce weight by targeting the serotonin (5HT<sub>2c</sub>) system to induce satiety. Lorcaserin IR has been shown to be effective in reducing weight in overweight (body mass index [BMI] > 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obese (BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participants in three large Phase III trials. In addition, lorcaserin has been shown to reduce post-cessation weight gain and improved smoking cessation in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. A recent meta-analysis suggested in overweight diabetic patients lorcaserin may be added to first-line oral hypoglycemic medications to enhance reduction in glycated hemoglobin. Lorcaserin is generally well tolerated with the most common side effect being headache, which is typically self-limiting. Lorcaserin XR (once daily) was recently approved and has been shown to be bioequivalent to lorcaserin IR (twice daily) in a pivotal study. Lorcaserin XRs, main advantage over the IR formulation is the once daily dosing regimen, which likely would lead to improved adherence and thus improved clinical effectiveness. The present review will evaluate the lorcaserin clinical studies (obesity, diabetes, and addiction), XR bioequivalence studies, pharmacogenomics of the serotonin (5HT<sub>2c</sub>) system, and adherence data in once daily versus twice daily medications.	445	454	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	serotonin

Prospective DPYD genotyping prevents severe fluoropyrimidine (FP)-induced toxicity by decreasing dosages in DPYD variant allele carriers. FP dosages in chemoradiation therapy (CRT) are lower than those in other FP-containing regimens. Pharmacogenetic guidelines do not distinguish between regimens, leaving physicians in doubt to apply dose reductions. Our aim was to investigate severe toxicity in DPYD variant allele carriers receiving CRT.	12	16	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	DPYD

Previous studies have implicated 5-HT1A receptor gene (HTR1A) polymorphisms in the therapeutic response to antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A functional HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism (rs6295) in the promoter region was found to be associated with antidepressant pharmacogenetics in different populations. However, inconsistent and inconclusive results have been obtained. In this study, we tested whether rs6295 genetic variants are related to antidepressant effects using a meta-analysis method. The relevant literature was acquired through deliberate searching and selection based on the established inclusion criteria for publications. A total of 10 articles were identified, all of which evaluated the HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism and antidepressant response. Dominant and recessive models were tested in the analyses, and the results revealed no association between the HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism and antidepressant response.	33	48	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	5-HT1A receptor

Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors tonically inhibit colonic motility and the alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, given intravenously, increased colonic tone in humans. However, the effect of yohimbine on colonic transit in humans is unknown. In this study, 30 healthy volunteers were randomized to yohimbine 16.2 mg p.o. t.i.d. or identical placebo for 7 days. We evaluated gastric emptying, small intestinal, and colonic transit by scinitigraphy, bowel habits, haemodynamics and plasma catecholamines. As cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize yohimbine, P450 genotypes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) were determined in 25 of 30 subjects who consented to genetic studies. The relationship between drug metabolizer status predicted by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and effects of yohmibine were assessed. Compared to placebo, yohimbine increased (P < or = 0.02) diastolic blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline concentrations and maximum tolerated volume during the satiation test [yohimbine (1241 +/- 88, mean +/- SEM) vs placebo (1015 +/- 87), P = 0.054]. However, yohimbine did not affect gastrointestinal transit. Based on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 alleles, seven and 18 subjects were, respectively, extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of yohimbine. Compared to EM, PM of yohimbine had a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline (P = 0.1 for PM vs EM), lower maximum tolerated volumes (1120 +/- 95 vs 1484 + 131 mL, P = 0.02), and faster colonic transit (i.e. GC(24) was 3.0 +/- 0.4 vs 2.1 +/- 0.5, P = 0.1). These data suggest that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genotypes which determine the metabolism of yohimbine may influence its sympathetic and gastrointestinal effects.	0	28	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors

Phenazepam is commonly administered to patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Some proportion of such patients do not show adequate response to treatment regimen containing phenazepam, whereas many of them experience type A adverse drug reactions. Previous studies showed that CYP2D6 IS involved in the biotransformation of phenazepam, the activity of which is highly dependent on the polymorphism of the gene encoding it. Objective. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of 1846G>A polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene on the concentration/dose indicator of phenazepam, using findings on enzymatic activity of CYP2D6 (as evaluated by the 6M-THBC/pinoline ratio measurement) and on CYP2D6 expression level obtained by measuring the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma concentration levels in patients suffering from major depressive disorder.	289	298	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	CYP2D6 IS

Some proportion of such patients do not show adequate response to treatment regimen containing phenazepam, whereas many of them experience type A adverse drug reactions. Previous studies showed that CYP2D6 IS involved in the biotransformation of phenazepam, the activity of which is highly dependent on the polymorphism of the gene encoding it. Objective.

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) models can serve as a powerful framework for predicting the influence as well as the interaction of formulation, genetic polymorphism and co-medication on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug substances. In this study, flurbiprofen, a potent non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, was chosen as a model drug. Flurbiprofen has absolute bioavailability of ~95% and linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 50-300 mg. Its absorption is considered variable and complex, often associated with double peak phenomena, and its pharmacokinetics are characterized by high inter-subject variability, mainly due to its metabolism by the polymorphic CYP2C9 (fmCYP2C9 ≥ 0.71). In this study, by leveraging <i>in vitro, in silico</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data, an integrated PBPK/PD model with mechanistic absorption was developed and evaluated against clinical data from PK, PD, drug-drug and gene-drug interaction studies. The PBPK model successfully predicted (within 2-fold) 36 out of 38 observed concentration-time profiles of flurbiprofen as well as the CYP2C9 genetic effects after administration of different intravenous and oral dosage forms over a dose range of 40-300 mg in both Caucasian and Chinese healthy volunteers. All model predictions for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub> and CL/F were within two-fold of their respective mean or geometric mean values, while 90% of the predictions of C<sub>max</sub>, 81% of the predictions of AUC<sub>inf</sub> and 74% of the predictions of Cl/F were within 1.25 fold. In addition, the drug-drug and drug-gene interactions were predicted within 1.5-fold of the observed interaction ratios (AUC, C<sub>max</sub> ratios). The validated PBPK model was further expanded by linking it to an inhibitory <i>E<sub>max</sub></i> model describing the analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen and applying it to explore the effect of formulation and genetic polymorphisms on the onset and duration of pain relief. This comprehensive PBPK/PD analysis, along with a detailed translational biopharmaceutic framework including appropriately designed biorelevant <i>in vitro</i> experiments and <i>in vitro-in vivo</i> extrapolation, provided mechanistic insight on the impact of formulation and genetic variations, two major determinants of the population variability, on the PK/PD of flurbiprofen. Clinically relevant specifications and potential dose adjustments were also proposed. Overall, the present work highlights the value of a translational PBPK/PD approach, tailored to target populations and genotypes, as an approach towards achieving personalized medicine.	933	935	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	PK

The pharmacogenetics of antidepressants has been not only a challenging but also frustrating research field since its birth in the 1990s. Indeed, great expectations followed the first evidence of familiar aggregation of antidepressant response. Despite the progress from candidate gene studies to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), results fell out the expectations and they were often inconsistent. Anyway, the cumulative evidence supports the involvement of some genes and molecular pathways in antidepressant efficacy. The best single genes are SLC6A4, HTR2A, BDNF, GNB3, FKBP5, ABCB1, and cytochrome P450 genes (CYP2D6 and CYP2C19). Molecular pathways involved in inflammation and neuroplasticity show the greatest support. The first studies evaluating benefits of genotype-guided antidepressant treatments provided encouraging results and confirmed the relevance of SLC6A4, HTR2A, ABCB1, and cytochrome P450 genes. Further progress in genotyping and data analysis would allow to move forward and complete the understanding of antidepressant pharmacogenetics and its translation into clinical applications.	561	566	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	HTR2A

The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril is hydrolysed to an active metabolite, enalaprilat, in the liver via carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). Previous studies show that variant rs71647871 in the CES1 gene affects the pharmacokinetics of enalapril on liver samples as well as healthy volunteers. This study included 286 Caucasian patients with arterial hypertension who received enalapril. The concentrations of enalapril and enalaprilat were determined before subsequent intake of the drug and 4 h after it with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometric detection. The study included genetic markers as follows: rs2244613, rs71647871 (c.428G>A, p.G143E) and three SNPs indicating the presence of a subtype CES1A1c (rs12149368, rs111604615 and rs201577108). Mean peak and trough enalaprilat concentrations, adjusted by clinical variables, were significantly lower in CES1 rs2244613 heterozygotes (by 16.6% and 19.6%) and in CC homozygotes (by 32.7% and 41.4%) vs. the AA genotype. In CES1A1c homozygotes, adjusted mean enalaprilat concentrations were 75% lower vs. heterozygotes and wild-type (WT) homozygotes. Pharmacogenetic markers of the CES1 gene may be a promising predictor for individualisation when prescribing enalapril.	123	141	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	carboxylesterase 1

In metastatic colorectal cancer, germline pharmacogenomics testing presents a unique opportunity to improve outcomes, since the genes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase metabolizing the chemotherapy drugs, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan are already well known. In a retrospective analysis of the landmark TRIBE clinical trial [(TRIBE - TRIplet plus BEvacizumab multicenter, phase III trial by the Italian Cooperative GONO (Gruppo Oncologico Nord Ovest) group (NCT00719797)], the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was higher in those with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase/UDP-glucuronosyltransferase aberrations and was dose dependent.

The pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus can be partly explained by CYP3A5 activity. Our objective was to evaluate a tacrolimus sparing policy on renal graft outcome according to <i>CYP3A5</i> 6986A>G genetic polymorphism. This retrospective study included 1114 recipients with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Genotyping of the 6986A>G allelic variant corresponding to <i>CYP3A5*3</i> was systematically performed. One year after transplantation, tacrolimus blood trough concentration (C0) target range was 5-7 ng/mL. However, daily dose was capped to 0.10 mg/kg/day regardless of the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype. A total 208 <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients were included. Despite a higher daily dose, <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients exhibited lower C0 during follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of <i>CYP3A5*1</i>/- genotype (HR = 0.70, 0.46-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.10) on patient-graft survival. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline was significantly lower for the <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> genotype did not significantly impact the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (HR = 1.01, 0.68-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.97) despite significantly lower C0. Based on our experience, a strategy of tacrolimus capping is associated with a better GFR evolution in <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients without any significant increase of BPAR incidence. Our study raised some issues about specific therapeutic tacrolimus C0 targets for <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients and suggests to set up randomized control studies in this specific population.	334	357	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	6986A>G allelic variant

The pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus can be partly explained by CYP3A5 activity. Our objective was to evaluate a tacrolimus sparing policy on renal graft outcome according to <i>CYP3A5</i> 6986A>G genetic polymorphism. This retrospective study included 1114 recipients with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Genotyping of the 6986A>G allelic variant corresponding to <i>CYP3A5*3</i> was systematically performed. One year after transplantation, tacrolimus blood trough concentration (C0) target range was 5-7 ng/mL. However, daily dose was capped to 0.10 mg/kg/day regardless of the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype. A total 208 <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients were included. Despite a higher daily dose, <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients exhibited lower C0 during follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of <i>CYP3A5*1</i>/- genotype (HR = 0.70, 0.46-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.10) on patient-graft survival. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline was significantly lower for the <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> genotype did not significantly impact the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (HR = 1.01, 0.68-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.97) despite significantly lower C0.

Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.	458	460	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	PK

Kinetics-based dose targeting is often conducted in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients conditioned with intravenous (IV) or oral busulfan to lower rates of rejection, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse. Using the candidate gene approach, the authors evaluated whether busulfan clearance was associated with polymorphisms in the genes regulating the predominant metabolizing enzymes involved in busulfan conjugation, specifically glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoenzymes A1 (GSTA1) and M1 (GSTM1). Busulfan clearance was estimated after the morning dose on days 1, 2, and 3; each patient's average clearance was used for analyses. The average (± standard deviation) busulfan clearance was 3.2 ± 0.56 mL/min/kg in the separate population of 95 patients who received oral busulfan and 103 ± 24 ml/min/m(2) in the 57 patients who received IV busulfan. Oral busulfan clearance was associated with GSTA1 (P = .008) but not GSTM1 (P = .57) genotypes. However, among the GSTA1 haplotypes (ie, *A*A, *A*B, *B*B), there was significant overlap in the observed oral busulfan clearance and similar rates of achieving the target busulfan exposure. Clearance of IV busulfan was not associated with GSTA1 (P = .21) or GSTM1 (P = .99). These data suggest that personalizing either IV or oral busulfan dosing cannot be simplified on the basis of GSTA1 or GSTM1 genotype.	114	125	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous
SYP-1018 is a lyophilized polymeric nanoparticle formulation of voriconazole that is under development for intravenous dosing.

The objective of this prospective study was to examine the exposure to the main active metabolites of ciprofloxacin in critically ill patients and to examine the factors (demographic, laboratory and genetic) that could potentially affect the drug metabolic conversion of ciprofloxacin. The secondary aim was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for the metabolite showing the most associations with the abovementioned factors. A total of 29 patients were treated with intravenous infusion of ciprofloxacin and enrolled on this trial. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken at 1, 4, and 11.5 h following the completion of the infusion. Sex, age, body weight, height, serum creatinine and bilirubin levels, and creatinine clearance (CL<sub>CR</sub>) were recorded, and polymorphisms rs2032582 and rs1045642 in the <i>ABCB1</i> gene, rs4148977 in the <i>SLCO1A2</i> gene and rs762551 in the <i>CYP1A2</i> gene were analyzed. A three-stage parent drug-metabolite population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Median (IQR) metabolite/parent ratios of the desethylene ciprofloxacin, formyl ciprofloxacin and oxociprofloxacin were 5.86 (4.09-9.87)%, 4.08 (3.38-6.92)% and 5.91 (3.42-13.65)%, respectively. The desethylene ciprofloxacin metabolic ratio was positively associated with height (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2277, <i>p</i> = 0.0089) and CL<sub>CR</sub> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2023, <i>p</i> = 0.0144) and negatively associated with age (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2227, <i>p</i> = 0.0112). Males had a significantly higher oxociprofloxacin metabolic ratio than females (9.14 vs 3.42%, <i>p</i> = 0.0043). In the desethylene ciprofloxacin population PK model, the volume of distribution decreased with age, the parent drug-metabolite transfer rate constant increased with CL<sub>CR</sub>, and the metabolite elimination rate constant decreased with age and is increased in <i>CYP1A2</i> rs762551 variant allele carriers. We therefore hypothesized that the CYP1A2 inhibition by ciprofloxacin is mediated by its metabolite desethylene ciprofloxacin.	477	488	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous

Naltrexone, one of four FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence, has shown moderate efficacy in clinical trials. Pharmacogenetic effects have been reported such that allelic variation at the gene encoding the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1, rs1799971) predicts naltrexone-induced blunting of the positively reinforcing effects of alcohol. However, naltrexone also binds, albeit to a lesser degree, to kappa and delta opioid receptors in the brain. This alternate binding presents the possibility that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the kappa and delta opioid receptor (OPRK1 and OPRD1) genes may contribute to naltrexone pharmacogenetics. Therefore, the goal of this exploratory study was to re-examine data from a double-blind placebo controlled laboratory trial of naltrexone for pharmacogenetic effects at kappa and delta opioid receptor tag SNPs. Participants were 40 heavy drinkers (12 female) who underwent an intravenous alcohol challenge paradigm after receiving naltrexone (50mg) or placebo in randomized and crossover fashion. Dependent variables were self-reported alcohol-induced stimulation, sedation, and craving. Multilevel models revealed a significant Naltrexone×OPRK1 Genotype (rs997917) interaction predicting alcohol-induced sedation, such that TT homozygotes reported lower naltrexone-induced alcohol sedation as compared to carriers of the C allele. Moreover, there was a significant Naltrexone×OPRD1 Genotype (rs4654327) interaction predicting alcohol-induced stimulation and craving, such that carriers of the A allele at this locus reported greater naltrexone-induced blunting of alcohol stimulation and alcohol craving compared to GG homozygotes. These findings suggest that additional pharmacogenetic effects in the opioid receptor system may account for individual differences in response to naltrexone in the human laboratory.	936	974	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous alcohol challenge paradigm
Membrane transporters are important determinants of drug bioavailability. Their expression and activity affect the intracellular drug concentration in leukemic cells impacting response to therapy. Pharmacogenomics represents genetic markers that reflect allele arrangement of genes encoding drug transporters associated with treatment response. In previous work, we identified SNP rs460089 located in the promotor of SLC22A4 gene encoding imatinib transporter OCTN1 as influential on response of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib. Patients with rs460089-GC pharmacogenotype had significantly superior response to first-line imatinib treatment compared to patients with rs460089-GG. This study investigated whether pharmacogenotypes of rs460089 are associated with sustainability of treatment-free remission (TFR) in patients from the EUROpean Stop Kinase Inhibitor (EURO-SKI) trial. In the learning sample, 176 patients showed a significantly higher 6-month probability of molecular relapse free survival (MRFS) in patients with GC genotype (73%, 95% CI: 60-82%) compared to patients with GG (51%, 95% CI: 41-61%). Also over time, patients with GC genotype had significantly higher MRFS probabilities compared with patients with GG (HR: 0.474, 95% CI: 0.280-0.802, p = 0.0054). Both results were validated with data on 93 patients from the Polish STOP imatinib study. In multiple regression models, in addition to the investigated genotype, duration of TKI therapy (EURO-SKI trial) and duration of deep molecular response (Polish study) were identified as independent prognostic factors. The SNP rs460089 was found as an independent predictor of TFR.	115	128	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
TNF-α inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy both as monotherapy and in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the treatment of chronic inflammatory immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis (Ps) and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and may be administered off-label to treat disseminated granuloma annulare, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. There are several TNF-α inhibitors available for clinical use including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept. In this article, we discuss the efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of spondyloarthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Etanercept is effective in the treatment of PsA, AS, JIA and uveitis. Independent predictors of achieving a sustained clinical improvement or MDA in children with JIA include shorter disease duration, no concurrent oral corticosteroid use, history of chronic anterior uveitis and age <9 years. IBD incidence was lower in patients receiving etanercept plus MTX. Intra-articular administration of etanercept seems to favor a prompt target joint improvement without serious adverse events. Etanercept improve endothelial function reducing the risk of acute cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events. The most commonly reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, epidermal and dermal conditions, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, headache and fatigue.	1123	1138	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	Intra-articular

Polymorphisms in the drug transporter gene ABCB1 account for differences in the clinically efficacy of the most drugs, most likely by influencing their access to the brain. The majority proportion of depressed patients, given a regular dose, do not respond properly or experience severe side effects. One explanation may be the polymorphisms in the drug transporter gene ABCB1, which account for differences in the clinical efficacy of antidepressants, neuroleptics or mood stabilizers most likely by influencing their access to the brain. If patients are treated with a substrate of P-gp, functionally relevant genetic variants in the ABCB1 transporter could influence intracerebral drug concentrations and, thereby, clinical response. The review shows recently investigated clinical impact of ABCB1 variants including the three most important SNPs rs1045642, rs2032582, and rs2032583. In the paper, with respect not to go beyond the scope of this review, we will focus on these three SNPs. The final goal of pharmacogenetics is to help clinicians to choose the best treatment for each individual patient. >From the evidence reviewed in this publication, it is likely that combination of metabolizing and drug target polymorphisms will produce the best prediction for the selection of the optimal dose and optimal drug as a function of the individual` s genetic profile.	670	683	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracerebral
A wide interindividual variability in survival after cancer treatment is observed. This is attributable to many factors, including tumour and patient related factors. Genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters may be one of these factors. Drug metabolising enzymes are responsible for the activation, inactivation and detoxification of many chemotherapeutic agents. Deficiencies in these enzymes may result in altered exposure (both extracellular and intracellular) to the chemotherapeutic agents, thereby influencing the efficacy of treatment. Drug transporters are important in the uptake and excretion of chemotherapeutic agents. Polymorphisms in drug transporter genes may influence the bioavailability and disposition of these agents. Studies have shown that variability in survival can (partly) be explained by polymorphisms in genes encoding drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters. This review will discuss the role of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters in relation to survival after cancer treatment. The most important polymorphisms shown to influence survival after cancer treatment are polymorphisms in the genes encoding the phase II detoxification enzymes glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). It appears that GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null have a clear association with longer overall survival in patients with different malignancies who are treated with substrates for these GSTs (mostly alkylating agents and platinum compounds). Genetic polymorphisms in GSTP1 and GSTA1 are also associated with an increased overall survival in patients with different malignancies. Most of the current data on the relation between treatment response and pharmacogenetics is derived from retrospective and exploratory studies. Prospective studies will be necessary.	463	476	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	extracellular

FSH brings about its physiological actions by activating a specific receptor located on target cells. Normal functioning of the FSH receptor (FSHR) is crucial for follicular development and estradiol production in females and for the regulation of Sertoli cell function and spermatogenesis in males. In the last two decades, the number of inactivating and activating mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and spliced variants of FSHR gene has been identified in selected infertile cases. Information on genotype-phenotype correlation and in vitro functional characterization of the mutants has helped in understanding the possible genetic cause for female infertility in affected individuals. The information is also being used to dissect various extracellular and intracellular events involved in hormone-receptor interaction by studying the differences in the properties of the mutant receptor when compared with WT receptor. Studies on polymorphisms in the FSHR gene have shown variability in clinical outcome among women treated with FSH. These observations are being explored to develop molecular markers to predict the optimum dose of FSH required for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Pharmacogenetics is an emerging field in this area that aims at designing individual treatment protocols for reproductive abnormalities based on FSHR gene polymorphisms. The present review discusses the current knowledge of various genetic alterations in FSHR and their impact on receptor function in the female reproductive system.	753	766	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	extracellular

A behavioral economic approach to understanding the relative value of alcohol may be useful for advancing medication development for alcoholism. Naltrexone is a heavily researched and moderately effective treatment for alcohol dependence making it a good candidate for a proof-of-concept study of behavioral economics and alcoholism pharmacotherapy. This study examines naltrexone efficacy and pharmacogenetics in terms of the relative value of alcohol, assessed via demand curve analysis. Participants were 35 heavy drinking (AUDIT ≥8) Asian Americans. A within-subjects cross-over medication design was used along with an intravenous alcohol challenge completed after 4 days of both naltrexone and placebo. At baseline and BrAC = 0.06g/dl, participants completed an Alcohol Purchase Task, which assessed estimated alcohol consumption along escalating prices. Behavioral economic demand curve analysis yielded measures of intensity, elasticity, maximum expenditure (O(max)), proportionate price insensitivity (P(max)) and breakpoint. Compared to placebo, naltrexone significantly reduced intensity, O(max) and breakpoint. There were also trend-level medication effects on P(max). BrAC was associated with increases in P(max) and breakpoint. A significant naltrexone × OPRM1 genotype interaction was observed for intensity of demand. The present study extends the literature on naltrexone's mechanisms through the application of a novel behavioral economic paradigm. These results indicate that naltrexone reduces several indices of demand for alcohol. This preliminary report provides further evidence for the effectiveness of naltrexone and supports the utility of a behavioral economic approach to alcoholism pharmacotherapy development.	624	669	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous alcohol challenge completed after
Adequate levels of folates are essential for homeostasis of the organism, prevention of congenital malformations, and the salvage of predisposed disease states. They depend on genetic predisposition, and therefore, a pharmacogenetic approach to individualized supplementation or therapeutic intervention is necessary for an optimal outcome. The role of folates in vital cell processes was investigated by translational pharmacogenetics employing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Depriving cells of folates led to reversible S-phase arrest. Since 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of an active folate form, we evaluated the relevance of polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene on intracellular levels of bioactive metabolite, the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-Me-THF). LCLs (<i>n</i> = 35) were divided into low- and normal-MTHFR activity groups based on their genotype. They were cultured in the presence of folic acid (FA) or 5-Me-THF. Based on the cells' metabolic activity and intracellular 5-Me-THF levels, we conclude supplementation of FA is sufficient to maintain adequate folate level in the normal MTHFR activity group, while low MTHFR activity cells require 5-Me-THF to overcome the metabolic defects caused by polymorphisms in their MTHFR genes. This finding was supported by the determination of intracellular levels of 5-Me-THF in cell lysates by LC-MS/MS. FA supplementation resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in 5-Me-THF in cells with normal MTHFR activity, but there was no increase after FA supplementation in low MTHFR activity cells. However, when LCLs were exposed to 5-Me-THF, a 10-fold increase in intracellular levels of this metabolite was determined. These findings indicate that patients undergoing folate supplementation to counteract anti-folate therapies, or patients with increased folate demand, would benefit from pharmacogenetics-based therapy choices.	725	738	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular

The role of folates in vital cell processes was investigated by translational pharmacogenetics employing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Depriving cells of folates led to reversible S-phase arrest. Since 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of an active folate form, we evaluated the relevance of polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene on intracellular levels of bioactive metabolite, the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-Me-THF). LCLs (<i>n</i> = 35) were divided into low- and normal-MTHFR activity groups based on their genotype. They were cultured in the presence of folic acid (FA) or 5-Me-THF. Based on the cells' metabolic activity and intracellular 5-Me-THF levels, we conclude supplementation of FA is sufficient to maintain adequate folate level in the normal MTHFR activity group, while low MTHFR activity cells require 5-Me-THF to overcome the metabolic defects caused by polymorphisms in their MTHFR genes. This finding was supported by the determination of intracellular levels of 5-Me-THF in cell lysates by LC-MS/MS. FA supplementation resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in 5-Me-THF in cells with normal MTHFR activity, but there was no increase after FA supplementation in low MTHFR activity cells. However, when LCLs were exposed to 5-Me-THF, a 10-fold increase in intracellular levels of this metabolite was determined. These findings indicate that patients undergoing folate supplementation to counteract anti-folate therapies, or patients with increased folate demand, would benefit from pharmacogenetics-based therapy choices.	1352	1365	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular

Analysis of the genotype that predicts the phenotypic characteristics of a cohort of glaucoma and ocular hypertension patients, and the correlation with their personal pharmacological response to beta-blockers (BB) and prostaglandin analogues (PGA). Prospective study that included 139 eyes from 72 patients under BB and/or PGA treatment, and in some cases other types of ocular hypotensive treatments. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped by real-time PCR assays: prostaglandin-F2α receptor (rs3766355, rs3753380); cytochrome-P450 2D6 (rs16947, rs769258); and beta-2-adrenergic receptor (rs1042714). Other studied variables were mean deviation (MD) of visual field, previous ocular interventions, medical treatment, baseline (bIOP), and treated intraocular pressure (tIOP). From a total of 139 eyes, 71 (51.1%) were left eyes. The main diagnosis was primary open angle glaucoma (66.2%). A total of 57 (41%) eyes were under three or more medications (PGA + BB + other) and, additionally, 57 eyes (41%) had had some kind of glaucoma surgery. The mean bIOP and tIOP were 26.55 ± 8.19 and 21.01 ± 5.54 mmHg, respectively. Significant differences in tIOP were found between heterozygous (HT) (21.07 ± 0.607 mmHg) and homozygous (HM) (20.98 ± 0.639 mmHg) rs3766355 with respect to wildtype individuals (16 ± 1.08 mmHg) (<i>p</i> = 0.031). The MD values presented significant differences between wildtype rs3766355 (-2 ± 2.2 dB), HT (-3.87 ± 4 dB), and HM carriers (-9.37 ± 9.51 dB) (<i>p</i> = 0.009). Significant differences were also observed between the MD in wildtype rs3753380 (-6.1 ± 8.67 dB), HT (-9.02 ± 8.63 dB), and HM carriers (-9.51 ± 7.44 dB) (<i>p</i> = 0.017). Patients carrying the variant rs3766355 in HM or HT presented clinically-significantly higher tIOP than wildtype patients. Additionally, some differences in MD were found in rs3766355 and rs3753380 carriers, and the more alleles that were affected, the worse the MD value, meaning greater severity of the glaucoma. Poor response to treatment and more visual field damage may be associated with being a carrier of these mutated alleles.	761	772	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intraocular
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), primarily the combination of aspirin with a P2Y12 inhibitor, in patients undergoing intravascular stent or flow diverter placement remains the primary strategy to reduce device-related thromboembolic complications. However, selection, timing, and dosing of DAPT is critical and can be challenging given the existing significant inter- and intraindividual response variations to P2Y12 inhibitors.	118	131	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravascular
Genetic variants associated with asthma pathogenesis and altered response to drug therapy are discussed. Many studies implicate polymorphisms in genes encoding the enzymes responsible for leukotriene synthesis and intracellular signaling through activation of seven transmembrane domain receptors, such as the cysteinyl leukotriene 1 (CYSLTR1) and 2 (CYSLTR2) receptors. The leukotrienes are polyunsaturated lipoxygenated eicosatetraenoic acids that exhibit a wide range of pharmacological and physiological actions. Of the three enzymes involved in the formation of the leukotrienes, arachidonate 5 lipoxygenase 5 (ALOX5), leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), and leukotriene hydrolase (LTA4H) are all polymorphic. These polymorphisms often result in variable production of the CysLTs (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) and LTB4. Variable number tandem repeat sequences located in the Sp1-binding motif within the promotor region of the <i>ALOX5</i> gene are associated with leukotriene burden and bronchoconstriction independent of asthma risk. A 444A > C SNP polymorphism in the <i>LTC4S</i> gene, encoding an enzyme required for the formation of a glutathione adduct at the C-6 position of the arachidonic acid backbone, is associated with severe asthma and altered response to the CYSLTR1 receptor antagonist zafirlukast. Genetic variability in the CysLT pathway may contribute additively or synergistically to altered drug responses. The 601 A > G variant of the <i>CYSLTR2</i> gene, encoding the Met201Val <i>CYSLTR2</i> receptor variant, is associated with atopic asthma in the general European population, where it is present at a frequency of ∼2.6%. The variant was originally found in the founder population of Tristan da Cunha, a remote island in the South Atlantic, in which the prevalence of atopy is approximately 45% and the prevalence of asthma is 36%. <i>In vitro</i> work showed that the atopy-associated Met201Val variant was inactivating with respect to ligand binding, Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and inositol phosphate generation. In addition, the <i>CYSLTR1</i> gene, located at Xq13-21.1, has been associated with atopic asthma. The activating Gly300Ser CYSLTR1 variant is discussed. In addition to genetic loci, risk for asthma may be influenced by environmental factors such as smoking. The contribution of CysLT pathway gene sequence variants to atopic asthma is discussed in the context of other genes and environmental influences known to influence asthma.	214	227	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
The mechanism(s) underlying the occurrence of statin-induced myopathy are ill defined, but the results of observational studies and clinical trials provide compelling evidence that skeletal muscle toxicity is a frequent, dose-dependent, adverse event associated with all statins. It has been suggested that reduced availability of metabolites produced by the mevalonate pathway rather than intracellular cholesterol lowering per se might be the primary trigger of toxicity, however other alternative explanations have gained credibility in recent years. Aim of this review is: (i) to describe the molecular mechanisms associated to statin induced myopathy including defects in isoprenoids synthesis followed by altered prenylation of small GTPase, such as Ras and Rab proteins; (ii) to present the emerging aspects on pharmacogenetics, including CYP3A4, OATP1B1 and glycine amidinotransferase (GATM) polymorphisms impacting either statin bioavailability or creatine synthesis; (iii) to summarize the available epidemiological evidences; and (iii) to discuss the concepts that would be of interest to the clinicians for the daily management of patients with statin induced myopathy. The interplay between drug-environment and drug-drug interaction in the context of different genetic settings contribute to statins and skeletal muscles toxicity. Until specific assays/algorithms able to combine genetic scores with drug-drug-environment interaction to identify patients at risk of myopathies will become available, clinicians should continue to monitor carefully patients on polytherapy which include statins and be ready to reconsider dose, statin or switching to alternative treatments. The beneficial effects of adding agents to provide the muscle with the metabolites, such as CoQ10, affected by statin treatment will also be addressed.	390	424	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular cholesterol lowering
The relevance of the multidrug resistance (ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance (ABCG2) protein transporter polymorphisms for treatment with long-acting intramuscular (LAI) risperidone is largely unknown. We explored the relationship between these polymorphisms and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 genotype-predicted phenotype in their effects on drug disposition and clinical outcomes in adults with schizophrenia. In a 24-week observational study, patients initiated on LAI-risperidone (n=101) were genotyped [enzymes (CYP2D6 dupl,*3,*4,*5,*6,*41; CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3), transporters (ABCG2 421C>A; ABCB1 1236C>T, 2677G>T/A, 3435C>T)] and evaluated for steady-state (weeks 6-8) serum levels of dose-corrected risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone, risperidone+9-OH-risperidone (active moiety), and for response to treatment (PANSS, reduction vs. baseline ≥30% at week 12 and ≥45% at week 24). CYP2D6 normal/ultrarapid metabolizers (NM/UM) (vs. other) had lower risperidone (29%) and active moiety levels (24%) (9-OH-risperidone not affected). The effect on the three analytes was mild (0 to 23% reduction) in ABCG2 wild-type homozygotes and pronounced (44-55% reduction) in ABCG2 variant allele carriers. ABCG2 variant had no effect on disposition in CYP2D6 "other" phenotypes, while the effect was pronounced in CYP2D6 NM/UM subjects (31-37% reduction). ABCB1 polymorphisms had no effect on exposure to risperidone. CYP2D6 NM/UM phenotype tended to lower odds of PANSS response, ABCG2 variant was associated with 4-fold higher odds and ABCB1 (1236C>T, 2677G>T/A, 3435C>T) overall mainly wild-type genotype was associated with around 4--fold lower odds of response. In patients treated with LAI-risperidone, CYP2D6 phenotype effect on systemic exposure is conditional on the ABCG2 421C>A polymorphism. ABCG2 and ABCB1 polymorphisms affect clinical response independently of systemic risperidone disposition.	152	165	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intramuscular
An important factor determining the pharmacological response to antitumor drugs is their concentrations in cancer cells, which accounts for the net interaction with their intracellular molecular targets. Accordingly, mechanisms leading to reduced intracellular levels of active agents play a crucial role in cancer chemoresistance. These include impaired drug uptake through solute carrier (SLC) proteins and efficient drug export by ATP-dependent pumps belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of proteins. Since the net movement of drugs in-and-out the cells depends on the overall expression of carrier proteins, defining the so-called transportome, special attention has been devoted to the study of transcriptome regarding these proteins. Nevertheless, genetic variants affecting <i>SLC</i> and <i>ABC</i> genes may markedly affect the bioavailability and, hence, the efficacy of anticancer drugs.	171	184	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular

Membrane transporters play an essential role in the pharmacokinetics of drugs as they mediate exchanges between biological compartments. Tacrolimus is characterized by wide interpatient variability in terms of its pharmacokinetics that may in part be due to genetic factors. The pharmacogenetics of drug transporters is therefore a promising area to explore in the clinical pharmacology of tacrolimus. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of currently available data regarding the pharmacogenetics of membrane transporters that may be involved in the interindividual variability of the response to tacrolimus. Several genetic variants in genes coding for influx or efflux membrane transporters (e.g. ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC8, SLC30A8, SLCO1B1/3, SLC28A1, SLC22A11, and SLC28A3) have been associated with tacrolimus pharmacokinetics variability or the occurrence of toxicity; however, there is still a degree of controversy as to the impact of these variants in vivo and further investigations are needed to confirm these results in larger cohorts and to validate the relevance of such genetic biomarkers for personalization of immunosuppressive therapy in solid organ transplantations. The relationship between transporter polymorphisms and the intracellular concentration of tacrolimus should also be further investigated. Finally, the main challenge could be elucidation of the interplay of biological mechanisms underlying genetic variations that alter the drug concentration or its clinical effect.	1252	1265	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular

The present study aimed to identify polymorphic genes encoding carbonyl reductases (CBR1, CBR3) and investigate their influence on doxorubicin disposition in Asian breast cancer patients (n = 62). Doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)) was administered every 3 weeks for four to six cycles and the pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using non-compartmental analysis (WinNonlin). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to assess genotypic-phenotypic correlations. Five CBR1 (-48G>A, c.219G>C, c.627C>T, c.693G>A, +967G>A) and CBR3 (c.11G>A, c.255C>T, c.279C>T, c.606G>A, c.730G>A) polymorphisms were identified. The CBR1 D2 diplotypes were characterized by the presence of at least one variant allele at the c.627C>T and +967G>A loci. Patients in the CBR1 D1 diplotype group had significantly higher clearance (CL) normalized to body surface area (BSA) (CL/BSA[L/h/m(2)]: median 25.09; range 16.44-55.66) and significantly lower exposure levels; area under curve (AUC(0-infinity)/dose/BSA [h/m(5)]; median 15.08; range 6.18-38.03) of doxorubicin compared with patients belonging to the CBR1 D2 diplotype group (CL/BSA[L/h/m(2)]; median 20.88; range 8.68-31.79, P = 0.014; and AUC(0-infinity)/dose/BSA[h/m(5)]; median 21.35; range 9.82-67.17, P = 0.007 respectively). No significant influence of CBR3 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin were observed in Asian cancer patients. The present exploratory study shows that CBR1 D2 diplotypes correlate with significantly higher exposure levels of doxorubicin, suggesting the possibility of lowered intracellular conversion to doxorubicinol in these patients. Further evaluation of carbonyl reductase polymorphisms in influencing the treatment efficacy of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in Asian cancer patients are warranted.	1545	1558	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
Natural and synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely employed in a number of inflammatory, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases, and, despite the introduction of novel therapies, remain the first-line treatment for inducing remission in moderate to severe active Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Despite their extensive therapeutic use and the proven effectiveness, considerable clinical evidence of wide inter-individual differences in GC efficacy among patients has been reported, in particular when these agents are used in inflammatory diseases. In recent years, a detailed knowledge of the GC mechanism of action and of the genetic variants affecting GC activity at the molecular level has arisen from several studies. GCs interact with their cytoplasmic receptor, and are able to repress inflammatory gene expression through several distinct mechanisms. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is therefore crucial for the effects of these agents: mutations in the GR gene (NR3C1, nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1) are the primary cause of a rare, inherited form of GC resistance; in addition, several polymorphisms of this gene have been described and associated with GC response and toxicity. However, the GR is not self-standing in the cell and the receptor-mediated functions are the result of a complex interplay of GR and many other cellular partners. The latter comprise several chaperonins of the large cooperative hetero-oligomeric complex that binds the hormone-free GR in the cytosol, and several factors involved in the transcriptional machinery and chromatin remodeling, that are critical for the hormonal control of target genes transcription in the nucleus. Furthermore, variants in the principal effectors of GCs (e.g. cytokines and their regulators) have also to be taken into account for a comprehensive evaluation of the variability in GC response. Polymorphisms in genes involved in the transport and/or metabolism of these hormones have also been suggested as other possible candidates of interest that could play a role in the observed inter-individual differences in efficacy and toxicity. The best-characterized example is the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein, a membrane transporter that extrudes GCs from cells, thereby lowering their intracellular concentration. This protein is encoded by the ABCB1/MDR1 gene; this gene presents different known polymorphic sites that can influence its expression and function. This editorial reviews the current knowledge on this topic and underlines the role of genetics in predicting GC clinical response. The ambitious goal of pharmacogenomic studies is to adapt therapies to a patient's specific genetic background, thus improving on efficacy and safety rates.	2281	2294	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
Pharmacological treatment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for 10-20% of direct costs, and fewer than 20% of AD patients are moderate responders to conventional drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine), with doubtful cost-effectiveness. Both AD pathogenesis and drug metabolism are genetically regulated complex traits in which hundreds of genes cooperatively participate. Structural genomics studies demonstrated that more than 200 genes might be involved in AD pathogenesis regulating dysfunctional genetic networks leading to premature neuronal death. The AD population exhibits a higher genetic variation rate than the control population, with absolute and relative genetic variations of 40-60% and 0.85-1.89%, respectively. AD patients also differ in their genomic architecture from patients with other forms of dementia. Functional genomics studies in AD revealed that age of onset, brain atrophy, cerebrovascular hemodynamics, brain bioelectrical activity, cognitive decline, apoptosis, immune function, lipid metabolism dyshomeostasis, and amyloid deposition are associated with AD-related genes. Pioneering pharmacogenomics studies also demonstrated that the therapeutic response in AD is genotype-specific, with apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4/4 carriers the worst responders to conventional treatments. About 10-20% of Caucasians are carriers of defective cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 polymorphic variants that alter the metabolism and effects of AD drugs and many psychotropic agents currently administered to patients with dementia. There is a moderate accumulation of AD-related genetic variants of risk in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs) and ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs), who are the worst responders to conventional drugs. The association of the APOE-4 allele with specific genetic variants of other genes (e.g., CYP2D6, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]) negatively modulates the therapeutic response to multifactorial treatments affecting cognition, mood, and behavior. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic factors may account for 60-90% of drug variability in drug disposition and pharmacodynamics. The incorporation of pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic protocols to AD research and clinical practice can foster therapeutics optimization by helping to develop cost-effective pharmaceuticals and improving drug efficacy and safety.	923	938	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	cerebrovascular
We have recently shown that fluoxetine, a serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has low micromolar affinity for the 5-HT(2C) receptor (but not for 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2B) receptors) in primary cultures of mouse astrocytes. This was determined as phosphorylation (stimulation) of extracellular-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK(1/2)) by transactivation-mediated phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, followed by conventional EGF receptor signaling (Li et al., Psychopharmacology 194:333-334, 2007). Paroxetine has an identical effect. The present study shows that chronic fluoxetine treatment with even higher affinity (EC(50) = 0.5-2.0 microM) upregulates Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), which releases arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of membrane-bound phospholipid, without effect on secretory PLA(2) (sPLA(2)) and intracellular PLA(2) (iPLA(2)).	866	879	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular

This article provides an overview of the science and presents common examples of PGx as it relates to drug and/or drug dose selection. Additionally, there are brief summaries of the role infusion nurses can play relative to toxicity monitoring, patient education, and other aspects of PGx.	285	298	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenously
Esomeprazole is one of the most commonly used drugs to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcers, but the quantitative relationships among the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and pharmacogenomics (PG) of the drug are not fully understood in special patient populations. A clinical PK/PD/PG study of intravenous (IV) esomeprazole in 5 dosing regimens was conducted in 20 healthy Chinese volunteers, who were categorized into Helicobacter pylori (HP)-negative and HP-positive subgroups. Plasma esomeprazole concentration and intragastric H(+) concentration were monitored for 24 hours postdosing. Population PK (PopPK) models were tested based on elimination characteristics and other data. For a single-dose IV esomeprazole regimen, a 2-compartment model with nonlinear elimination characteristics fitted the PK data well. The elimination of esomeprazole was found to be significantly linked to CYP2C19 genotype by 11% to 29%. A mechanism-based PD model was first tested to mimic the irreversible inhibition of H(+) /K(+) -ATPase by esomeprazole using a cell-killing mechanism and models of gastric H(+) secretion that included the effects of an asymmetric circadian rhythm and food effects. Results from this PD model showed that the turnover rate of H(+) /K(+) -ATPase was significantly different between HP-negative and HP-positive subgroups. In conclusion, the PopPK model quantitatively identified the effects of the CYP2C19 genotype on esomeprazole elimination in healthy subjects for the first time. In addition, the effects of HP status on drug effect, H(+) /K(+) -ATPase turnover, and circadian rhythm amplitude were preliminarily explored using a mechanism-based PD model.	327	338	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous
Many clinically used antiviral drugs are nucleoside or nucleotide analog drugs, which have a unique mechanism of action that requires intracellular phosphorylation. This dependence on intracellular activation presents novel challenges for the discovery and development of nucleoside/nucleotide analog drugs. Contrary to many small molecule drug development programs that rely on plasma pharmacokinetics and systemic exposures, the precise mechanisms that result in efficacious intracellular nucleoside triphosphate concentrations must be understood in the process of nucleoside/nucleotide drug development. The importance is highlighted here, using the following as case studies: the herpes treatment acyclovir, the cytomegalovirus therapy ganciclovir, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatments based on tenofovir, which are also in use for HIV prophylaxis. For each drug, the specificity of metabolism that results in its activation in different cells or tissues is discussed, and the implications explored. Acyclovir's dependence on a viral enzyme for activation provides selective pressure for resistance mutations. Ganciclovir is also dependent on a viral enzyme for activation, and suicide gene therapy capitalizes on that for a novel oncology treatment. The tissue of most relevance for tenofovir activation depends on its use as treatment or as prophylaxis, and the pharmacogenomics and drug-drug interactions in those tissues must be considered. Finally, differential metabolism of different tenofovir prodrugs and its effects on toxicity risk are explored. Taken together, these examples highlight the importance of understanding tissue specific metabolism for optimal use of nucleoside/nucleotide drugs in the clinic. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Nucleoside and nucleotide analogue drugs are cornerstones in current antiviral therapy and prevention efforts that require intracellular phosphorylation for activity. Understanding their cell and tissue specific metabolism enables their rational, precision use for maximum efficacy.	134	147	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular

The tissue of most relevance for tenofovir activation depends on its use as treatment or as prophylaxis, and the pharmacogenomics and drug-drug interactions in those tissues must be considered. Finally, differential metabolism of different tenofovir prodrugs and its effects on toxicity risk are explored. Taken together, these examples highlight the importance of understanding tissue specific metabolism for optimal use of nucleoside/nucleotide drugs in the clinic. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Nucleoside and nucleotide analogue drugs are cornerstones in current antiviral therapy and prevention efforts that require intracellular phosphorylation for activity. Understanding their cell and tissue specific metabolism enables their rational, precision use for maximum efficacy.	1883	1896	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a rare but serious adverse drug reaction. Our previous whole-exome sequencing study found SIRT1 intronic region single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7896005 to be associated with MRONJ in cancer patients treated with intravenous (iv) bisphosphonates (BPs). This study aimed to identify causal variants for this association. In silico analyses identified three SNPs (rs3758391, rs932658, and rs2394443) in the SIRT1 promoter region that are in high linkage disequilibrium (r<sup>2</sup>  > 0.8) with rs7896005. To validate the association between these SNPs and MRONJ, we genotyped these three SNPs on the germline DNA from 104 cancer patients of European ancestry treated with iv BPs (46 cases and 58 controls). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed the minor alleles of these three SNPs were associated with lower odds for MRONJ. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) and p values were 0.351 (0.164-0.751; p = 0.007) for rs3758391, 0.351 (0.164-0.751; p = 0.007) for rs932658, and 0.331 (0.157-0.697; p = 0.0036) for rs2394443, respectively. In the reporter gene assays, constructs containing rs932658 with variant allele A had higher luciferase activity than the reference allele, whereas constructs containing SNP rs3758391 and/or rs2394443 did not significantly affect activity. These results indicate that the promoter SNP rs932658 regulates the expression of SIRT1 and presumably lowers the risk of MRONJ by increasing SIRT1 expression. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).	274	285	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous
Busulfan (Bu) is a key component of conditioning regimens used before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in children. Different predictive methods have been used to calculate the first dose of Bu. To evaluate the necessity of further improvements, we retrospectively analyzed the currently available weight- and age-based guidelines to calculate the first doses in 101 children who underwent allogenic SCT in CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, after an intravenous Bu-containing conditioning regimen according to genetic and clinical factors. The measured areas under the curve (AUCs) were within target (900 to 1500 µM/min) in 38.7% of patients after the administration of the first dose calculated based on age and weight, as locally recommended. GSTA1 diplotypes linked to poor Bu metabolism (G3) and fludarabine-containing regimens were the only factors associated with AUC within target (OR, 4.7 [95% CI, 1.1 to 19.8, P = .04]; and OR, 9.9 [95% CI, 1.6 to 61.7, P = .01], respectively). From the 11 methods selected for dose calculation, the percentage of AUCs within the target varied between 16% and 74%. In some models G3 was associated with AUCs within the therapeutic and the toxic range, whereas rapid metabolizers (G1) were correlated with subtherapeutic AUCs when different methods were used. These associations were confirmed by clearance-prediction analysis, in which GSTA1 diplotypes consistently influenced the prediction errors of the methods. These findings suggest that these factors should be considered in Bu dose prediction in addition to the anthropometric data from patients. Furthermore, our data indicated that GSTA1 diplotypes was a factor that should be included in future population pharmacokinetic models, including similar conditioning regiments, to improve the prediction of Bu exposure after its initial dose.	459	470	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous
The study of genetic polymorphisms involved in antidepressants (AD) response is essential to provide a personalized medicine approach in the field of depression. β-arrestin 2 (ARRB2) is a candidate gene in the pharmacogenetics of AD as it is involved in the signaling cascade downstream of numerous neurotransmitter receptors. We investigated the association between five ARRB2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): rs1045280, rs2036657, rs4790694, rs3786047 and rs452246, and response to AD treatment in a sample of 569 patients with a major depressive episode treated for 6months. We show that GG/GT patients for rs4522461 (n=534) and AA/AC patients for rs4790694 (n=244) have a lower response to AD than other genotype groups (HDRS score of 10.9 vs 8.0 after 6months, multivariate analysis: p=0.03; 12.2 vs 9.6, p=0.02, respectively). These data provide additional evidence that β-arrestin 2 is a regulator of intracellular signal transduction processes involved in AD treatment.	915	928	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
Since its discovery in 1988, the endothelin system has been employed in multiple physiological and pathological roles. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is not only a major regulator of vascular tone and cardiac contractility but also exerts mitogenic effects and is involved in inflammatory responses. ET-1 acts via two endothelin receptors located mainly on smooth muscle and endothelial cells through complex intracellular pathways differing between receptors and cell types. Polymorphisms of the endothelin receptor A have been associated not only with the risk in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), systolic heart failure and systemic hypertension but are also of prognostic significance in dilated cardiomyopathy. Polymorphisms of endothelin receptors might lead to altered endothelin signaling and influence the response to endothelin receptor antagonist therapy in PAH in light of pharmacogenetics. This review will summarize the role of ET-1 within major cardiovascular pathologies and discuss endothelin receptor polymorphisms with special emphasis on potential therapeutic and screening implications.	398	411	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
There is a clear need for drug treatments to be selected according to the characteristics of an individual patient, in order to improve efficacy and reduce the number and severity of adverse drug reactions. One of the main enzymes to take into account in pharmacogenomics is catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), which catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine to catechols and catecholamines, like the neurotransmitters dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Although, most of this enzyme is associated to intracellular vesicles, recently it has also been detected in extracellular vesicles secreted by hepatocytes and in serum circulating vesicles. COMT has implications in many neurological and psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, chronic fatigue, pain response, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorders. Remarkably, genetic variations of COMT affect its activity and are associated to various human disorders from psychiatric diseases to estrogen-induced cancers. Consequently, the establishment of new methods to evaluate COMT activity is an important aspect to investigate the biology of this drug-metabolizing enzyme. Herein, we have developed a sensitive and selective method to determine COMT activity. We first optimized the activity in rat liver incubated with two different substrates; norepinephrine and dopamine. The enzymatically formed products (normetanephrine and 3-methoxytyramine, respectively) were extracted by solid-phase extraction using weak cation exchange cartridges, chromatographically separated, and detected and quantified using a mass spectrometer. The range of quantitation for both products was from 0.005 to 25 μg/mL. This methodology offers acceptable recovery for both enzymatic products (≥75%) and good accuracy and precision (≤15%). The lower limit of quantifications were 0.01 and 0.005 μM for 3-methoxytyramine and normetanephrine, respectively. Importantly, this sensitive assay was able to detect the presence of COMT activity in extracellular vesicles secreted by hepatocytes supporting a potential role of these vesicles in catecholamines and catecholestrogens metabolisms. In addition, the presence of COMT activity in extracellular vesicles opens new possibilities to develop tools to evaluate personalized drug response in a low invasive manner.	542	564	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular vesicles
Ocular inflammatory disorders encompass uveitis, scleritis, keratitis, and other ocular diseases where inflammation may play a role. Although age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is clinically characterized by degenerative changes in the macula, accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Pharmacogenetics is the study of the influence of genetic variation and its effects on drug efficacy or toxicity. There are no pharmacogenetic studies in uveitis and very few in AMD therapies. In this review, the authors describe the susceptibility genes related to uveitis and AMD and the important advances in pharmacogenetic research in relation to AMD and uveitis therapy. They propose polygenic and composite models of treatment responses to fulfill individualized drug therapy in intraocular inflammatory disorders.	828	852	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intraocular inflammatory
Ten years ago, a consensus report on the optimization of tacrolimus was published in this journal. In 2017, the Immunosuppressive Drugs Scientific Committee of the International Association of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicity (IATDMCT) decided to issue an updated consensus report considering the most relevant advances in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacogenetics (PG), pharmacodynamics, and immunologic biomarkers, with the aim to provide analytical and drug-exposure recommendations to assist TDM professionals and clinicians to individualize tacrolimus TDM and treatment. The consensus is based on in-depth literature searches regarding each topic that is addressed in this document. Thirty-seven international experts in the field of TDM of tacrolimus as well as its PG and biomarkers contributed to the drafting of sections most relevant for their expertise. Whenever applicable, the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations were graded according to a published grading guide. After iterated editing, the final version of the complete document was approved by all authors. For each category of solid organ and stem cell transplantation, the current state of PK monitoring is discussed and the specific targets of tacrolimus trough concentrations (predose sample C0) are presented for subgroups of patients along with the grading of these recommendations. In addition, tacrolimus area under the concentration-time curve determination is proposed as the best TDM option early after transplantation, at the time of immunosuppression minimization, for special populations, and specific clinical situations. For indications other than transplantation, the potentially effective tacrolimus concentrations in systemic treatment are discussed without formal grading. The importance of consistency, calibration, proficiency testing, and the requirement for standardization and need for traceability and reference materials is highlighted. The status for alternative approaches for tacrolimus TDM is presented including dried blood spots, volumetric absorptive microsampling, and the development of intracellular measurements of tacrolimus. The association between CYP3A5 genotype and tacrolimus dose requirement is consistent (Grading A I). So far, pharmacodynamic and immunologic biomarkers have not entered routine monitoring, but determination of residual nuclear factor of activated T cells-regulated gene expression supports the identification of renal transplant recipients at risk of rejection, infections, and malignancy (B II). In addition, monitoring intracellular T-cell IFN-g production can help to identify kidney and liver transplant recipients at high risk of acute rejection (B II) and select good candidates for immunosuppression minimization (B II). Although cell-free DNA seems a promising biomarker of acute donor injury and to assess the minimally effective C0 of tacrolimus, multicenter prospective interventional studies are required to better evaluate its clinical utility in solid organ transplantation. Population PK models including CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 genotypes will be considered to guide initial tacrolimus dosing. Future studies should investigate the clinical benefit of time-to-event models to better evaluate biomarkers as predictive of personal response, the risk of rejection, and graft outcome. The Expert Committee concludes that considerable advances in the different fields of tacrolimus monitoring have been achieved during this last decade. Continued efforts should focus on the opportunities to implement in clinical routine the combination of new standardized PK approaches with PG, and valid biomarkers to further personalize tacrolimus therapy and to improve long-term outcomes for treated patients.	2136	2149	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular

The alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine is often used to treat hypotension during anesthesia. In clinical situations, low blood pressure may require prompt intervention by intravenous bolus or infusion.

We aim to evaluate the influence of covariates, including cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) genetic polymorphisms, on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (MDZ) in Asian cancer patients, using a population pharmacokinetic approach. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 24 adult cancer patients who received an intravenous bolus dose of 1 mg MDZ as a CYP3A phenotyping probe, 1-day before starting FOLFIRI chemotherapy. Concentrations of MDZ and its major metabolites, 1'-hydroxymidazolam (1OHM) and 1'-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide (HMG) were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The population pharmacokinetic study was conducted using NONMEM. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and genetic polymorphisms were screened as covariates. A two-compartment model for MDZ and two sequential compartments representing 1OHM and HMG best described the data. The CYP3A5*3 and total bilirubin level significantly influenced MDZ clearance. The population typical MDZ clearance for CYP3A5*3 expressers was 22% lower than non-expressers. Baseline bodyweight was a statistically significant covariate for clearance and distribution volume of 1OHM. Creatinine clearance was positively correlated with HMG clearance. Our data indicate that CYP3A5*3, total bilirubin, bodyweight, and creatinine clearance are important predictors of MDZ and metabolite pharmacokinetics. Further studies in more patients are needed to explore the links between the identified covariates and the disposition of MDZ and its metabolites.	303	314	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous
Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease. Genetic factors play an essential role in contributing to bone mineral density (BMD) variability, which ranges from 60 to 85%.

Statins are the most commonly prescribed cardiovascular disease drug, but their inter-individual efficacy varies considerably. Genetic factors uncovered to date have only explained a small proportion of variation in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) lowering. To identify novel markers and determinants of statin response, we used whole transcriptome sequence data collected from simvastatin and control incubated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from participants of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) simvastatin clinical trial. We looked for genes whose statin-induced expression changes were most different between LCLs derived from individuals with high versus low plasma LDLC statin response during the CAP trial. We created a classification model of 82 "signature" gene expression changes that distinguished high versus low LDLC statin response. One of the most differentially changing genes was zinc finger protein 542 pseudogene (ZNF542P), the signature gene with changes most correlated with statin-induced change in cellular cholesterol ester, an in vitro marker of statin response. ZNF542P knock-down in a human hepatoma cell line increased intracellular cholesterol ester levels upon simvastatin treatment. Together, these findings imply a role for ZNF542P in LDLC response to simvastatin and, importantly, highlight the potential significance of noncoding RNAs as a contributing factor to variation in drug response.	1182	1220	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular cholesterol ester levels
After percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), clopidogrel resistant patients are at an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs).

<b>Background:</b> Currently, the first line treatment of persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is either indomethacin or ibuprofen. However, the potentially life-threatening side effects associated to their use have prompted physicians to look for alternative options. The incorporation of paracetamol as an alternative to ibuprofen in the management of PDA is still based on insufficient clinical evidence. Hence, more clinical trials are needed to establish a therapeutic role for paracetamol in the management of PDA that take into consideration short- and long-term safety and efficacy outcomes. <b>Study Design:</b> This is a non-inferiority, randomized, multicenter, double-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy, and safety of intravenous (IV) paracetamol vs. IV ibuprofen (standard treatment) for PDA in preterm patients with a gestational age ≤ 30 weeks. At baseline, patients will be randomized (1:1) to treatment with paracetamol or ibuprofen. The primary endpoint is closure of the ductus after the first treatment course. Secondary endpoints are related to effectiveness (need for a second treatment course, rescue treatment, reopening rate, time to definitive closure, need for surgical ligation), safety (early and long-term complications), pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, pharmacogenetics, pharmacoeconomics, and genotoxicity. Long-term follow-up to 24 months of corrected postnatal age will be performed using Bayley III neurodevelopmental scale. <b>Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04037514.

Asthmatic patients show a large heterogeneity in response to asthma medication. Rapidly evolving genotyping technologies have led to the identification of various genetic variants associated with treatment outcomes. Areas covered: This review focuses on the current knowledge of genetic variants influencing treatment response to the most commonly used asthma medicines: short- and long-acting beta-2 agonists (SABA/LABA), inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene modifiers. This review shows that various genetic variants have been identified, but none are currently used to guide asthma treatment. One of the most promising genetic variants is the Arg16 variant in the ADRB2 gene to guide LABA treatment in asthmatic children. Expert commentary: Poor replication of initially promising results and the low fraction of variability accounted for by single genetic variants inhibit pharmacogenetic findings to reach the asthma clinic. Nevertheless, the identification of genetic variation influencing treatment response does provide more insights in the complex processes underlying response and might identify novel targets for treatment. There is a need to report measures of clinical validity, to perform precision-medicine guided trials, as well as to understand how genetic variation interacts with environmental factors. In addition, systems biology approaches might be able to show a more complete picture of these complex interactions.	382	409	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	long-acting beta-2 agonists

Significant individual susceptibility to intravenous anesthetic propofol exists. The etiology of individual variability in the response to propofol may be influenced by genetic polymorphisms in metabolic and functional pathways. With current pharmacogenetics and modern molecular biology technologies, it is possible to study the influence of genetic polymorphisms on susceptibility to propofol. When inducing general anesthesia with intravenous propofol, high individual susceptibility to propofol was found. Using Sequenom MassARRAY single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, we identified a mutation (rs6313) in the 5HT2A gene that was correlated to individual susceptibility to propofol effect-site concentration (Cep) and onset time of propofol induction. Carriers of the minor allele (G) of 5HT2A rs6313 required less propofol (20% decrease in Cep) and less time (40% decrease in onset time) to induce anesthesia. Moreover, associations were found between the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor SNP rs2279020 and the SCN9A SNP rs6746030 and the susceptibility of bispectral index (BIS) after propofol-induced anesthesia. In addition, dominant mutations in GABAA1 rs2279020, GABAA2 rs11503014, and CHRM2 rs1824024 were putatively associated with cardiovascular susceptibility to propofol anesthesia. No gene-gene interactions were found through a standardized measure of linkage disequilibrium and a multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis. Our results suggest that genetic polymorphisms related to mechanisms of propofol anesthesia are involved in propofol susceptibility.	41	52	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous

Tacrolimus is the gold standard immunosuppressant administered in solid organ and stem cell transplantation to avoid graft rejection post-transplant. Despite its widespread use, there is a large variation in response to therapy, likely due to high inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability. Therapeutic drug monitoring is employed to improve clinical response and reduce toxicity. There is substantial evidence that pharmacogenetics influences drug exposure and response. <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype significantly impacts oral tacrolimus concentrations and response after solid organ transplantation. There are fewer studies in stem cell transplantation and with intravenous tacrolimus dosing. This report highlights recent evidence suggesting genes such as <i>CYP3A4</i> and <i>ABCB1</i> play a larger role after intravenous dosing compared with <i>CYP3A5</i>, and the role for novel genes on tacrolimus outcomes.	812	823	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous

Opioid-related respiratory depression (RD) is a serious clinical problem as it causes multiple deaths and anoxic brain injuries. Morphine is subject to efflux via P-glycoprotein transporter encoded by ABCB1, also known as MDR1. ABCB1 polymorphisms may affect blood-brain barrier transport of morphine and therefore individual response to its central analgesic and adverse effects. This study aimed to determine specific associations between common ABCB1 genetic variants and clinically important outcomes including RD and RD resulting in prolonged stay in hospital with intravenous morphine in a homogenous pediatric surgical pain population of 263 children undergoing tonsillectomy. Children with GG and GA genotypes of ABCB1 polymorphism rs9282564 had higher risks of RD resulting in prolonged hospital stays; adding one copy of the minor allele (G) increased the odds of prolonged hospital stay due to postoperative RD by 4.7-fold (95% confidence interval: 2.1-10.8, P=0.0002).	570	595	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous morphine in a
Although the majority of individuals with hypertension (HTN) have primary and polygenic HTN, monogenic HTN is a secondary type that is widely thought to play a key role in pediatric HTN, which has the characteristics of early onset, refractory HTN with a positive family history, and electrolyte disorders. Monogenic HTN results from single genetic mutations that contribute to the dysregulation of blood pressure (BP) in the kidneys and adrenal glands. It is pathophysiologically associated with increased sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule, intravascular volume expansion, and HTN, as well as low renin and varying aldosterone levels. Simultaneously increased or decreased potassium levels also provide clues for the diagnosis of monogenic HTN. Discovering the genetic factors that cause an increase in BP has been shown to be related to the choice of and responses to antihypertensive medications. Therefore, early and precise diagnosis with genetic sequencing and effective treatment with accurate antihypertensive agents are critical in the management of monogenic HTN. In addition, understanding the genetic architecture of BP, causative molecular pathways perturbing BP regulation, and pharmacogenomics can help with the selection of precision and personalized medicine, as well as improve morbidity and mortality in adulthood.	549	562	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravascular
Labor initiates one of the most intensely painful episodes in a woman's life. Opioids are used to provide analgesia with substantial interindividual variability in efficacy. mu-Opioid receptor (muOR, OPRM1) genetic variants may explain differences in response to opioid analgesia. We hypothesized that OPRM1 304A/G polymorphism influences the median effective dose (ED(50)) of intrathecal fentanyl via combined spinal-epidural for labor analgesia. Nulliparous women were prospectively recruited around 35 weeks gestation (n=224), and genotyped for 304A/G polymorphism. Those requesting neuraxial labor analgesia were enrolled in one of the two double-blinded trials: up-down sequential allocation (SA, n=50) and a separate confirmatory random-dose allocation trial (RA, n=97). Effective analgesia from intrathecal fentanyl was defined by >or=60 min analgesia with verbal rating score <or=1 (scale 0-10) and was compared between mu OR 304A homozygotes (Group A) and women carrying at least one 304G allele (Group G). OPRM1 304G allele frequency f(-) was 0.18. Using SA, intrathecal fentanyl ED(50) was 26.8 microg (95% CI 22.7-30.9) in Group A and 17.7 microg (95% CI 13.4-21.9) in Group G (p<0.001; 304A homozygosity increased the ED(50) 1.5-fold). RA confirmed that 304A homozygosity significantly increases intrathecal fentanyl ED(50) (27.4 microg in Group A and 12.8 microg in Group G [p<0.002; 2.1-fold]). We demonstrate for the first time that the muOR 304G variant significantly reduces intrathecal fentanyl ED(50) for labor analgesia, suggesting women with the G variant may be more responsive to opioids and require less analgesic drugs. These findings for intrathecal fentanyl pharmacogenetics may have implications for patients receiving opioids in other settings.	411	426	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	spinal-epidural
Bevacizumab is used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, there are still no available predictors of clinical outcomes. We investigated selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes involved in VEGF-dependent and -independent angiogenesis pathways and other major intracellular signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of mCRC as an attempt to find predictors of clinical outcome. Forty-six patients treated with first-line bevacizumab-based chemotherapy were included in this study with a 5 year follow up. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood for the analysis of <i>VEGF-A</i> (rs2010963, 1570360, rs699947), <i>ICAM-1</i> (rs5498, rs1799969) SNPs and from tumor tissue for the detection of genomic variants in <i>KRAS</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>BRAF</i> genes. PCR and next generation sequencing were used for the analysis. The endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The <i>VEGF-A</i> rs699947 A/A allele was associated with increased PFS (<i>p</i> = 0.006) and OS (<i>p</i> = 0.043). The <i>ICAM-1</i> rs1799969 G/A allele was associated with prolonged OS (<i>p</i> = 0.036). Finally, <i>BRAF</i> wild type was associated with increased OS (<i>p</i> = 0.027). We identified <i>VEGF-A</i> and <i>ICAM-1</i> variants in angiogenesis and other major intracellular signaling pathways, such as <i>BRAF</i>, that can predict clinical outcome upon bevacizumab administration.

We investigated selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes involved in VEGF-dependent and -independent angiogenesis pathways and other major intracellular signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of mCRC as an attempt to find predictors of clinical outcome. Forty-six patients treated with first-line bevacizumab-based chemotherapy were included in this study with a 5 year follow up. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood for the analysis of <i>VEGF-A</i> (rs2010963, 1570360, rs699947), <i>ICAM-1</i> (rs5498, rs1799969) SNPs and from tumor tissue for the detection of genomic variants in <i>KRAS</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>BRAF</i> genes. PCR and next generation sequencing were used for the analysis. The endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The <i>VEGF-A</i> rs699947 A/A allele was associated with increased PFS (<i>p</i> = 0.006) and OS (<i>p</i> = 0.043). The <i>ICAM-1</i> rs1799969 G/A allele was associated with prolonged OS (<i>p</i> = 0.036). Finally, <i>BRAF</i> wild type was associated with increased OS (<i>p</i> = 0.027). We identified <i>VEGF-A</i> and <i>ICAM-1</i> variants in angiogenesis and other major intracellular signaling pathways, such as <i>BRAF</i>, that can predict clinical outcome upon bevacizumab administration. These identified biomarkers could be used to select patients with mCRC who may achieve long-term responses and benefit from bevacizumab-based therapies.	1337	1350	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the standard of care is dual antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) and aspirin. Current clinical practice guidelines now recommend more potent P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors (prasugrel or ticagrelor) over clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, clopidogrel remains the most commonly prescribed P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor in the setting of PCI and is also the preferred agent in the treatment and secondary prevention of stroke. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires bioactivation by the CYP2C19 enzyme. It has been shown that clopidogrel use in patients who are CYP2C19 no function allele carriers are associated with impaired antiplatelet inhibition and a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Compared to clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor clinical response is not impacted by CYP2C19 genotype. Even with a demonstrated increased risk of adverse outcomes in CYP2C19 no function allele carriers treated with clopidogrel, routine implementation of CYP2C19 genotyping to guide antiplatelet therapy selection has remained controversial and has not been widely adopted. Recent results from multiple prospective randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials investigating the use of CYP2C19 genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy following PCI have advanced the evidence base demonstrating the clinical utility of this strategy. Multiple recent studies have examined the effects of CYP2C19 genotype on clopidogrel outcomes in the setting of stroke and neurointerventional procedures. In this review, we discern the clinical utility of using CYP2C19 genotype testing to guide antiplatelet therapy prescribing by evaluating the impact of CYP2C19 genotype-guided selection of antiplatelet therapy on clinical outcomes, summarizing emerging data from cardiovascular and neurology clinical studies, and discussing implications for clinical practice guidelines, remaining knowledge gaps and future research directions.	840	855	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	cerebrovascular
The neurological practice suffered considerable changes during the last twenty years. The recent therapeutic methods and the acceptance of the ideology of evidence based medicine, which is based on confidence in statistics, changed the reasoning of the neurologists. Therapy protocols intrude into the field of individual medicine, and doctors accept treatment schemes to alleviate responsibility of their decisions. In contrast with this, recent achievements in pharmacogenetics emphasize the importance of individual drug therapies. The protocol of intravenous cerebral thrombolysis does not require defining the origin of cerebral ischaemia in the acute stage, therefore, this procedure can be regarded as human experiment. According to the strict protocol thrombolysis might be indicated only in 1-8% of patients with cerebral ischaemia. According to the Cohrane database more trials are needed to clarify which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment. Because of the change in therapeutic principles transient ischaemic attack has been newly defined as "acute neurovascular syndrome". Multiplication of neurological subspecialties has been facilitated by the development of diagnostic tools and the discovery of effective new drugs. The specialization led to narrowing of interest and competency of clinicians. Several new neurological scientific societies were founded for the representation of specific disorders. In Hungary, between 1993 and 2000 nine scientific societies were grounded within the field of clinical neurology. These societies should be thankful to the pharmaceutical industries for their existence. In some European countries in 2007 only three neurological subspecialties were accepted, which are neurophysiology, neuro-rehabilitation and child-neurology. Neuro-radiology is in the hands of general radiologists, the specialization is not granted for neurologists. Because of the subspecialization the general professionalism of neurologists has diminished. Among young neurologists the propedeutic skills suffered most seriously. Subspecialisation of teachers also interferes with the practice oriented teaching of medical students and residents.	551	571	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous cerebral
Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a well established but complex treatment option for malignant and non-malignant disorders in pediatric patients. Most commonly used myeloablative and non-myeloablative conditioning regimens in children comprise alkylating agents, such as busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide. Inter-individual variability in the pharmacokinetics of BU can result in altered conditioning of the patient and therefore lead to relapse or rejection due to under exposures, or occurrence of toxicities due to over exposures. With the introduction of the intravenous formulation of BU, this variability has been reduced but still cannot be fully predicted. Inter and intra-individual variability of BU kinetics is more common in children compared to adults and toxicity of BU based regimens is still a concern. It has been hypothesized that some of this variability in BU pharmacokinetics and treatment outcomes, especially the toxicity, might be predicted by genetic variants of enzymes involved in the metabolism of BU. This review intends to summarize the studies performed to date on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of BU based conditioning, specifically in relation to children.	590	601	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous
Sofosbuvir (SOF) is an HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor, and GS-331007 is its major metabolite. The aim of this study was to investigate whether clinical and pharmacological factors could influence GS-331007 intracellular (IC) concentrations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) associated with a sustained virological response in patients treated with SOF and ribavirin (RBV). Drug levels were analyzed using liquid chromatography at different days of therapy, whereas variants in genes encoding transporters and nuclear factors were investigated using real-time PCR. This study enrolled 245 patients treated with SOF; 245 samples were analyzed for pharmacogenetics and 50 were analyzed for IC pharmacokinetics. The GS-331007 IC concentration at 30 days was associated with its plasma concentration determinate at 30, 60 and 90 days of SOF-therapy and with daclatasvir concentrations at 7 days of therapy. No genetic polymorphism affected IC exposure. In linear multivariate analysis, ledipasvir treatment, baseline albumin and estimated glomerular filtration rate were significant predictors of IC exposure. This study presents data on an IC evaluation in a cohort of patients treated with SOF, also considering pharmacogenetics. These results could be useful for regions where SOF-RBV treatment is considered the standard of care; moreover, they could further deepen the knowledge of IC exposure for similar drugs in the future.	205	218	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
The human genome encodes nine different adrenoceptor genes. These are grouped into three families, namely, the α1-, α2-, and β-adrenoceptors, with three family members each. Adrenoceptors are expressed by most cell types of the human body and are primary targets of the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine that are released from the sympathetic nervous system during its activation. Upon catecholamine binding, adrenoceptors change conformation, couple to and activate G proteins, and thereby initiate various intracellular signaling cascades. As the primary receivers and transducers of sympathetic activation, adrenoceptors have a central role in human physiology and disease and are important targets for widely used drugs. All nine adrenoceptor subtypes display substantial genetic variation, both in their coding sequence as well as in adjacent regions. Despite the fact that some of the adrenoceptor variants range among the most frequently studied genetic variants assessed in pharmacogenetics to date, their functional relevance remains ill defined in many cases. A substantial fraction of the associations reported from early candidate gene approaches have not subsequently been confirmed in different cohorts or in genome-wide association studies, which have increasingly been conducted in recent years. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of all adrenoceptor variants that have reproducibly been detected in the larger genome sequencing efforts. We evaluate these variants with respect to the modulation of receptor function and expression and discuss their role in physiology and disease.	520	533	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
Pre-mRNA splicing in the information exchange from DNA to protein is a critical step in all eukaryotes. However, there is currently a lack of noninvasive approaches for monitoring mRNA splicing events in cells. In this study, we presented a genetically encoded bioluminescence reporter, Rluc-intron, for noninvasive real-time monitoring the pre-mRNA splicing process in living cells and animals. It was designed by inserting a renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene into an intron sequence manipulated by RNA splicing modulator. We demonstrated that the splicing reporter Rluc-intron could provide real-time and quantitative information on the splicing activity responded to extracellular stimuli in living cells. In addition, Rluc-intron reporter is able to successfully quantify and image the pre-mRNA splicing in living mice in a noninvasive and longitudinal manner. This bioluminescence reporter provides the advantageous properties of systematic discovery of splicing modulators, which give the advances in pharmacogenomics and would produce new approach in the therapy of human diseases caused by splicing disorder.	667	680	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	extracellular
Orexin neurons in the hypothalamus regulate energy homeostasis by coordinating various physiological responses. Past studies have shown the role of the orexin peptide itself; however, orexin neurons contain not only orexin but also other neurotransmitters such as glutamate and dynorphin. In this study, we examined the physiological role of orexin neurons in feeding behavior and metabolism by pharmacogenetic activation and chronic ablation. We generated novel orexin-Cre mice and utilized Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus vectors to express Gq-coupled modified GPCR, hM3Dq or diphtheria toxin fragment A in orexin neurons. By intraperitoneal injection of clozapine-N oxide in orexin-Cre mice expressing hM3Dq in orexin neurons, we could selectively manipulate the activity of orexin neurons. Pharmacogenetic stimulation of orexin neurons simultaneously increased locomotive activity, food intake, water intake and the respiratory exchange ratio (RER). Elevation of blood glucose levels and RER persisted even after locomotion and feeding behaviors returned to basal levels. Accordantly, 83% ablation of orexin neurons resulted in decreased food and water intake, while 70% ablation had almost no effect on these parameters. Our results indicate that orexin neurons play an integral role in regulation of both feeding behavior and metabolism. This regulation is so robust that greater than 80% of orexin neurons were ablated before significant changes in feeding behavior emerged.	633	648	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intraperitoneal
Most gastric cancer (GC) subtypes are identified through transcriptional profiling overlooking dynamic changes and interactions in gene expression. Based on the background network of global immune genes, we constructed sample-specific edge-perturbation matrices and identified four molecular network subtypes of GC (MNG). MNG-1 displayed the best prognosis and vigorous cell cycle activity. MNG-2 was enriched by immune-hot phenotype with the potential for immunotherapy response. MNG-3 and MNG-4 were identified with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) peculiarity and worse prognosis, termed EMT subtypes. MNG-3 was characterized by low mutational burden and stromal cells and considered a replica of previous subtypes associated with poor prognosis. Notably, MNG-4 was considered a previously undefined subtype with a dismal prognosis, characterized by chromosomal instability and immune-desert microenvironment. This subtype tended to metastasize and was resistant to respond to immunotherapy. Pharmacogenomics analysis showed three therapeutic agents (NVP-BEZ235, LY2606368, and rutin) were potential interventions for MNG-4.	888	901	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	immune-desert
Acetaminophen is gaining importance as a first-line drug for treating patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in neonates. Predominant metabolites of acetaminophen in preterm neonates vary from that of adults; and the drug is predominantly metabolised by conjugation and partly by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.We carried out the present study to identify the principal urine metabolites of acetaminophen (glucuronide/sulphate) in preterm neonates with hemodynamically significant PDA receiving intravenous acetaminophen, and to evaluate the prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the key CYP enzymes (<i>CYP1A2*3</i>, <i>CYP1A2*4</i>, <i>CYP1A2*1C, CYP1A2*1K, CYP1A2*6</i>, <i>CYP2D6*10, CYP2E1*2</i>, <i>CYP2E1*5B, CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A4*2</i>, <i>CYP3A4*3</i>, <i>CYP3A5*3, CYP3A5*7,</i> and <i>CYP3A5*11</i>) and their effect on urinary metabolites and serum acetaminophen concentrations.Nineteen (32.8%) neonates had heterozygous <i>CYP1A2*1C</i>, two (3.3%) with heterozygous <i>CYP1A2*1K</i>, 15 (27.8%) and two (3.7%) had heterozygous and homozygous <i>CYP2D6*10</i>, two (3.7%) had heterozygous <i>CYP2E1*5B</i>, seven (12.3%) and three (5.3%) had heterozygous and homozygous <i>CYP3A4*1B</i>, and three (5.5%) had <i>CYP3A5*7</i> amongst the study population. Acetaminophen sulphate predominated over glucuronide metabolite at all time points. Postnatal days of life was significantly associated with an increase in the urine acetaminophen metabolites with decreased serum acetaminophen concentrations.A significant prevalence of SNPs in the key CYP enzymes related to acetaminophen metabolism was observed in our neonatal population. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling incorporating genetic and metabolite data is urgently needed for implementation of precision medicine in this vulnerable population.	486	511	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous acetaminophen
<sup>14</sup> C-labeled YH4808, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, was intravenously administered as a microtracer at 80 μg (11.8 kBq or 320 nCi) concomitantly with the nonradiolabeled oral drug at 200 mg to determine the absolute bioavailability and to assess the effect of pharmacogenomics on the oral absorption of YH4808. The absolute bioavailability was low and highly variable (mean, 10.1%; range, 2.3-19.3%), and M3 and M8, active metabolites of YH4808, were formed 22.6- and 38.5-fold higher after oral administration than intravenous administration, respectively. The product of the fraction of an oral YH4808 dose entering the gut wall and the fraction of YH4808 passing on to the portal circulation was larger in subjects carrying the variants of the CHST3, SLC15A1, and SULT1B1 genes. A combined LC+AMS is a useful tool to construct a rich and highly informative pharmacokinetic knowledge core in early clinical drug development at a reasonable cost.	80	93	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenously

Heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors are the most diverse and therapeutically important family of receptors, playing major roles in the physiology of various organs and tissues. They couple their ligand binding to G-protein activation, which then transmits intracellular signals. G-protein signaling is terminated by phosphorylation of the receptor by the family of G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), followed by arrestin (Arr) binding, which uncouples the phosphorylated receptor from the G-protein and subsequently targets the receptor for internalization. Moreover, Arrs can transmit signals in their own right during receptor internalization. Genetic polymorphisms in receptors, as well as in GRK and Arr family members per se, which affect regulation of receptor signaling and function, have just started being identified and characterized. The present review will discuss what is known so far in this evolving field of GRK/Arr pharmacogenomics, as well as highlight important areas likely to produce invaluable information in the future.	261	274	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
Genetic factors play a significant but complex role in antidepressant (AD) response and tolerability. During recent years, there is growing enthusiasm in the promise of pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic (PGx) tools for optimizing and personalizing treatment outcomes for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The influence of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genes on response and tolerability has been investigated, including those encoding the cytochrome P450 superfamily, P-glycoprotein, monoaminergic transporters and receptors, intracellular signal transduction pathways, and the stress hormone system. Genome-wide association studies are also identifying new genetic variants associated with AD response phenotypes, which, combined with methods such as polygenic risk scores (PRS), is opening up new avenues for novel personalized treatment approaches for MDD. This chapter describes the basic concepts in PGx of AD response, reviews the major pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genes involved in AD outcome, discusses PRS as a promising approach for predicting AD efficacy and tolerability, and addresses key challenges to the development and application of PGx tests.	543	556	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular
Since over 50 years, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is in use as backbone of chemotherapy treatment regimens for a wide range of cancers including colon, breast, and head and neck carcinomas. However, drug resistance and severe toxicities such as mucositis, diarrhea, neutropenia, and vomiting in up to 40% of treated patients often lead to dose limitation or treatment discontinuation. Because the oral bioavailability of 5-FU is unpredictable and highly variable, 5-FU is commonly administered intravenously. To overcome medical complications and inconvenience associated with intravenous administration, the oral prodrugs capecitabine and tegafur have been developed. Both fluoropyrimidines are metabolically converted intracellularly to 5-FU, which then needs metabolic activation to exert its damaging activity on RNA and DNA. The low response rates of 10-15% of 5-FU monotherapy can be improved by combination regimens of infusional 5-FU and leucovorin together with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI), thereby increasing response rates to 30-40%. The impact of metabolizing enzymes in the development of fluoropyrimidine toxicity and resistance has been studied in great detail. In addition, membrane drug transporters, which are critical determinants of intracellular drug concentrations, may play a role in occurrence of toxicity and development of resistance against fluoropyrimidine-based therapy as well. This review therefore summarizes current knowledge on the role of drug transporters with particular focus on ATP-binding cassette transporters in fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy response.	570	581	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key membrane-embedded receptor proteins, with critical roles in cellular signal transduction. In the era of precision medicine, understanding the role of natural variants on GPCR function is critical, especially from a pharmacogenomics viewpoint. Studies involved in mapping variants to GPCR structures are briefly reviewed here. The endocannabinoid system involving the central nervous system (CNS), the human cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), is an important drug target and its variability has implications for disease susceptibility and altered drug and pain response. We have carried out a computational study to map deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) to CB1. CB1 mutations were computationally evaluated from neutral to deleterious, and the top twelve deleterious mutations, with structural information, were found to be either close to the ligand binding region or the G-protein binding site. We have mapped these to the active and inactive CB1 X-ray crystallographic structures to correlate variants with available phenotypic information. We have also carried out molecular dynamics simulations to functionally characterize four selected mutants.	104	112	CELL	cellular
A postulated role of subcortical neuromodulators is to control brain states. Mechanisms by which different neuromodulators compete or cooperate at various temporal scales remain an open question. We investigated the interaction of acetylcholine (ACh) and oxytocin (OXT) at slow and fast timescales during various brain states. Although these neuromodulators fluctuated in parallel during NREM packets, transitions from NREM to REM were characterized by a surge of ACh but a continued decrease of OXT. OXT signaling lagged behind ACh. High ACh was correlated with population synchrony and gamma oscillations during active waking, whereas minimum ACh predicts sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs). Optogenetic control of ACh and OXT neurons confirmed the active role of these neuromodulators in the observed correlations. Synchronous hippocampal activity consistently reduced OXT activity, whereas inactivation of the lateral septum-hypothalamus path attenuated this effect. Our findings demonstrate how cooperative actions of these neuromodulators allow target circuits to perform specific functions.	231	244	CELL	acetylcholine

Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR) is a kind of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs). PDGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) which are small molecule inhibitors targeting PDGFR prevent and block cell proliferation signal transduction pathways. Recently, there have been 11 TKIs (including imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib and ponatinib) targeting PDGFR approved by FDA for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, renal cell carcinoma et al. Pharmacokinetics (PK) reflects the processes of drugs in body, while pharmacodynamics (PD) reflects the efficacy. Genetic polymorphisms of metabolizers and transporters contribute to highly inter-individual variability in PK and PD. This review aims to introduce the clinical applications, instruction and usage, PK, PD and pharmacogenetics of these PDGFR TKIs.	205	209	CELL	cell
Vinblastine and vincristine are dimeric indole alkaloids derived from Catharanthus roseus (formerly: Vinca rosea). Their monomeric precursor molecules are vindoline and catharanthine. While vinblastine and vincristine are well-known mitotic spindle poisons, not much is known about vindoline and catharanthine. Vindoline and catharanthine showed weak cytotoxicity, while vinblastine, vincristine, and the semisynthetic vindesine and vinorelbine revealed high cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. This may reflect a general biological principle of poisonous plants. Highly toxic compounds are not only active towards predators, but also towards plant tissues. Hence, plants need mechanisms to protect themselves from their own poisons. One evolutionary strategy to solve this problem is to generate less toxic precursors, which are dimerized to toxic end products when needed. As shown by in silico molecular docking and biochemical approaches, vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine bound with high affinity to α/β-tubulin and inhibited tubulin polymerization, whereas the effects of vindoline and catharanthine were weak. Similarly, vinblastine produced high fractions of mono- and multipolar mitotic spindles, while vindoline and catharanthine did only weakly affect bipolar mitotic spindle formation. Here, we show that vinblastine contributes to cell death by interference with spindle polarity. P-glycoprotein-overexpressing multidrug-resistant CEM/VCR1000 cells were highly resistant towards vincristine and cross-resistant to vinblastine, vindesine, and vinorelbine, but not or only weakly cross-resistant to vindoline and catharanthine. In addition to tubulin as primary target, microarray-based mRNA signatures of responsiveness of these compounds have been identified by COMPARE and signaling pathway profiling.	70	89	CELL	Catharanthus roseus

Recent studies have been established high degree of genetic diversity in solid organ tumors among individuals and even between individual tumor cells. This intratumor and intertumor genetic diversity results in a heterogeneous tumor with unique characteristics which potentially allows effective drug therapy. The goal of pharmacogenomics is to elucidate the genetic network(s) that underlie drug efficacy and drug resistance. Advances in targeted and personalized therapy play an increasingly important role in many common cancers, notably lung cancer, due to the high incidence, prevalence, mortality and the greater tendency towards drug resistance seen in these patients. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and or downstream kinase pathways. This has led to the development of highly selective monoclonal antibodies and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) to prevent cancer initiation, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, survival, and invasion. However, resistance to many of these new treatments is induced and further pharmacogenomic analysis has revealed mutations associated with increased or reduced drug efficacy. Combinations of kinase inhibitors or potentially the targeting of cancer stem cells may further increase the success of pharmacogenomics in treating patients with lung cancer.	138	149	CELL	tumor cells

To document determinants of O-demethylation in critically ill (pre)term neonates and infants, tramadol (M) and O-demethyl tramadol (M1) concentrations were quantified in eighty-six 24 h urine collections and 168 plasma samples. A significant correlation of urine log M/M1 (0.98, SD 0.66) and plasma log M/M1 (0.78, SD 0.45) with postmenstrual age (PMA) (r = -0.69 and -0.65) was observed. One-way analysis of variance documented a significant decrease in urine log and plasma log M/M1 with increasing CYP2D6 activity score (F value 11.6 and 22.55). PMA and CYP2D6 activity score determined the urine and plasma log M/M1 (R 0.59 and 0.64) in a forward multiple regression model. We therefore conclude that PMA and CYP2D6 polymorphisms determined O-demethylation activity in (pre)term neonates and young infants, illustrating the impact of pharmacogenetics on drug metabolism in neonates although a relevant part of the interindividual varaibility remained unexplained. Besides compound-specific relevance, CYP2D6 iso-enzyme specific data on in vivo ontogeny of O-demethylation can contribute to safer and more effective administration of drugs metabolized by the same route in this population.	132	134	CELL	M1
Effective management of sickle cell pain entails a thorough understanding of its pathophysiology and the pharmacogenomics of the opioids used to manage it. In recent years, there has been significant progress along these two lines. At the pathophysiologic level, there is evidence that the severity and frequency of painful stimuli modulate their transmission at the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This modulation is achieved via two channels: the α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and NMDA receptors. Initially, the AMPA channel controls the transmission of stimuli of mild-moderate severity. Once the AMPA channel reaches its limit of membrane depolarization, the NMDA channel is activated and facilitates the transmission of painful stimuli in a progressive fashion leading to central sensitization and glial activation. At the level of pharmacogenomics, the metabolism of each opioid is patient-specific. Glucuronidation is unique for the metabolism of morphine, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone. The metabolism of all other opioids requires specific Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. The activity of each isoenzyme and the activity of the metabolites of each opioid vary among patients depending on their genetic makeup and coexistent environmental factors such as the use of other medications that may enhance or inhibit the CYP isoenzyme activity.	31	35	CELL	cell

One of the unsolved mysteries of medicine is how do volatile anesthetics (VAs) cause a patient to reversibly lose consciousness. In addition, identifying mechanisms for the collateral effects of VAs, including anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (AiN) and anesthetic preconditioning (AP), has proven challenging. Multiple classes of molecules (lipids, proteins, and water) have been considered as potential VA targets, but recently proteins have received the most attention. Studies targeting neuronal receptors or ion channels had limited success in identifying the critical targets of VAs mediating either the phenotype of "anesthesia" or their collateral effects. Recent studies in both nematodes and fruit flies may provide a paradigm shift by suggesting that mitochondria may harbor the upstream molecular switch activating both primary and collateral effects. The disruption of a specific step of electron transfer within the mitochondrion causes hypersensitivity to VAs, from nematodes to <i>Drosophila</i> and to humans, while also modulating the sensitivity to collateral effects. The downstream effects from mitochondrial inhibition are potentially legion, but inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter cycling appears to be specifically sensitive to the mitochondrial effects. These findings are perhaps of even broader interest since two recent reports indicate that mitochondrial damage may well underlie neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of VAs in the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, important to understand how anesthetics interact with mitochondria to affect CNS function, not just for the desired facets of general anesthesia but also for significant collateral effects, both harmful and beneficial. A tantalizing possibility exists that both the primary (anesthesia) and secondary (AiN, AP) mechanisms may at least partially overlap in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).	490	498	CELL	neuronal
<b>Introduction:</b> Research in the field of pharmacogenomics (PGx) aims to identify genetic variants that modulate response to drugs, through alterations in their pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD). The distribution of PGx variants differs considerably among populations, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) plays a major role as a comprehensive approach to detect both common and rare variants. This study evaluated the frequency of PGx markers in the context of the Brazilian population, using data from a population-based admixed cohort from Sao Paulo, Brazil, which includes variants from WGS of 1,171 unrelated, elderly individuals. <b>Methods:</b> The Stargazer tool was used to call star alleles and structural variants (SVs) from 38 pharmacogenes. Clinically relevant variants were investigated, and the predicted drug response phenotype was analyzed in combination with the medication record to assess individuals potentially at high-risk of gene-drug interaction. <b>Results:</b> In total, 352 unique star alleles or haplotypes were observed, of which 255 and 199 had a frequency < 0.05 and < 0.01, respectively. For star alleles with frequency > 5% (<i>n</i> = 97), decreased, loss-of-function and unknown function accounted for 13.4%, 8.2% and 27.8% of alleles or haplotypes, respectively. Structural variants (SVs) were identified in 35 genes for at least one individual, and occurred with frequencies >5% for CYP2D6, CYP2A6, GSTM1, and UGT2B17. Overall 98.0% of the individuals carried at least one high risk genotype-predicted phenotype in pharmacogenes with PharmGKB level of evidence 1A for drug interaction. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) Priority Result Notation and the cohort medication registry were combined to assess high-risk gene-drug interactions. In general, 42.0% of the cohort used at least one PharmGKB evidence level 1A drug, and 18.9% of individuals who used PharmGKB evidence level 1A drugs had a genotype-predicted phenotype of high-risk gene-drug interaction. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study described the applicability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques for translating PGx variants into clinically relevant phenotypes on a large scale in the Brazilian population and explores the feasibility of systematic adoption of PGx testing in Brazil.	1	2	CELL	b

The majority of patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas have advanced disease at presentation, with only 20% surviving beyond one year. Even among the 10% to 15% of patients who present with localized disease, only 20% will be alive 5 years post surgical resection. Systemic therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma to date has failed to provide more than a very modest survival benefit for patients with advanced disease. However, the past decade has seen significant advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, culminating in the sequencing of the pancreatic cancer genome. New generations of therapeutic agents targeting key oncogenic cellular signaling pathways are currently under evaluation in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Although thus far only erlotinib has been shown to improve survival when compared to gemcitabine monotherapy, the authors anticipate that further developments in biomarker analysis and pharmacogenomics, along with the identification of new drugs will help maximize the benefit of novel therapeutics by directing effective use in the future. Herein the authors review the evidence to date for the use of novel cytotoxic and molecularly targeted agents in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and discuss key areas for future therapeutic development.	688	696	CELL	cellular
Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies. The classical symptoms of FXIII deficiency span from intracranial haemorrhage to delay bleeding or the staying of chronic wounds in the skin including impaired mucosal healing. In this view, FXIII bridges primary haemostasis, coagulation and definite tissue healing. Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing. Accordingly, adequate FXIII levels can drive and predict the prognosis of complex diseases and the outcome of the associated therapies or interventions. In addition, peculiar pharmacogenetics aspects of the FXIII gene are of extraordinary interest. The present review accounts for the recognized role of FXIII in the healing process and gives some examples on how to use it as prognostic biological/ molecular marker or as potential tailored therapeutic molecule in complex diseases.	267	275	CELL	cellular

Mithramycin demonstrates preclinical anticancer activity, but its therapeutic dose is limited by the development of hepatotoxicity that remains poorly characterized. A pharmacogenomics characterization of mithramycin-induced transaminitis revealed that hepatotoxicity is associated with germline variants in genes involved in bile disposition: <i>ABCB4</i> (multidrug resistance 3) rs2302387 and <i>ABCB11</i> [bile salt export pump (BSEP)] rs4668115 reduce transporter expression (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and were associated with ≥grade 3 transaminitis developing 24 hours after the third infusion of mithramycin (25 mcg/kg, 6 hours/infusion, every day ×7, every 28 days; <i>P</i> < 0.0040). A similar relationship was observed in a pediatric cohort. We therefore undertook to characterize the mechanism of mithramycin-induced acute transaminitis. As mithramycin affects cellular response to bile acid treatment by altering the expression of multiple bile transporters (e.g., ABCB4, ABCB11, sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, organic solute transporter <i>α</i>/<i>β</i>) in several cell lines [Huh7, HepaRG, HepaRG BSEP (-/-)] and primary human hepatocytes, we hypothesized that mithramycin inhibited bile-mediated activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR was downregulated in all hepatocyte cell lines and primary human hepatocytes (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and mithramycin inhibited chenodeoxycholic acid- and GW4046-induced FXR-galactose-induced gene 4 luciferase reporter activity (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Mithramycin promoted glycochenodeoxycholic acid-induced cytotoxicity in <i>ABCB11</i> (-<i>/</i>-) cells and increased the overall intracellular concentration of bile acids in primary human hepatocytes grown in sandwich culture (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Mithramycin is a FXR expression and FXR transactivation inhibitor that inhibits bile flow and potentiates bile-induced cellular toxicity, particularly in cells with low ABCB11 function. These results suggest that mithramycin causes hepatotoxicity through derangement of bile acid disposition; results also suggest that pharmacogenomic markers may be useful to identify patients who may tolerate higher mithramycin doses. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The present study characterizes a novel mechanism of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in which mithramycin not only alters farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner gene expression but also inhibits bile acid binding to FXR, resulting in deregulation of cellular bile homeostasis. Two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms in bile flow transporters are associated with mithramycin-induced liver function test elevations, and the present results are the rationale for a genotype-directed clinical trial using mithramycin in patients with thoracic malignancies.	865	873	CELL	cellular
Mithramycin demonstrates preclinical anticancer activity, but its therapeutic dose is limited by the development of hepatotoxicity that remains poorly characterized. A pharmacogenomics characterization of mithramycin-induced transaminitis revealed that hepatotoxicity is associated with germline variants in genes involved in bile disposition: <i>ABCB4</i> (multidrug resistance 3) rs2302387 and <i>ABCB11</i> [bile salt export pump (BSEP)] rs4668115 reduce transporter expression (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and were associated with ≥grade 3 transaminitis developing 24 hours after the third infusion of mithramycin (25 mcg/kg, 6 hours/infusion, every day ×7, every 28 days; <i>P</i> < 0.0040). A similar relationship was observed in a pediatric cohort. We therefore undertook to characterize the mechanism of mithramycin-induced acute transaminitis. As mithramycin affects cellular response to bile acid treatment by altering the expression of multiple bile transporters (e.g., ABCB4, ABCB11, sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, organic solute transporter <i>α</i>/<i>β</i>) in several cell lines [Huh7, HepaRG, HepaRG BSEP (-/-)] and primary human hepatocytes, we hypothesized that mithramycin inhibited bile-mediated activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR).

The peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are the key components of innate-immunity, and are highly specific for the recognition of bacterial peptidoglycans (PGN). Among different mammalian PGRPs, the PGRP1 binds to murein PGN of Gram-positive bacteria (lysine-type) and also have bactericidal activity towards Gram-negative bacteria (diaminopimelic acid or Dap-type). Buffaloes are the major sources of milk and meat in Asian sub-continents and are highly exposed to bacterial infections. The PGRP activates the innate-immune signaling, but their studies has been confined to limited species due to lack of structural and functional information. So, to understand the structural constituents, 3D model of buffalo PGRP1 (bfPGRP1) was constructed and conformational and dynamics properties of bfPGRP1 was studied. The bfPGRP1 model highly resembled human and camel PGRP structure, and shared a highly flexible N-terminus and centrally placed L-shaped cleft. Docking simulation of muramyl-tripeptide, tetrapeptide, pentapeptide-Dap-(MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap and MPP-Dap) and lysine-type (MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys) in AutoDock 4.2 and ArgusLab 4.0.1 anticipated β1, α2, α4, β4, and loops connecting β1-α2, α2-β2, β3-β4 and α4-α5 as the key interacting domains. The bfPGRP1-ligand complex molecular dynamics simulation followed by free binding energy (BE) computation conceded BE values of -18.30, -35.53, -41.80, -25.03, -24.62 and -22.30 kJ mol(-1) for MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap, MPP-Dap, MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys, respectively. The groove-surface and key binding residues involved in PGN-Dap and Lys-type interaction intended by the molecular docking, and were also accompanied by significant BE values directed their importance in pharmacogenomics, and warrants further in vivo studies for drug targeting and immune signaling pathways exploration.	1531	1545	CELL	groove-surface
We aimed to refine the value of CDX2 as an independent prognostic and predictive biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC) according to disease stage and chemotherapy sensitivity in preclinical models. CDX2 expression was evaluated in 1045 stage I-IV primary CRCs by gene expression (n = 403) or immunohistochemistry (n = 642) and in relation to 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and chemotherapy. Pharmacogenomic associations between CDX2 expression and 69 chemotherapeutics were assessed by drug screening of 35 CRC cell lines. CDX2 expression was lost in 11.6% of cases and showed independent poor prognostic value in multivariable models. For individual stages, CDX2 was prognostic only in stage IV, independent of chemotherapy. Among stage I-III patients not treated in an adjuvant setting, CDX2 loss was associated with a particularly poor survival in the BRAF-mutated subgroup, but prognostic value was independent of microsatellite instability status and the consensus molecular subtypes. In stage III, the 5-year RFS rate was higher among patients with loss of CDX2 who received adjuvant chemotherapy than among patients who did not. The CDX2-negative cell lines were significantly more sensitive to chemotherapeutics than CDX2-positive cells, and the multidrug resistance genes MDR1 and CFTR were significantly downregulated both in CDX2-negative cells and in patient tumors. Loss of CDX2 in CRC is an adverse prognostic biomarker only in stage IV disease and appears to be associated with benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III. Early-stage patients not qualifying for chemotherapy might be reconsidered for such treatment if their tumor has loss of CDX2 and mutated BRAF.	534	548	CELL	CRC cell lines

Differentiation blockade is a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A strategy to overcome such a blockade is a promising approach against the disease. The lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms hampers development of such strategies. Dysregulated ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is considered a druggable target in proliferative cancers susceptible to deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) depletion. Herein, we report an unanticipated discovery that hyperactivating RNR enables differentiation and decreases leukemia cell growth. We integrate pharmacogenomics and metabolomics analyses to identify that pharmacologically (eg, nelarabine) or genetically upregulating RNR subunit M2 (RRM2) creates a dNTP pool imbalance and overcomes differentiation arrest. Moreover, R-loop-mediated DNA replication stress signaling is responsible for RRM2 activation by nelarabine treatment. Further aggravating dNTP imbalance by depleting the dNTP hydrolase SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) enhances ablation of leukemia stem cells by RRM2 hyperactivation. Mechanistically, excessive activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling downstream of the imbalance contributes to cellular outcomes of RNR hyperactivation. A CRISPR screen identifies a synthetic lethal interaction between loss of DUSP6, an ERK-negative regulator, and nelarabine treatment. These data demonstrate that dNTP homeostasis governs leukemia maintenance, and a combination of DUSP inhibition and nelarabine represents a therapeutic strategy.	523	536	CELL	leukemia cell

Pharmacovigilance (PV) plays a key role in the healthcare system through assessment, monitoring and discovery of interactions amongst drugs and their effects in human. Pharmaceutical and biotechnological medicines are designed to cure, prevent or treat diseases; however, there are also risks particularly adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can cause serious harm to patients. Thus, for safety medication ADRs monitoring required for each medicine throughout its life cycle, during development of drug such as pre-marketing including early stages of drug design, clinical trials, and post-marketing surveillance. PV is concerns with the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of ADRs. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are an indispensable part of the clinical research. Variation in the human genome is a cause of variable response to drugs and susceptibility to diseases are determined, which is important for early drug discovery to PV. Moreover, PV has traditionally involved in mining spontaneous reports submitted to national surveillance systems. The research focus is shifting toward the use of data generated from platforms outside the conventional framework such as electronic medical records, biomedical literature, and patient-reported data in health forums. The emerging trend in PV is to link premarketing data with human safety information observed in the post-marketing phase. The PV system team obtains valuable additional information, building up the scientific data contained in the original report and making it more informative.

Pharmacovigilance (PV) plays a key role in the healthcare system through assessment, monitoring and discovery of interactions amongst drugs and their effects in human. Pharmaceutical and biotechnological medicines are designed to cure, prevent or treat diseases; however, there are also risks particularly adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can cause serious harm to patients. Thus, for safety medication ADRs monitoring required for each medicine throughout its life cycle, during development of drug such as pre-marketing including early stages of drug design, clinical trials, and post-marketing surveillance. PV is concerns with the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of ADRs. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are an indispensable part of the clinical research. Variation in the human genome is a cause of variable response to drugs and susceptibility to diseases are determined, which is important for early drug discovery to PV. Moreover, PV has traditionally involved in mining spontaneous reports submitted to national surveillance systems. The research focus is shifting toward the use of data generated from platforms outside the conventional framework such as electronic medical records, biomedical literature, and patient-reported data in health forums. The emerging trend in PV is to link premarketing data with human safety information observed in the post-marketing phase.

Drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) biotransform several toxins and xenobiotics in both tumor and normal cells, resulting in either their detoxification or their activation. Since DMEs also metabolize several chemotherapeutic drugs, they can significantly influence tumor response to chemotherapy and susceptibility of normal tissues to collateral toxicity of anticancer treatments.	102	107	CELL	cells
B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a hematological neoplasm of the stem lymphoid cell of the B lineage, characterized by the presence of genetic alterations closely related to the course of the disease. The number of alterations identified in these patients grows as studies of the disease progress, but in clinical practice, the conventional techniques frequently used are only capable of detecting the most common alterations. However, techniques, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), are being implemented to detect a wide spectrum of new alterations that also include point mutations.	74	92	CELL	stem lymphoid cell

<b>Aim:</b> Pharmacogenomics (PGx) tests are performed on whole-blood or saliva specimens. In patients with a transplanted liver, PGx results may be discordant with hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme activity. We evaluate the incidence and impact of PGx testing in liver transplant recipients, detail potential errors and describe clinical decision support (CDS) solution implemented. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A retrospective cohort study of liver transplant recipients at Mayo Clinic who underwent PGx testing between 1 January 1996 and 7 October 2019 were characterized. Impact of a CDS solution was evaluated. <b>Results:</b> There were 129 PGx tests in 117 patients. PGx testing incidence increased before (per year incidence rate ratio = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.20-1.74, p < 0.001) and after transplant (incidence rate ratio = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.27-1.72, p < 0.001). Three erroneous PGx tests were avoided 6 months following CDS implementation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Incidence of PGx testing in liver transplant recipients is increasing, leading to erroneous therapeutic decisions. CDS interventions and education are needed to prevent errors.	1	2	CELL	b

Personalized medicine is defined as individualized treatment based on the individual's genetic variants. Such treatment has the potential to enable pharmacogenetics, such as the prevention of 100,000 deaths per year in the USA because of adverse drug reactions or specify treatment in heart failure such at the beta 1 adrenergic receptor polymorphisms. It is claimed that coronary artery disease (CAD) is at least 50% because of genetic predisposition. Identification of the genes predisposing to CAD would greatly facilitate prevention, early treatment, and more specific therapies. The arrival of the multimillion single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array provides the high throughput genotyping required to perform genome-wide Association (GWA) studies. These studies require markers (SNPs) at intervals of 6,000 bp and sample size of several thousands. Platforms are available to genotype and process millions of genotypes per day. The GWA performed by the Ottawa Heart Genomic Study identified the first deoxyribonucleic acid region (9p21) predisposing to CAD after replication in six independent populations totaling 23,000. This was subsequently confirmed in several independent studies totally more than 45,000 individuals. The region confers a risk for CAD independent of known risk factors. 9p21 occurs in heterozygous form in 40 to 50% of Caucasians with increased risk of 15 to 20% and in homozygous form in 25% of Caucasians with increased risk of 40%. Identification of the genes predisposing to CAD is a prerequisite for personalized care of these patients. It is anticipated that most of the genes predisposing to CAD will be identified in the next 5 to 8 years. The 9p21, in addition to conferring increased risk, provides the bonus of being independent of known risk factors. Thus, 9p21 is likely to provide the impetus and nidus for a major research effort over the next few years. It has the potential to not only provide for early genetic screening but also as a target for novel therapy.	311	328	CELL	beta 1 adrenergic
Introduction: Alcohol dependence is one of the most important psychiatric disorders leading to enormous harm in individuals and indeed within society. Yet, although alcohol dependence is a disease of significant importance, the availability of efficacious pharmacological treatment is still limited. Areas covered: The current review focuses on neurobiological pathways that are the rationale for recent preclinical and clinical studies testing novel compounds that could be used as treatments for alcohol dependence. These neurobiological mechanisms include the: glutamatergic, dopaminergic and GABA mediated pathways as well as neuroendocrine systems. There is also an interest in the approaches for influencing chromatin structure. Expert opinion: There are several compounds in Phase I and Phase II clinical studies that have produced potentially useful results for the treating alcoholism. Further evaluation is still necessary, and the implementation of Phase III studies will help to elucidate the usefulness of these compounds. It is important that personalized approaches (e.g., pharmacogenomics) are investigated in these later studies, as the efficacy of different compounds may vary substantially between subgroups of patients.	630	644	CELL	neuroendocrine
Cancer drug screening in patient-derived cells holds great promise for personalized oncology and drug discovery but lacks standardization. Whether cells are cultured as conventional monolayer or advanced, matrix-dependent organoid cultures influences drug effects and thereby drug selection and clinical success. To precisely compare drug profiles in differently cultured primary cells, we developed <i>DeathPro</i>, an automated microscopy-based assay to resolve drug-induced cell death and proliferation inhibition. Using <i>DeathPro</i>, we screened cells from ovarian cancer patients in monolayer or organoid culture with clinically relevant drugs. Drug-induced growth arrest and efficacy of cytostatic drugs differed between the two culture systems. Interestingly, drug effects in organoids were more diverse and had lower therapeutic potential. Genomic analysis revealed novel links between drug sensitivity and DNA repair deficiency in organoids that were undetectable in monolayers. Thus, our results highlight the dependency of cytostatic drugs and pharmacogenomic associations on culture systems, and guide culture selection for drug tests.	25	46	CELL	patient-derived cells

In spite of the fact that the aging organism is the result of complex life-long gene/environment interactions, making peculiar the susceptibility to diseases and the response to drugs, pharmacogenetics studies are largely neglected in the aged. Altered response to drugs, cardiovascular and metabolic alterations, cancer and dementia are among the age associated ailments. The latter two are the major contributors to illness burden for the aged. Aging, dementia and cancer share a critical set of altered cellular functions in the response to DNA damage, genotoxic stress, and other insults. Aging in higher animals may be influenced by the balance of cell survival versus death, a decision often governed by checkpoint proteins in dividing cells. The paper is mainly focused on one of such proteins, p53 which has been recently shown to be involved in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Within this reference frame we studied p53 in aged controls and demented patients finding that with aging there is an increase of mutant like conformation state of p53 in peripheral blood cells, which is more pronounced in AD patients. As a result of such conformational change, p53 partially loses its activity and may become unable to properly activate an apoptotic program when cells are exposed to a noxious stimulus. Moreover we found that the tertiary structure of p53 and the sensitivity to p53-dependent apoptosis are affected by low concentrations of soluble beta amyloid, the peptide that accumulates in AD brain but also present in peripheral tissues. It is possible that p53 conformers may occur in the presence of misfolded molecules such as, but not limited to, beta amyloid. In particular at neuronal level the altered function of cell cycle proteins may affect synaptic plasticity rather than cell duplication.	506	514	CELL	cellular

In spite of the fact that the aging organism is the result of complex life-long gene/environment interactions, making peculiar the susceptibility to diseases and the response to drugs, pharmacogenetics studies are largely neglected in the aged. Altered response to drugs, cardiovascular and metabolic alterations, cancer and dementia are among the age associated ailments. The latter two are the major contributors to illness burden for the aged. Aging, dementia and cancer share a critical set of altered cellular functions in the response to DNA damage, genotoxic stress, and other insults. Aging in higher animals may be influenced by the balance of cell survival versus death, a decision often governed by checkpoint proteins in dividing cells. The paper is mainly focused on one of such proteins, p53 which has been recently shown to be involved in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Within this reference frame we studied p53 in aged controls and demented patients finding that with aging there is an increase of mutant like conformation state of p53 in peripheral blood cells, which is more pronounced in AD patients. As a result of such conformational change, p53 partially loses its activity and may become unable to properly activate an apoptotic program when cells are exposed to a noxious stimulus. Moreover we found that the tertiary structure of p53 and the sensitivity to p53-dependent apoptosis are affected by low concentrations of soluble beta amyloid, the peptide that accumulates in AD brain but also present in peripheral tissues. It is possible that p53 conformers may occur in the presence of misfolded molecules such as, but not limited to, beta amyloid. In particular at neuronal level the altered function of cell cycle proteins may affect synaptic plasticity rather than cell duplication.	1061	1083	CELL	peripheral blood cells

The present study aims at evaluating the association between seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five genes involved on antiretroviral pharmacokinetic pathways and virological failure in first line highly active antiretroviral therapy. Seven candidate polymorphisms (rs3842 and rs1045642 in ABCB1, rs212091 and rs3743527 in ABCC1, rs3745274 in CYP2B6, rs628031 in SLC22A1 and rs1517618 in SLCO3A1) were evaluated if they were associated with virological failure through logistic regression analysis. The study design was a retrospective cohort, analyzing 187 patients from Recife metropolitan region (Pernambuco, Brazil): among these 160 obtained complete suppression of HIV-1 replication (responders) and were compared to 27 non-responders, which underwent virological failure. There was no association between CYP2B6, SLC22A1, and SLCO3A1 SNPs and virological failure. Using logistic regression analysis, a significant association was detected between rs1045642 (3435C>T, ABCB1) and rs212091 (198217T>C; 3'-UTR, ABCC1) with virological failure of first-line antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors, when controlled by clinical factors, such as sex, age and race. The present results could contribute to unravel the influence of genetic background in anti-HIV-1 therapy outcome and help in treatment personalization of Northeast Brazil HIV infected patients.	205	209	CELL	line
Pancreatic cancer has the worst five-year survival rate of all malignancies due to its aggressive progression and resistance to therapy. Current therapies are limited to gemcitabine-based chemotherapeutics, surgery, and radiation. The current trend toward "personalized genomic medicine" has the potential to improve the treatment options for pancreatic cancer. Gene identification and genetic alterations like single nucleotide polymorphisms and mutations will allow physicians to predict the efficacy and toxicity of drugs, which could help diagnose pancreatic cancer, guide neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment, and evaluate patients' prognosis. This article reviews the multifaceted roles of genomics and pharmacogenomics in pancreatic cancer.	625	633	ORGANISM	patients
The latest consensus has changed <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping among Chinese population, while its impact on metoprolol tolerance and adverse events in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases remains unclear. In this study, we prospectively included elderly patients who started metoprolol treatment for cardiovascular indications. According to the latest consensus on <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype-to-phenotype translation, the patients were categorized as normal, intermediate, or poor metabolizers (NMs, IMs, or PMs, respectively) by detecting the presence of the <i>CYP2D6*1</i>, <i>*2</i>, <i>*5</i>, <i>*10</i>, and <i>*14</i>. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between the <i>CYP2D6</i> phenotype and incidence of adverse events, which were assessed over a 12-week period. In this study, there were 651 (62.7%) NMs, 385 (37.1%) IMs, and 3 (0.3%) PMs. After 12 weeks of follow-up, compared with NMs, IMs had the lower maintenance dose [50.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day vs. 25.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day, <i>p</i> < 0.001] and lower weight-adjusted maintenance doses (0.52 ± 0.25 mg/day/kg vs. 0.42 ± 0.22 mg/day/kg, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and had higher incidence of postural hypotension (6.0% vs. 10.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.006), bradycardia (21.5% vs. 28.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.011), asystole (0.8% vs. 3.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and syncope (2.0% vs. 6.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.001). In logistic regression model, the overall incidence of adverse events was 1.37-fold larger in IMs than in NMs (odds ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.79, <i>p</i> = 0.021). We conclude that IMs have lower tolerance and higher incidence of metoprolol-related adverse events than NMs in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases. <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping is justifiable in elderly patients to minimize the risk of adverse events and ensure the benefits of metoprolol.	163	171	ORGANISM	patients

Combination drug therapies have become an integral part of precision oncology, and while evidence of clinical effectiveness continues to grow, the underlying mechanisms supporting synergy are poorly understood. Immortalized human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) have been proven as a particularly useful, scalable and low-cost model in pharmacogenetics research, and are suitable for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of synergistic combination therapies. In this review, we cover the advantages of LCLs in synergy pharmacogenomics and consider recent studies providing initial evidence of the utility of LCLs in synergy research. We also discuss several opportunities for LCL-based systems to address gaps in the research through the expansion of testing regimens, assessment of new drug classes and higher-order combinations, and utilization of integrated omics technologies.	224	255	ORGANISM	human lymphoblastoid cell lines
Warfarin is a cornerstone of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Anticoagulation with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation is over twice as effective in secondary prevention of stroke as any other tested alternatives, including all other antithrombotic drugs or surgical interventions. General belief is that warfarin is capable of preventing 20 ischemic strokes for every hemorrhagic one it causes. However, warfarin is one of the most feared agents as a result of its woeful safety profile and difficulties in maintaining the proper daily dose. Recent research in pharmacogenetics predominantly focused on elucidating the influence of individual genetic predispositions to administered warfarin. Although the incorporation of genotype information improves the accuracy of adequate dose prediction, an improvement in anticoagulation control or a reduction in hemorrhagic complications has not been yet convincingly demonstrated. It is clear that identifying an individual patient's risk for hemorrhage on warfarin will require more broad clinical and genetic studies. Future research focused on patients with stroke should concentrate on defining the possible differences, especially focusing on predicting bleeding events in general and intracranial hemorrhages in particular. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing evidence about pharmacogenetics of warfarin in general, especially focusing on stroke prevention.	106	114	ORGANISM	patients

Obesity is a global epidemic that is a leading cause of preventable death. In addition to lifestyle modification, there are numerous obesity treatments for clinicians to consider, including medications. Lorcaserin immediate release/extended release (IR/XR) is a US Food and Drug Administration approved medication for overweight and obese patients to be used with lifestyle modifications. Lorcaserin is thought to reduce weight by targeting the serotonin (5HT<sub>2c</sub>) system to induce satiety. Lorcaserin IR has been shown to be effective in reducing weight in overweight (body mass index [BMI] > 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obese (BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participants in three large Phase III trials. In addition, lorcaserin has been shown to reduce post-cessation weight gain and improved smoking cessation in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. A recent meta-analysis suggested in overweight diabetic patients lorcaserin may be added to first-line oral hypoglycemic medications to enhance reduction in glycated hemoglobin. Lorcaserin is generally well tolerated with the most common side effect being headache, which is typically self-limiting. Lorcaserin XR (once daily) was recently approved and has been shown to be bioequivalent to lorcaserin IR (twice daily) in a pivotal study. Lorcaserin XRs, main advantage over the IR formulation is the once daily dosing regimen, which likely would lead to improved adherence and thus improved clinical effectiveness. The present review will evaluate the lorcaserin clinical studies (obesity, diabetes, and addiction), XR bioequivalence studies, pharmacogenomics of the serotonin (5HT<sub>2c</sub>) system, and adherence data in once daily versus twice daily medications.	339	347	ORGANISM	patients

The present review will evaluate the lorcaserin clinical studies (obesity, diabetes, and addiction), XR bioequivalence studies, pharmacogenomics of the serotonin (5HT<sub>2c</sub>) system, and adherence data in once daily versus twice daily medications.	1296	1310	ORGANISM	Lorcaserin XRs
There is considerable inter-individual variability in the effectiveness and safety of pharmaceutical interventions. This phenomenon can be attributed to a multitude of factors; however, it is widely acknowledged that common genetic variation affecting drug absorption or metabolism play a substantial contributory role. This is a concept known as pharmacogenetics. Understanding how common genetic variants influence responses to medications, and using this knowledge to inform prescribing practice, could yield significant advantages for both patients and healthcare systems. Some health services around the world have introduced pharmacogenetics into routine practice, whereas others are less advanced along the implementation pathway. This chapter introduces the field of pharmacogenetics, the existing body of evidence, and discusses barriers to implementation. The chapter will specifically focus on efforts to introduce pharmacogenetics in the NHS, highlighting key challenges related to scale, informatics, and education.	544	552	ORGANISM	patients

The dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase gene (DPYD)*9A (c.85T>C) genotype is relatively common. The correlation between DPYD*9A genotype and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency phenotype is controversial. In a cohort of 28 patients, DPYD*9A was the most commonly diagnosed variant (13 patients [46%]) and there was a noticeable genotype-phenotype correlation. In this study we genotyped a larger cohort of a mixed racial background to explore the prevalence of DPYD*9A variant and to confirm the genotype-phenotype correlation.	232	240	ORGANISM	patients

Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine interventions hold promise to optimize drug treatment modalities and hence, improve the quality of life of the patients by minimizing the occurrence of adverse drug reactions and/or maximizing drug treatment efficacy. To this end, proper guidance for accurately prescribing the correct drug at the right dose is empowered by major regulatory bodies, namely the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA), and well-recognized research consortia, like the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), that propose therapeutic recommendations after the thorough evaluation of the existing scientific evidence base. In this context, the consistency of these recommendations is crucial for smoothly integrating pharmacogenomics into the clinic. Here, we collected all of the important and clinically actionable pharmacogenomics information provided by the aforementioned renowned sources and documented it in order to assess potential similarities and, most importantly, differences. Our data show that the level of concordance regarding the guidance provided for the same drug-gene association pairs varies significantly, despite the fact that it all derives from a single evidence base. In particular, apart from the expected similarities in a number of association pairs, especially the ones related to cancer genomics, there are still major discrepancies that create confusion as to which guidance should be followed in order to properly inform drug prescribing. This regulatory deficiency calls for the fruitful engagement of the regulatory agencies involved with the contribution of other experts engaged in the field of pharmacogenomics in an effort to harmonize the existing arsenal of guidance for genome-informed drug prescription. The achievement of harmonization would in turn expedite bringing personalized medicine closer to clinical fruition.	154	162	ORGANISM	patients
Oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy has been the main treatment approach for stroke prevention for decades. Warfarin is the most widely prescribed OAC in the United States, but is difficult to manage due to variability in dose requirements across individuals. Pharmacogenomics may mitigate risk concerns related to warfarin use by fostering the opportunity to facilitate individualized medicine approaches to warfarin treatment (e.g., genome-guided dosing). While various economic evaluations exist examining the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics testing for warfarin, few observational studies exist to support these studies, with even fewer using genotype as the main exposure of interest. We examined a cohort of individuals initiating warfarin therapy between 2004 and 2017 and examined bleeding and cost outcomes for the year following initiation using Mayo Clinic's billing and administrative data, as well the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cost Data Warehouse. Analyses included descriptive summaries, comparison of characteristics across exposure groups, reporting of crude outcomes, and multivariate analyses. We included N = 1,143 patients for analyses. Just over a third of our study population (34.9%) carried a warfarin-sensitive phenotype. Sensitive individuals differed in their baseline characteristics by being of older age and having a higher number of comorbid conditions; myocardial infarction, diabetes, and cancer in particular. The occurrence of bleeding events was not significantly different across exposure groups. No significant differences across exposure groups existed in either the likelihood of incurring all-cause healthcare costs or in the magnitude of those costs. Warfarin-sensitive individuals were no more likely to utilize cardiovascular-related healthcare services; however, they had lower total and inpatient cardiovascular-related costs compared to warfarin-insensitive patients. No significant differences existed in any other categories of costs. We found limited evidence that warfarin-sensitive individuals have different healthcare spending than warfarin-insensitive individuals. Additional real-world studies are needed to support the traditional economic evaluations currently existing in the literature.	1135	1143	ORGANISM	patients

Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors tonically inhibit colonic motility and the alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, given intravenously, increased colonic tone in humans. However, the effect of yohimbine on colonic transit in humans is unknown. In this study, 30 healthy volunteers were randomized to yohimbine 16.2 mg p.o. t.i.d. or identical placebo for 7 days. We evaluated gastric emptying, small intestinal, and colonic transit by scinitigraphy, bowel habits, haemodynamics and plasma catecholamines. As cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize yohimbine, P450 genotypes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) were determined in 25 of 30 subjects who consented to genetic studies. The relationship between drug metabolizer status predicted by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and effects of yohmibine were assessed. Compared to placebo, yohimbine increased (P < or = 0.02) diastolic blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline concentrations and maximum tolerated volume during the satiation test [yohimbine (1241 +/- 88, mean +/- SEM) vs placebo (1015 +/- 87), P = 0.054]. However, yohimbine did not affect gastrointestinal transit. Based on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 alleles, seven and 18 subjects were, respectively, extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of yohimbine. Compared to EM, PM of yohimbine had a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline (P = 0.1 for PM vs EM), lower maximum tolerated volumes (1120 +/- 95 vs 1484 + 131 mL, P = 0.02), and faster colonic transit (i.e. GC(24) was 3.0 +/- 0.4 vs 2.1 +/- 0.5, P = 0.1). These data suggest that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genotypes which determine the metabolism of yohimbine may influence its sympathetic and gastrointestinal effects.	161	167	ORGANISM	humans

Phenazepam is commonly administered to patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Some proportion of such patients do not show adequate response to treatment regimen containing phenazepam, whereas many of them experience type A adverse drug reactions. Previous studies showed that CYP2D6 IS involved in the biotransformation of phenazepam, the activity of which is highly dependent on the polymorphism of the gene encoding it. Objective. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of 1846G>A polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene on the concentration/dose indicator of phenazepam, using findings on enzymatic activity of CYP2D6 (as evaluated by the 6M-THBC/pinoline ratio measurement) and on CYP2D6 expression level obtained by measuring the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma concentration levels in patients suffering from major depressive disorder.	39	47	ORGANISM	patients

Esophageal cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies. Surgical resection of the tumor from the primary site has been the standard treatment, especially for localized squamous cell carcinoma, but considerable clinical efforts during the last decade have resulted in novel courses of treatment. These options include chemoradiotherapy, consisting of a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin (CDDP), and concurrent radiation. Given the substantial inter- and/or intra-individual variation in clinical outcome, future improvements will likely require the incorporation of a novel anticancer drug, pharmacokinetically guided administration of CDDP or 5-FU, and identification of potential responders by patient genetic profiling prior to treatment. In this review, the latest information on incidence, risk factors, biomarkers, therapeutic strategies, and the pharmacokinetically guided or genotype-guided administration of CDDP and 5-FU is summarized for future individualization of esophageal cancer treatment.	719	726	ORGANISM	patient
The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril is hydrolysed to an active metabolite, enalaprilat, in the liver via carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). Previous studies show that variant rs71647871 in the CES1 gene affects the pharmacokinetics of enalapril on liver samples as well as healthy volunteers. This study included 286 Caucasian patients with arterial hypertension who received enalapril. The concentrations of enalapril and enalaprilat were determined before subsequent intake of the drug and 4 h after it with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometric detection. The study included genetic markers as follows: rs2244613, rs71647871 (c.428G>A, p.G143E) and three SNPs indicating the presence of a subtype CES1A1c (rs12149368, rs111604615 and rs201577108). Mean peak and trough enalaprilat concentrations, adjusted by clinical variables, were significantly lower in CES1 rs2244613 heterozygotes (by 16.6% and 19.6%) and in CC homozygotes (by 32.7% and 41.4%) vs. the AA genotype. In CES1A1c homozygotes, adjusted mean enalaprilat concentrations were 75% lower vs. heterozygotes and wild-type (WT) homozygotes. Pharmacogenetic markers of the CES1 gene may be a promising predictor for individualisation when prescribing enalapril.	337	345	ORGANISM	patients
Pharmacogenomics is about selecting the "right drug in the right amount for the right patient." In metastatic colorectal cancer, germline pharmacogenomics testing presents a unique opportunity to improve outcomes, since the genes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase metabolizing the chemotherapy drugs, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan are already well known. In a retrospective analysis of the landmark TRIBE clinical trial [(TRIBE - TRIplet plus BEvacizumab multicenter, phase III trial by the Italian Cooperative GONO (Gruppo Oncologico Nord Ovest) group (NCT00719797)], the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was higher in those with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase/UDP-glucuronosyltransferase aberrations and was dose dependent. We aimed to report on the feasibility and the results of incorporating pharmacogenomics testing into clinical practice.	86	93	ORGANISM	patient

Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is the most common treatment for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (m-CRC). Therapy with 5-FU/folinic acid (FA) continues to be a standard treatment in developing countries. Pharmacogenomics allows the tailoring of cancer therapy to the patient. The polymorphism 677C>T of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene seems to influence the effectiveness of treatment with 5-FU. We undertook this study to evaluate the frequency of MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism and its relationship to the time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in m-CRC treated with 5-FU/FA.	281	288	ORGANISM	patient
The pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus can be partly explained by CYP3A5 activity. Our objective was to evaluate a tacrolimus sparing policy on renal graft outcome according to <i>CYP3A5</i> 6986A>G genetic polymorphism. This retrospective study included 1114 recipients with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Genotyping of the 6986A>G allelic variant corresponding to <i>CYP3A5*3</i> was systematically performed. One year after transplantation, tacrolimus blood trough concentration (C0) target range was 5-7 ng/mL. However, daily dose was capped to 0.10 mg/kg/day regardless of the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype. A total 208 <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients were included. Despite a higher daily dose, <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients exhibited lower C0 during follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of <i>CYP3A5*1</i>/- genotype (HR = 0.70, 0.46-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.10) on patient-graft survival. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline was significantly lower for the <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> genotype did not significantly impact the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (HR = 1.01, 0.68-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.97) despite significantly lower C0. Based on our experience, a strategy of tacrolimus capping is associated with a better GFR evolution in <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients without any significant increase of BPAR incidence. Our study raised some issues about specific therapeutic tacrolimus C0 targets for <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients and suggests to set up randomized control studies in this specific population.	267	277	ORGANISM	recipients

Over 10 million SNPs have been discovered to date as the result of both a private and public effort in the past two decades. Extensive investigations on SNPs have been performed to assess clinical applications for pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine. Recently, around the 10(th) anniversary of the first publication by the Human Genome Project, Hamburg and Collins addressed questions regarding the progress of the genomics field and its impact on pharmacogenomics / Personalized Medicine. Similar questions remain around the potential link of SNPs to Personalized Medicine applications, and the extent to which they have impacted "real world" clinical practices. Built upon these previous efforts, and to achieve our objectives of describing and assessing the role of SNPs and their impact on Personalized Medicine, this article analyzes and summarizes the clinical relevance, molecular mechanisms, clinical evidence, and preliminary regulatory and clinical guideline information of relevant SNPs. In addition, it focuses on two applications directly related to Personalized Medicine drug therapeutics: predictive biomarkers for patient stratification and dose selection. In summary, this article attempts to provide a general and comprehensive view of the role of SNPs in pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine, as well as a practical view of their impact on clinical practice today.	330	335	ORGANISM	Human

Allogenic solid organ transplantation has become the routine procedure in patients with end stage organ disease. Although the transplanted organ compensates deficient body functions, its allogenic nature requires institution of immune tolerance, nowadays provided by immunosuppressive drug administration. Both the safety and efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment depend on many factors, and maintaining levels of immunosuppressants within therapeutic range is the essential target for success in graft function preservation. It is obvious that drug and metabolite concentrations depend on efficiency of individual patient metabolism. Recently, many studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between genetic factors, drug pharmacokinetics and therapy outcome, and interindividual variability apparently can be explained, at least in part, by genetically determined polymorphisms of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, transport proteins and also in some cases, drug targets. This review presents the recent state of knowledge in the field of pharmacogenetics related to solid organ transplantation.	74	82	ORGANISM	patients

Recently, many studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between genetic factors, drug pharmacokinetics and therapy outcome, and interindividual variability apparently can be explained, at least in part, by genetically determined polymorphisms of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, transport proteins and also in some cases, drug targets. This review presents the recent state of knowledge in the field of pharmacogenetics related to solid organ transplantation.	617	624	ORGANISM	patient
Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.	386	391	ORGANISM	mouse

Coronary artery disease (CAD) has a high mortality rate. Despite various therapeutic targets, non-responsiveness to drugs remains a prevalent issue. Pharmacogenomics assesses the way an individual's genetic attributes affect their likely response to drug therapy. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms play a crucial role in determining these outcomes. This review offers an overview of single-nucleotide polymorphisms investigated in clinical studies and their associations with drug response/nonresponse in the treatment of CAD. A total of 104 studies of whole sets of chromosomes and several genes were explored. A total of 161 polymorphisms exhibited associations with drug response/nonresponse in CAD across diverse ethnic populations. This pool can serve as a pharmacogenomic biomarker for predicting response to drug therapy in patients with CAD.	829	837	ORGANISM	patients
Precision medicine has the potential to transform healthcare by moving from one-size-fits-all to personalised treatment and care. This transition has been greatly facilitated through new high-throughput sequencing technologies that can provide the unique molecular profile of each individual patient, along with the rapid development of targeted therapies directed to the Achilles heels of each disease. To implement precision medicine approaches in healthcare, many countries have adopted national strategies and initiated genomic/precision medicine initiatives to provide equal access to all citizens. In other countries, such as Sweden, this has proven more difficult due to regionally organised healthcare. Using a bottom-up approach, key stakeholders from academia, healthcare, industry and patient organisations joined forces and formed Genomic Medicine Sweden (GMS), a national infrastructure for the implementation of precision medicine across the country. To achieve this, Genomic Medicine Centres have been established to provide regionally distributed genomic services, and a national informatics infrastructure has been built to allow secure data handling and sharing. GMS has a broad scope focusing on rare diseases, cancer, pharmacogenomics, infectious diseases and complex diseases, while also providing expertise in informatics, ethical and legal issues, health economy, industry collaboration and education. In this review, we summarise our experience in building a national infrastructure for precision medicine. We also provide key examples how precision medicine already has been successfully implemented within our focus areas. Finally, we bring up challenges and opportunities associated with precision medicine implementation, the importance of international collaboration, as well as the future perspective in the field of precision medicine.	292	299	ORGANISM	patient

The optimal dose of warfarin depends on polymorphisms in the VKORC1 (the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit (1) and CYP2C9 (cytochrome P450 2C9) genes. To minimize the risk of adverse reactions, warfarin dosages should be adjusted according to results from rapid and simple monitoring methods. However, there are few pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithms that are based on large cohorts from the Chinese population, especially patients with atrial fibrillation. This study aimed to validate a pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithm based on results from a new rapid electrochemical detection method used in a multicenter study. Three SNPs (CYP2C9 *2, *3 and VKORC1 c.-1639G > A) were genotyped by electrochemical detection using a sandwich-type format that included a 3' short thiol capture probe and a 5' ferrocene-labeled signal probe. A total of 1285 samples from four clinical hospitals were evaluated. Concordance rates between the results from the electrochemical DNA biosensor and the sequencing test were 99.8%. The results for gene distribution showed that most Chinese patients had higher warfarin susceptibility because mutant-type and heterozygotes were present in the majority of subjects (99.4%) at locus c.-1639G > A. When the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium algorithm was used to estimate therapeutic dosages for 362 patients with AF and the values were compared with their actual dosages, the results revealed that 56.9% were similar to actual dosages (within the 20% range). A novel electrochemical detection method of CYP2C9 *2, *3and VKORC1 c.-1639G > A alleles was evaluated. The warfarin dosing algorithm based on data gathered from a large patient cohort can facilitate the reasonable and effective use of warfarin in Chinese patients with AF.	448	456	ORGANISM	patients

Genetic factors associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) have been widely studied over the last decade. We examined whether genetic variants previously associated with BMI in the general population are associated with cardiometabolic parameter worsening in the psychiatric population receiving psychotropic drugs, a high-risk group for metabolic disturbances. Classification And Regression Trees (CARTs) were used as a tool capable of describing hierarchical associations, to pinpoint genetic variants best predicting worsening of cardiometabolic parameters (i.e total, HDL and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and blood pressure) following prescription of psychotropic drugs inducing weight gain in a discovery sample of 357 Caucasian patients. Significant findings were tested for replication in a second Caucasian psychiatric sample (n=140). SH2B1 rs3888190C>A was significantly associated with LDL levels in the discovery and in the replication sample, with A-allele carriers having 0.2mmol/l (p=0.005) and 0.36mmol/l (p=0.007) higher LDL levels compared to others, respectively. G-allele carriers of RABEP1 rs1000940A>G had lower fasting glucose levels compared to others in both samples (-0.16mmol/l; p<0.001 and -0.77mmol/l; p=0.03 respectively). The present study is the first to observe such associations in human subjects, which may in part be explained by a high risk towards dyslipidemia and diabetes in psychiatric patients receiving psychotropic treatments compared to population-based individuals. These results may therefore give new insight into the etiology of LDL-cholesterol and glucose regulation in psychiatric patients under psychotropic drug therapy.	787	795	ORGANISM	patients

The threats involved in the long-term opioid treatment of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) have increased notably. Strategies to identify at-risk patients are important because there is no clear evidence showing which screening or deprescription programmes are appropriate. Our aim was to evaluate the evidence provided by pharmacogenetics applied to predict an analgesic toxicity profile in prescription opioid use disorder (POUD) patients participating in an opioid deprescription programme. Pharmacogenetic markers were analysed in an observational, prospective deprescription programme for POUD patients (n = 88) treated for CNCP. It consisted of monitoring visits (baseline, follow-up and final), opioid rotation or discontinuation and the recording of adverse events and suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Variants in OPRM1 (A118G), ABCB1 (C3435T), COMT (G472A), OPRD1 (T921C) and ARRB2 (C8622T) genes were tested by real-time PCR. Ethics committee approved the study. Wild-type OPRM1-AA genotype carriers reported a significantly higher number of adverse events than OPRM1-AG/GG (median [p25-75], 7 [5-11] vs 5 [3-9]), particularly gastrointestinal system events (90% vs 63%) such as nausea (33% vs 0%). Suspected ADRs (affecting 17% of the patients) were three times higher in males than in females (30% vs 11%). The deprescription programme was effective and safe, and it achieved a significant progressive reduction in the morphine equivalent daily dose, strong opioids and other analgesics' use, without causing any changes in pain intensity or opiate abstinence syndrome. OPRM1 gene polymorphisms could identify the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in POUD patients. Deprescription programmes including pharmacogenetic analysis should be considered during the follow-up of this population.	144	152	ORGANISM	patients

Our aim was to evaluate the evidence provided by pharmacogenetics applied to predict an analgesic toxicity profile in prescription opioid use disorder (POUD) patients participating in an opioid deprescription programme. Pharmacogenetic markers were analysed in an observational, prospective deprescription programme for POUD patients (n = 88) treated for CNCP. It consisted of monitoring visits (baseline, follow-up and final), opioid rotation or discontinuation and the recording of adverse events and suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Variants in OPRM1 (A118G), ABCB1 (C3435T), COMT (G472A), OPRD1 (T921C) and ARRB2 (C8622T) genes were tested by real-time PCR. Ethics committee approved the study. Wild-type OPRM1-AA genotype carriers reported a significantly higher number of adverse events than OPRM1-AG/GG (median [p25-75], 7 [5-11] vs 5 [3-9]), particularly gastrointestinal system events (90% vs 63%) such as nausea (33% vs 0%). Suspected ADRs (affecting 17% of the patients) were three times higher in males than in females (30% vs 11%). The deprescription programme was effective and safe, and it achieved a significant progressive reduction in the morphine equivalent daily dose, strong opioids and other analgesics' use, without causing any changes in pain intensity or opiate abstinence syndrome. OPRM1 gene polymorphisms could identify the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in POUD patients. Deprescription programmes including pharmacogenetic analysis should be considered during the follow-up of this population.	1252	1260	ORGANISM	patients

Recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the only drug used during the acute phase of stroke. Despite its important benefits, a percentage of patients suffer symptomatic hemorrhagic transformations or a lack of early recanalization rates. These undesirable effects are associated with acute neurological and long-term functional deterioration. For the past 20 years, pharmacogenetic studies have tried to find the genetic risk factors associated with rtPA response. Most of these studies have used a gene-candidate strategy; however, recent genome-wide association studies have emerged indicating that genetic predisposition could modulate rtPA response. This review summarizes the most interesting findings in this field, including which genes and genetic variations are associated with hemorrhagic transformations and recanalization rates after thrombolytic therapy.	152	160	ORGANISM	patients
In recent years, the term "personalized medicine" has been increasingly mentioned in relation to the endeavours to tailor the pharmaceutical as well as regimen therapy to the needs and requirements of individual patients. The personalization of antidiabetic treatment has undergone a dramatic advancement in relation to the expansion of knowledge about diabetes. From the empirical it moved forward to the phenotypic level which made it possible to differentiate between individual types of diabetes. The pathogenetic personalization which began to be used within Type 2 diabetes in the 1960s, was based on the assumption that while insulin resistance predominates in some patients, others are mainly affected by insulin secretion deficit. Biostatistics-personalized medicine (evidence based medicine) gathered evidence based on which metformin was included in recommendations on the therapy for Type 2 diabetes as a first-line drug. Although randomized studies during the first decade of the 21st century did not prove superiority of any other treatment modality as an adjunctive therapy used with metformin, they brought with them individualization of the goals of glycemic con-trol. At present, personalization is heading towards the pharmacogenetic level that will enable in the near future individualized therapy in terms of choice of first-, second- and third-line drugs depending on the panel of key gene polymorphisms which characterize sensitivity of an individual to specific antidiabetics. Finally, the "tailor-maded therapy" should be chosen based on a synthesis of pathogenetic, biostatistic and pharmacogenetic knowledge that will reflect the translation of results of the basic biomedical research into the clinical practice.Key words: evidence based medicine - pathogenesis - personalized therapy - pharmacogenetics - type 2 diabetes.	212	220	ORGANISM	patients

Variation in gene expression has been found to be important in disease susceptibility and pharmacogenomics. Local and distant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been identified via genome-wide association study (GWAS); yet the functional analysis of these variants has been challenging. The aim of this study was to unravel the functional consequence of a gene with a local SNP with evidence for local and distant regulatory roles in cellular sensitivity to cisplatin, one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs. To this end, we measured cellular susceptibility to cisplatin in 176 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from Yoruba individuals from Ibadan, Nigeria. The 276 cytotoxicity-associated SNPs at the suggestive threshold of P ≤ 0.0001 were significantly enriched for eQTLs. Of these SNPs, we found one intronic SNP, rs17115814, that had a significant relationship with the expression level of its host gene, PRPF39 (P= 0.0007), and a significant correlation with the expression of over 100 distant transcripts (P ≤ 0.0001). Successful knockdown of PRPF39 expression using siRNA resulted in a significant increase in cisplatin resistance. We then measured the expression of 61 downstream targets after PRPF39 knockdown and found 53 gene targets had significant (P ≤ 0.05) expression changes. Included in the list of genes that significantly changed after PRPF39 knockdown were MAP3K4 and TFPD2, two important signaling genes previously shown to be relevant in cisplatin response. Thus, modulation of a local target gene identified through a GWAS was followed by a downstream cascade of gene expression changes resulting in greater resistance to cisplatin.	673	679	ORGANISM	Ibadan
Gender dysphoria is the imparity between a person's experienced gender and their birth-assigned gender. Gender transition is the process of adapting a person's sexual characteristics to match their experienced gender. The number of adults receiving sex hormone therapy for gender dysphoria is increasingly and these pharmacotherapies are increasing being prescribed in a general practice setting. The role of hormone therapy is to reverse or reduce physical sexual characteristics of the birth-assigned gender and enhance and build characteristics aligning to the expressed gender and these therapies apply to both transgender and gender nonconforming patients. Recognizing the options and interpreting the effects of gender transition therapies are fundamental to the discussion and treatment of gender dysphoria. This review summarizes pharmacodynamics, comparative dosing, adverse effects, monitoring, and potential pharmacogenetic influence of current pharmacotherapy. These include the use of 17-beta-estradiol, spironolactone, testosterone, GnRH agonists as well as adjunctive phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. The article also addresses gaps within the published literature including optimal routes of administration for individual patients, risks of malignancy and dosing reductions as transgender patients age.	652	660	ORGANISM	patients

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key membrane-embedded receptor proteins, with critical roles in cellular signal transduction. In the era of precision medicine, understanding the role of natural variants on GPCR function is critical, especially from a pharmacogenomics viewpoint. Studies involved in mapping variants to GPCR structures are briefly reviewed here. The endocannabinoid system involving the central nervous system (CNS), the human cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), is an important drug target and its variability has implications for disease susceptibility and altered drug and pain response. We have carried out a computational study to map deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) to CB1. CB1 mutations were computationally evaluated from neutral to deleterious, and the top twelve deleterious mutations, with structural information, were found to be either close to the ligand binding region or the G-protein binding site. We have mapped these to the active and inactive CB1 X-ray crystallographic structures to correlate variants with available phenotypic information. We have also carried out molecular dynamics simulations to functionally characterize four selected mutants.	445	473	ORGANISM	human cannabinoid receptor 1

Optimizing antipsychotic pharmacotherapy is often challenging due to significant variability in effectiveness and tolerability. Genetic factors influencing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may contribute to some of this variability. Research studies have characterized these pharmacogenetic relationships, and some genetic markers are now available as clinical tests. These advances in pharmacogenetics research and test availability have great potential to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in psychiatric patients. For clinicians considering using pharmacogenetics, it is important to understand the clinical implications and also the limitations of markers included in currently available tests. This review focuses on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic gene variants that are currently available in commercial genetic testing panels. Associations of these variants with clinical efficacy and adverse effects, as well as other clinical implications, in antipsychotic pharmacotherapy are discussed.	524	532	ORGANISM	patients
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and heterogeneous disorder characterized by remitting and relapsing periods of activity. Pharmacogenetics refers to the study of the effect of inheritance on individual variation in drug responses. Several drug-related markers in IBD patients have been identified in order to predict the response to medical treatment including biological therapy as well as the reduction of adverse events. In the future, the treatment of IBD should be personalized in its specific profile to provide the most efficacious treatment with lack of adverse events.	280	288	ORGANISM	patients

Mental health problems are the leading cause of disability in Canadian workers. Medication ineffectiveness is hypothesized to increase the time to return-to-work in these workers. We assessed whether prescription changes based on pharmacogenomics profiling ( Report<sup>®</sup>) improved medication effectiveness in patients on mental health-related disability. In this retrospective cohort analyses, we assessed the impact of pharmacogenomic profiling on patient outcomes in 84 Canadian workers who were on a mental health-related disability between May 2018 and May 2019. All patients completed an informed consent form and a standard questionnaire including medical history, medications, disease symptoms, and medication side effects. Licensed pharmacists made recommendations for prescription changes in 83 patients. The main study outcome was medication effectiveness defined on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 being most effective and 10 being most ineffective) based on reported mood toward regular work tasks and medication side effects. We compared the medication effectiveness at baseline and at 3 months after the pharmacogenomics-based prescription changes. This retrospective cohort analyses included 46 patients who completed the follow-up questionnaires. Of them, 54% (<i>n</i> = 25) were females, 67% (n = 31) were Caucasians, and the mean age was 38 years (standard deviation [SD] = 11). The average baseline effectiveness score was 8.39 (SD =1.22). Following the prescription changes, the medication effectiveness scores significantly improved to an average of 2.30 (SD = 1.01) at 3 months of follow-up (effect size <i>r</i> = 0.62, <i>p</i> = <0.001).

Pancreatic cancer has the worst five-year survival rate of all malignancies due to its aggressive progression and resistance to therapy. Current therapies are limited to gemcitabine-based chemotherapeutics, surgery, and radiation. The current trend toward "personalized genomic medicine" has the potential to improve the treatment options for pancreatic cancer. Gene identification and genetic alterations like single nucleotide polymorphisms and mutations will allow physicians to predict the efficacy and toxicity of drugs, which could help diagnose pancreatic cancer, guide neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment, and evaluate patients' prognosis. This article reviews the multifaceted roles of genomics and pharmacogenomics in pancreatic cancer.	726	743	CANCER	pancreatic cancer
The latest consensus has changed <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping among Chinese population, while its impact on metoprolol tolerance and adverse events in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases remains unclear. In this study, we prospectively included elderly patients who started metoprolol treatment for cardiovascular indications. According to the latest consensus on <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype-to-phenotype translation, the patients were categorized as normal, intermediate, or poor metabolizers (NMs, IMs, or PMs, respectively) by detecting the presence of the <i>CYP2D6*1</i>, <i>*2</i>, <i>*5</i>, <i>*10</i>, and <i>*14</i>. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between the <i>CYP2D6</i> phenotype and incidence of adverse events, which were assessed over a 12-week period. In this study, there were 651 (62.7%) NMs, 385 (37.1%) IMs, and 3 (0.3%) PMs. After 12 weeks of follow-up, compared with NMs, IMs had the lower maintenance dose [50.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day vs. 25.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day, <i>p</i> < 0.001] and lower weight-adjusted maintenance doses (0.52 ± 0.25 mg/day/kg vs. 0.42 ± 0.22 mg/day/kg, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and had higher incidence of postural hypotension (6.0% vs. 10.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.006), bradycardia (21.5% vs. 28.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.011), asystole (0.8% vs. 3.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and syncope (2.0% vs. 6.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.001). In logistic regression model, the overall incidence of adverse events was 1.37-fold larger in IMs than in NMs (odds ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.79, <i>p</i> = 0.021). We conclude that IMs have lower tolerance and higher incidence of metoprolol-related adverse events than NMs in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases. <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping is justifiable in elderly patients to minimize the risk of adverse events and ensure the benefits of metoprolol.	504	507	CANCER	NMs

Logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between the <i>CYP2D6</i> phenotype and incidence of adverse events, which were assessed over a 12-week period. In this study, there were 651 (62.7%) NMs, 385 (37.1%) IMs, and 3 (0.3%) PMs. After 12 weeks of follow-up, compared with NMs, IMs had the lower maintenance dose [50.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day vs. 25.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day, <i>p</i> < 0.001] and lower weight-adjusted maintenance doses (0.52 ± 0.25 mg/day/kg vs. 0.42 ± 0.22 mg/day/kg, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and had higher incidence of postural hypotension (6.0% vs. 10.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.006), bradycardia (21.5% vs. 28.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.011), asystole (0.8% vs. 3.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and syncope (2.0% vs. 6.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.001). In logistic regression model, the overall incidence of adverse events was 1.37-fold larger in IMs than in NMs (odds ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.79, <i>p</i> = 0.021). We conclude that IMs have lower tolerance and higher incidence of metoprolol-related adverse events than NMs in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases. <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping is justifiable in elderly patients to minimize the risk of adverse events and ensure the benefits of metoprolol.	1474	1477	CANCER	IMs
Combination drug therapies have become an integral part of precision oncology, and while evidence of clinical effectiveness continues to grow, the underlying mechanisms supporting synergy are poorly understood. Immortalized human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) have been proven as a particularly useful, scalable and low-cost model in pharmacogenetics research, and are suitable for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of synergistic combination therapies. In this review, we cover the advantages of LCLs in synergy pharmacogenomics and consider recent studies providing initial evidence of the utility of LCLs in synergy research. We also discuss several opportunities for LCL-based systems to address gaps in the research through the expansion of testing regimens, assessment of new drug classes and higher-order combinations, and utilization of integrated omics technologies.	257	261	CANCER	LCLs
There is considerable inter-individual variability in the effectiveness and safety of pharmaceutical interventions. This phenomenon can be attributed to a multitude of factors; however, it is widely acknowledged that common genetic variation affecting drug absorption or metabolism play a substantial contributory role. This is a concept known as pharmacogenetics. Understanding how common genetic variants influence responses to medications, and using this knowledge to inform prescribing practice, could yield significant advantages for both patients and healthcare systems. Some health services around the world have introduced pharmacogenetics into routine practice, whereas others are less advanced along the implementation pathway. This chapter introduces the field of pharmacogenetics, the existing body of evidence, and discusses barriers to implementation. The chapter will specifically focus on efforts to introduce pharmacogenetics in the NHS, highlighting key challenges related to scale, informatics, and education.	950	953	CANCER	NHS
Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine interventions hold promise to optimize drug treatment modalities and hence, improve the quality of life of the patients by minimizing the occurrence of adverse drug reactions and/or maximizing drug treatment efficacy. To this end, proper guidance for accurately prescribing the correct drug at the right dose is empowered by major regulatory bodies, namely the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA), and well-recognized research consortia, like the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), that propose therapeutic recommendations after the thorough evaluation of the existing scientific evidence base. In this context, the consistency of these recommendations is crucial for smoothly integrating pharmacogenomics into the clinic. Here, we collected all of the important and clinically actionable pharmacogenomics information provided by the aforementioned renowned sources and documented it in order to assess potential similarities and, most importantly, differences. Our data show that the level of concordance regarding the guidance provided for the same drug-gene association pairs varies significantly, despite the fact that it all derives from a single evidence base. In particular, apart from the expected similarities in a number of association pairs, especially the ones related to cancer genomics, there are still major discrepancies that create confusion as to which guidance should be followed in order to properly inform drug prescribing. This regulatory deficiency calls for the fruitful engagement of the regulatory agencies involved with the contribution of other experts engaged in the field of pharmacogenomics in an effort to harmonize the existing arsenal of guidance for genome-informed drug prescription. The achievement of harmonization would in turn expedite bringing personalized medicine closer to clinical fruition.	1395	1401	CANCER	cancer
Oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy has been the main treatment approach for stroke prevention for decades. Warfarin is the most widely prescribed OAC in the United States, but is difficult to manage due to variability in dose requirements across individuals. Pharmacogenomics may mitigate risk concerns related to warfarin use by fostering the opportunity to facilitate individualized medicine approaches to warfarin treatment (e.g., genome-guided dosing). While various economic evaluations exist examining the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics testing for warfarin, few observational studies exist to support these studies, with even fewer using genotype as the main exposure of interest. We examined a cohort of individuals initiating warfarin therapy between 2004 and 2017 and examined bleeding and cost outcomes for the year following initiation using Mayo Clinic's billing and administrative data, as well the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cost Data Warehouse. Analyses included descriptive summaries, comparison of characteristics across exposure groups, reporting of crude outcomes, and multivariate analyses. We included N = 1,143 patients for analyses. Just over a third of our study population (34.9%) carried a warfarin-sensitive phenotype. Sensitive individuals differed in their baseline characteristics by being of older age and having a higher number of comorbid conditions; myocardial infarction, diabetes, and cancer in particular. The occurrence of bleeding events was not significantly different across exposure groups. No significant differences across exposure groups existed in either the likelihood of incurring all-cause healthcare costs or in the magnitude of those costs. Warfarin-sensitive individuals were no more likely to utilize cardiovascular-related healthcare services; however, they had lower total and inpatient cardiovascular-related costs compared to warfarin-insensitive patients. No significant differences existed in any other categories of costs. We found limited evidence that warfarin-sensitive individuals have different healthcare spending than warfarin-insensitive individuals. Additional real-world studies are needed to support the traditional economic evaluations currently existing in the literature.	860	864	CANCER	Mayo

Esophageal cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies. Surgical resection of the tumor from the primary site has been the standard treatment, especially for localized squamous cell carcinoma, but considerable clinical efforts during the last decade have resulted in novel courses of treatment. These options include chemoradiotherapy, consisting of a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin (CDDP), and concurrent radiation. Given the substantial inter- and/or intra-individual variation in clinical outcome, future improvements will likely require the incorporation of a novel anticancer drug, pharmacokinetically guided administration of CDDP or 5-FU, and identification of potential responders by patient genetic profiling prior to treatment. In this review, the latest information on incidence, risk factors, biomarkers, therapeutic strategies, and the pharmacokinetically guided or genotype-guided administration of CDDP and 5-FU is summarized for future individualization of esophageal cancer treatment.	0	17	CANCER	Esophageal cancer

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) models can serve as a powerful framework for predicting the influence as well as the interaction of formulation, genetic polymorphism and co-medication on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug substances. In this study, flurbiprofen, a potent non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, was chosen as a model drug. Flurbiprofen has absolute bioavailability of ~95% and linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 50-300 mg. Its absorption is considered variable and complex, often associated with double peak phenomena, and its pharmacokinetics are characterized by high inter-subject variability, mainly due to its metabolism by the polymorphic CYP2C9 (fmCYP2C9 ≥ 0.71). In this study, by leveraging <i>in vitro, in silico</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data, an integrated PBPK/PD model with mechanistic absorption was developed and evaluated against clinical data from PK, PD, drug-drug and gene-drug interaction studies. The PBPK model successfully predicted (within 2-fold) 36 out of 38 observed concentration-time profiles of flurbiprofen as well as the CYP2C9 genetic effects after administration of different intravenous and oral dosage forms over a dose range of 40-300 mg in both Caucasian and Chinese healthy volunteers. All model predictions for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub> and CL/F were within two-fold of their respective mean or geometric mean values, while 90% of the predictions of C<sub>max</sub>, 81% of the predictions of AUC<sub>inf</sub> and 74% of the predictions of Cl/F were within 1.25 fold. In addition, the drug-drug and drug-gene interactions were predicted within 1.5-fold of the observed interaction ratios (AUC, C<sub>max</sub> ratios). The validated PBPK model was further expanded by linking it to an inhibitory <i>E<sub>max</sub></i> model describing the analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen and applying it to explore the effect of formulation and genetic polymorphisms on the onset and duration of pain relief. This comprehensive PBPK/PD analysis, along with a detailed translational biopharmaceutic framework including appropriately designed biorelevant <i>in vitro</i> experiments and <i>in vitro-in vivo</i> extrapolation, provided mechanistic insight on the impact of formulation and genetic variations, two major determinants of the population variability, on the PK/PD of flurbiprofen. Clinically relevant specifications and potential dose adjustments were also proposed. Overall, the present work highlights the value of a translational PBPK/PD approach, tailored to target populations and genotypes, as an approach towards achieving personalized medicine.	807	814	CANCER	vivo</i

Pharmacogenomics is about selecting the "right drug in the right amount for the right patient." In metastatic colorectal cancer, germline pharmacogenomics testing presents a unique opportunity to improve outcomes, since the genes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase metabolizing the chemotherapy drugs, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan are already well known. In a retrospective analysis of the landmark TRIBE clinical trial [(TRIBE - TRIplet plus BEvacizumab multicenter, phase III trial by the Italian Cooperative GONO (Gruppo Oncologico Nord Ovest) group (NCT00719797)], the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was higher in those with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase/UDP-glucuronosyltransferase aberrations and was dose dependent. We aimed to report on the feasibility and the results of incorporating pharmacogenomics testing into clinical practice.	110	127	CANCER	colorectal cancer
Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is the most common treatment for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (m-CRC). Therapy with 5-FU/folinic acid (FA) continues to be a standard treatment in developing countries. Pharmacogenomics allows the tailoring of cancer therapy to the patient.

We undertook this study to evaluate the frequency of MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism and its relationship to the time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in m-CRC treated with 5-FU/FA.	69	110	CANCER	unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer

The pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus can be partly explained by CYP3A5 activity. Our objective was to evaluate a tacrolimus sparing policy on renal graft outcome according to <i>CYP3A5</i> 6986A>G genetic polymorphism. This retrospective study included 1114 recipients with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Genotyping of the 6986A>G allelic variant corresponding to <i>CYP3A5*3</i> was systematically performed. One year after transplantation, tacrolimus blood trough concentration (C0) target range was 5-7 ng/mL. However, daily dose was capped to 0.10 mg/kg/day regardless of the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype. A total 208 <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients were included. Despite a higher daily dose, <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients exhibited lower C0 during follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of <i>CYP3A5*1</i>/- genotype (HR = 0.70, 0.46-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.10) on patient-graft survival. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline was significantly lower for the <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> genotype did not significantly impact the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (HR = 1.01, 0.68-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.97) despite significantly lower C0. Based on our experience, a strategy of tacrolimus capping is associated with a better GFR evolution in <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients without any significant increase of BPAR incidence. Our study raised some issues about specific therapeutic tacrolimus C0 targets for <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients and suggests to set up randomized control studies in this specific population.	151	162	CANCER	renal graft

Allogenic solid organ transplantation has become the routine procedure in patients with end stage organ disease. Although the transplanted organ compensates deficient body functions, its allogenic nature requires institution of immune tolerance, nowadays provided by immunosuppressive drug administration. Both the safety and efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment depend on many factors, and maintaining levels of immunosuppressants within therapeutic range is the essential target for success in graft function preservation. It is obvious that drug and metabolite concentrations depend on efficiency of individual patient metabolism. Recently, many studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between genetic factors, drug pharmacokinetics and therapy outcome, and interindividual variability apparently can be explained, at least in part, by genetically determined polymorphisms of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, transport proteins and also in some cases, drug targets. This review presents the recent state of knowledge in the field of pharmacogenetics related to solid organ transplantation.	10	21	CANCER	solid organ

RNA interference (RNAi) is a process for regulating the gene expression in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silence target genes. siRNA-based therapy as a new molecular treatment approach, offers therapeutic prospects for many common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Nevertheless, the efficacy of siRNA delivery has, so far, remained a challenging issue. This is due to their easy degradation through the circulation system and the difficulties in the intracellular delivery to specific tissues where they silence the target genes. There have been many efforts to develop suitable, safe and effective siRNA delivery systems in the past decades. These efforts specifically aimed to protect siRNA from serum nucleases and deliver it to an intracellular region in the desired target cells. In this context, one of the new and popular approaches is nanovehicle-mediated siRNA delivery systems.	256	262	CANCER	cancer
Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.	9	12	CANCER	COC

Precision medicine has the potential to transform healthcare by moving from one-size-fits-all to personalised treatment and care. This transition has been greatly facilitated through new high-throughput sequencing technologies that can provide the unique molecular profile of each individual patient, along with the rapid development of targeted therapies directed to the Achilles heels of each disease. To implement precision medicine approaches in healthcare, many countries have adopted national strategies and initiated genomic/precision medicine initiatives to provide equal access to all citizens. In other countries, such as Sweden, this has proven more difficult due to regionally organised healthcare. Using a bottom-up approach, key stakeholders from academia, healthcare, industry and patient organisations joined forces and formed Genomic Medicine Sweden (GMS), a national infrastructure for the implementation of precision medicine across the country. To achieve this, Genomic Medicine Centres have been established to provide regionally distributed genomic services, and a national informatics infrastructure has been built to allow secure data handling and sharing. GMS has a broad scope focusing on rare diseases, cancer, pharmacogenomics, infectious diseases and complex diseases, while also providing expertise in informatics, ethical and legal issues, health economy, industry collaboration and education. In this review, we summarise our experience in building a national infrastructure for precision medicine. We also provide key examples how precision medicine already has been successfully implemented within our focus areas. Finally, we bring up challenges and opportunities associated with precision medicine implementation, the importance of international collaboration, as well as the future perspective in the field of precision medicine.	1230	1236	CANCER	cancer
The optimal dose of warfarin depends on polymorphisms in the VKORC1 (the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit (1) and CYP2C9 (cytochrome P450 2C9) genes. To minimize the risk of adverse reactions, warfarin dosages should be adjusted according to results from rapid and simple monitoring methods. However, there are few pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithms that are based on large cohorts from the Chinese population, especially patients with atrial fibrillation. This study aimed to validate a pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithm based on results from a new rapid electrochemical detection method used in a multicenter study. Three SNPs (CYP2C9 *2, *3 and VKORC1 c.-1639G > A) were genotyped by electrochemical detection using a sandwich-type format that included a 3' short thiol capture probe and a 5' ferrocene-labeled signal probe. A total of 1285 samples from four clinical hospitals were evaluated. Concordance rates between the results from the electrochemical DNA biosensor and the sequencing test were 99.8%. The results for gene distribution showed that most Chinese patients had higher warfarin susceptibility because mutant-type and heterozygotes were present in the majority of subjects (99.4%) at locus c.-1639G > A. When the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium algorithm was used to estimate therapeutic dosages for 362 patients with AF and the values were compared with their actual dosages, the results revealed that 56.9% were similar to actual dosages (within the 20% range). A novel electrochemical detection method of CYP2C9 *2, *3and VKORC1 c.-1639G > A alleles was evaluated. The warfarin dosing algorithm based on data gathered from a large patient cohort can facilitate the reasonable and effective use of warfarin in Chinese patients with AF.	1261	1263	CANCER	A.

The threats involved in the long-term opioid treatment of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) have increased notably. Strategies to identify at-risk patients are important because there is no clear evidence showing which screening or deprescription programmes are appropriate. Our aim was to evaluate the evidence provided by pharmacogenetics applied to predict an analgesic toxicity profile in prescription opioid use disorder (POUD) patients participating in an opioid deprescription programme. Pharmacogenetic markers were analysed in an observational, prospective deprescription programme for POUD patients (n = 88) treated for CNCP. It consisted of monitoring visits (baseline, follow-up and final), opioid rotation or discontinuation and the recording of adverse events and suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Variants in OPRM1 (A118G), ABCB1 (C3435T), COMT (G472A), OPRD1 (T921C) and ARRB2 (C8622T) genes were tested by real-time PCR. Ethics committee approved the study. Wild-type OPRM1-AA genotype carriers reported a significantly higher number of adverse events than OPRM1-AG/GG (median [p25-75], 7 [5-11] vs 5 [3-9]), particularly gastrointestinal system events (90% vs 63%) such as nausea (33% vs 0%). Suspected ADRs (affecting 17% of the patients) were three times higher in males than in females (30% vs 11%). The deprescription programme was effective and safe, and it achieved a significant progressive reduction in the morphine equivalent daily dose, strong opioids and other analgesics' use, without causing any changes in pain intensity or opiate abstinence syndrome. OPRM1 gene polymorphisms could identify the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in POUD patients. Deprescription programmes including pharmacogenetic analysis should be considered during the follow-up of this population.	66	76	CANCER	non-cancer
Variation in gene expression has been found to be important in disease susceptibility and pharmacogenomics. Local and distant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been identified via genome-wide association study (GWAS); yet the functional analysis of these variants has been challenging. The aim of this study was to unravel the functional consequence of a gene with a local SNP with evidence for local and distant regulatory roles in cellular sensitivity to cisplatin, one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs. To this end, we measured cellular susceptibility to cisplatin in 176 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from Yoruba individuals from Ibadan, Nigeria. The 276 cytotoxicity-associated SNPs at the suggestive threshold of P ≤ 0.0001 were significantly enriched for eQTLs. Of these SNPs, we found one intronic SNP, rs17115814, that had a significant relationship with the expression level of its host gene, PRPF39 (P= 0.0007), and a significant correlation with the expression of over 100 distant transcripts (P ≤ 0.0001). Successful knockdown of PRPF39 expression using siRNA resulted in a significant increase in cisplatin resistance. We then measured the expression of 61 downstream targets after PRPF39 knockdown and found 53 gene targets had significant (P ≤ 0.05) expression changes. Included in the list of genes that significantly changed after PRPF39 knockdown were MAP3K4 and TFPD2, two important signaling genes previously shown to be relevant in cisplatin response. Thus, modulation of a local target gene identified through a GWAS was followed by a downstream cascade of gene expression changes resulting in greater resistance to cisplatin.	63	70	CANCER	disease
Gender dysphoria is the imparity between a person's experienced gender and their birth-assigned gender. Gender transition is the process of adapting a person's sexual characteristics to match their experienced gender. The number of adults receiving sex hormone therapy for gender dysphoria is increasingly and these pharmacotherapies are increasing being prescribed in a general practice setting. The role of hormone therapy is to reverse or reduce physical sexual characteristics of the birth-assigned gender and enhance and build characteristics aligning to the expressed gender and these therapies apply to both transgender and gender nonconforming patients. Recognizing the options and interpreting the effects of gender transition therapies are fundamental to the discussion and treatment of gender dysphoria. This review summarizes pharmacodynamics, comparative dosing, adverse effects, monitoring, and potential pharmacogenetic influence of current pharmacotherapy. These include the use of 17-beta-estradiol, spironolactone, testosterone, GnRH agonists as well as adjunctive phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. The article also addresses gaps within the published literature including optimal routes of administration for individual patients, risks of malignancy and dosing reductions as transgender patients age.	1256	1266	CANCER	malignancy
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key membrane-embedded receptor proteins, with critical roles in cellular signal transduction. In the era of precision medicine, understanding the role of natural variants on GPCR function is critical, especially from a pharmacogenomics viewpoint. Studies involved in mapping variants to GPCR structures are briefly reviewed here. The endocannabinoid system involving the central nervous system (CNS), the human cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), is an important drug target and its variability has implications for disease susceptibility and altered drug and pain response. We have carried out a computational study to map deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) to CB1. CB1 mutations were computationally evaluated from neutral to deleterious, and the top twelve deleterious mutations, with structural information, were found to be either close to the ligand binding region or the G-protein binding site. We have mapped these to the active and inactive CB1 X-ray crystallographic structures to correlate variants with available phenotypic information. We have also carried out molecular dynamics simulations to functionally characterize four selected mutants.	550	557	CANCER	disease
A postulated role of subcortical neuromodulators is to control brain states. Mechanisms by which different neuromodulators compete or cooperate at various temporal scales remain an open question. We investigated the interaction of acetylcholine (ACh) and oxytocin (OXT) at slow and fast timescales during various brain states. Although these neuromodulators fluctuated in parallel during NREM packets, transitions from NREM to REM were characterized by a surge of ACh but a continued decrease of OXT. OXT signaling lagged behind ACh. High ACh was correlated with population synchrony and gamma oscillations during active waking, whereas minimum ACh predicts sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs). Optogenetic control of ACh and OXT neurons confirmed the active role of these neuromodulators in the observed correlations. Synchronous hippocampal activity consistently reduced OXT activity, whereas inactivation of the lateral septum-hypothalamus path attenuated this effect. Our findings demonstrate how cooperative actions of these neuromodulators allow target circuits to perform specific functions.	658	668	CANCER	sharp-wave
That primaquine and other drugs can trigger acute haemolytic anaemia in subjects who have an inherited mutation of the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene has been known for over half a century: however, these events still occur, because when giving the drug either the G6PD status of a person is not known, or the risk of this potentially life-threatening complication is under-estimated. Here we review briefly the genetic basis of G6PD deficiency, and then the pathophysiology and the clinical features of drug-induced haemolysis; we also update the list of potentially haemolytic drugs (which includes rasburicase). It is now clear that it is not good practice to give one of these drugs before testing a person for his/her G6PD status, especially in populations in whom G6PD deficiency is common. We discuss therefore how G6PD testing can be done reconciling safety with cost; this is once again becoming of public health importance, as more countries are moving along the pathway of malaria elimination, that might require mass administration of primaquine. Finally, we sketch the triangular relationship between malaria, antimalarials such as primaquine, and G6PD deficiency: which is to some extent protective against malaria, but also a genetically determined hazard when taking primaquine.	44	68	CANCER	acute haemolytic anaemia
Metformin is recommended as first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) by all major diabetes guidelines. With appropriate usage it is safe and effective overall, but its efficacy and tolerability show considerable variation between individuals. It is a substrate for several drug transporters and polymorphisms in these transporter genes have shown effects on metformin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Areas covered: This article provides a review of the current status of the influence of transporter pharmacogenomics on metformin efficacy and tolerability. The transporter variants identified to have an important influence on the absorption, distribution, and elimination of metformin, particularly those in organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1, gene SLC22A1), are reviewed. Expert opinion: Candidate gene studies have shown that genetic variations in SLC22A1 and other drug transporters influence the pharmacokinetics, glycemic responses, and gastrointestinal intolerance to metformin, although results are somewhat discordant. Conversely, genome-wide association studies of metformin response have identified signals in the pharmacodynamic pathways rather than the transporters involved in metformin disposition. Currently, pharmacogenomic testing to predict metformin response and tolerability may not have a clinical role, but with additional data from larger studies and availability of safe and effective alternative antidiabetic agents, this is likely to change.	70	73	CANCER	T2D
Interindividual and interethnic variability of drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may be contributed by commonly occurring genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Polymorphisms of CYP2D6 in particular have been associated with effects on tamoxifen disposition and clinical efficacy, with interethnic differences in distribution of functional alleles that affect metabolizer phenotype. Other tamoxifen-related genetic variants of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and sulfotransferase1A1 (SULT1A1) are also briefly reviewed here. Polymorphisms of CYP19A1 (aromatase gene) have been reported to correlate with clinical outcomes from aromatase inhibitors in small studies but require further confirmation. Many studies on chemotherapy are based on hypothesis-generating association studies and need to be validated through larger-scale cooperative group studies. For anthracyclines, polymorphisms in genes such as carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3), ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1), glutathione-related transporter genes, and oxidative stress-related genes have been reported to correlate with clinical outcomes. The pharmacogenetics of taxanes has been extensively investigated, but associations of genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters reported in earlier small studies have not been validated in a recent large clinical trial. Allelic variants associated with gemcitabine, capecitabine/5-fluorouracil, vinorelbine, and platinum disposition are reviewed. No pharmacogenetic studies have been published for targeted agents thus far, although several potential candidate genes warrant investigation. Future pharmacogenetic studies will need to focus on integration of multiple drug pathways to allow a more comprehensive analysis of genetic factors influencing drug efficacy and toxicity.	428	445	CANCER	tamoxifen-related
Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR) is a kind of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs). PDGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) which are small molecule inhibitors targeting PDGFR prevent and block cell proliferation signal transduction pathways.

Vinblastine and vincristine are dimeric indole alkaloids derived from Catharanthus roseus (formerly: Vinca rosea). Their monomeric precursor molecules are vindoline and catharanthine. While vinblastine and vincristine are well-known mitotic spindle poisons, not much is known about vindoline and catharanthine. Vindoline and catharanthine showed weak cytotoxicity, while vinblastine, vincristine, and the semisynthetic vindesine and vinorelbine revealed high cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. This may reflect a general biological principle of poisonous plants. Highly toxic compounds are not only active towards predators, but also towards plant tissues. Hence, plants need mechanisms to protect themselves from their own poisons. One evolutionary strategy to solve this problem is to generate less toxic precursors, which are dimerized to toxic end products when needed. As shown by in silico molecular docking and biochemical approaches, vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine bound with high affinity to α/β-tubulin and inhibited tubulin polymerization, whereas the effects of vindoline and catharanthine were weak. Similarly, vinblastine produced high fractions of mono- and multipolar mitotic spindles, while vindoline and catharanthine did only weakly affect bipolar mitotic spindle formation. Here, we show that vinblastine contributes to cell death by interference with spindle polarity. P-glycoprotein-overexpressing multidrug-resistant CEM/VCR1000 cells were highly resistant towards vincristine and cross-resistant to vinblastine, vindesine, and vinorelbine, but not or only weakly cross-resistant to vindoline and catharanthine. In addition to tubulin as primary target, microarray-based mRNA signatures of responsiveness of these compounds have been identified by COMPARE and signaling pathway profiling.	1382	1389	CANCER	spindle
The key question of precision medicine is whether it is possible to find clinically actionable granularity in diagnosing disease and classifying patient risk. The advent of next-generation sequencing and the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) have provided clinicians and researchers a wealth of data and made possible the precise characterization of individual patient genotypes and phenotypes. Unstructured text-found in biomedical publications and clinical notes-is an important component of genotype and phenotype knowledge. Publications in the biomedical literature provide essential information for interpreting genetic data. Likewise, clinical notes contain the richest source of phenotype information in EHRs. Text mining can render these texts computationally accessible and support information extraction and hypothesis generation. This chapter reviews the mechanics of text mining in precision medicine and discusses several specific use cases, including database curation for personalized cancer medicine, patient outcome prediction from EHR-derived cohorts, and pharmacogenomic research. Taken as a whole, these use cases demonstrate how text mining enables effective utilization of existing knowledge sources and thus promotes increased value for patients and healthcare systems. Text mining is an indispensable tool for translating genotype-phenotype data into effective clinical care that will undoubtedly play an important role in the eventual realization of precision medicine.	258	262	CANCER	EHRs

In recent years, the FDA has approved numerous anti-cancer drugs that are mutation-based for clinical use. These drugs have improved the precision of treatment and reduced adverse effects and side effects. Personalized therapy is a prominent and hot topic of current medicine and also represents the future direction of development. With the continuous advancements in gene sequencing and high-throughput screening, research and development strategies for personalized clinical drugs have developed rapidly. This review elaborates the recent personalized treatment strategies, which include artificial intelligence, multi-omics analysis, chemical proteomics, and computation-aided drug design. These technologies rely on the molecular classification of diseases, the global signaling network within organisms, and new models for all targets, which significantly support the development of personalized medicine. Meanwhile, we summarize chemical drugs, such as lorlatinib, osimertinib, and other natural products, that deliver personalized therapeutic effects based on genetic mutations. This review also highlights potential challenges in interpreting genetic mutations and combining drugs, while providing new ideas for the development of personalized medicine and pharmacogenomics in cancer study.	47	58	CANCER	anti-cancer

Variability in hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes such as 2C19 and 2D6 may influence side-effect and efficacy outcomes for antipsychotics. Aripiprazole and risperidone are two commonly prescribed antipsychotics, metabolized primarily through CYP2D6. Here, we aimed to provide an overview of the effect of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 on side-effects of aripiprazole and risperidone, and expand on existing literature by critically examining methodological issues associated with pharmacogenetic studies. A PRISMA compliant search of six electronic databases (Pubmed, PsychInfo, Embase, Central, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) identified pharmacogenetic studies on aripiprazole and risperidone. 2007 publications were first identified, of which 34 were included. Quality of literature was estimated using Newcastle-Ottowa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) and revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The average NOS score was 5.8 (range: 3-8) for risperidone literature and 5 for aripiprazole (range: 4-6). All RCTs on aripiprazole were rated as high risk of bias, and four out of six for risperidone literature. Study populations ranged from healthy volunteers to inpatient individuals in psychiatric units and included adult and pediatric samples. All n = 34 studies examined CYP2D6. Only one study genotyped for CYP2C19 and found a positive association with neurological side-effects of risperidone. Most studies did not report any relationship between CYP2D6 and any side-effect outcome. Heterogeneity between and within studies limited the ability to synthesize data and draw definitive conclusions. Studies lacked statistical power due to small sample size, selective genotyping methods, and study design. Large-scale randomized trials with multiple measurements, providing robust evidence on this topic, are suggested.	15	38	CANCER	hepatic cytochrome P450
Recent studies have been established high degree of genetic diversity in solid organ tumors among individuals and even between individual tumor cells. This intratumor and intertumor genetic diversity results in a heterogeneous tumor with unique characteristics which potentially allows effective drug therapy. The goal of pharmacogenomics is to elucidate the genetic network(s) that underlie drug efficacy and drug resistance. Advances in targeted and personalized therapy play an increasingly important role in many common cancers, notably lung cancer, due to the high incidence, prevalence, mortality and the greater tendency towards drug resistance seen in these patients. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and or downstream kinase pathways. This has led to the development of highly selective monoclonal antibodies and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) to prevent cancer initiation, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, survival, and invasion. However, resistance to many of these new treatments is induced and further pharmacogenomic analysis has revealed mutations associated with increased or reduced drug efficacy. Combinations of kinase inhibitors or potentially the targeting of cancer stem cells may further increase the success of pharmacogenomics in treating patients with lung cancer.	73	91	CANCER	solid organ tumors

However, resistance to many of these new treatments is induced and further pharmacogenomic analysis has revealed mutations associated with increased or reduced drug efficacy. Combinations of kinase inhibitors or potentially the targeting of cancer stem cells may further increase the success of pharmacogenomics in treating patients with lung cancer.	704	709	CANCER	NSCLC
Recent studies have been established high degree of genetic diversity in solid organ tumors among individuals and even between individual tumor cells. This intratumor and intertumor genetic diversity results in a heterogeneous tumor with unique characteristics which potentially allows effective drug therapy. The goal of pharmacogenomics is to elucidate the genetic network(s) that underlie drug efficacy and drug resistance. Advances in targeted and personalized therapy play an increasingly important role in many common cancers, notably lung cancer, due to the high incidence, prevalence, mortality and the greater tendency towards drug resistance seen in these patients.

Breast cancer arises as a result of multiple interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Conventionally, breast cancer is treated based on histopathological and clinical features. DNA technologies like the human genome microarray are now partially integrated into clinical practice and are used for developing new "personalized medicines" and "pharmacogenetics" for improving the efficiency and safety of cancer medications. We investigated the effects of four established therapies-for ER+ ductal breast cancer-on the differential gene expression. The therapies included single agent tamoxifen, two-agent docetaxel and capecitabine, or combined three-agents CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil) and CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). Genevestigator 8.1.0 was used to compare five datasets from patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, untreated or treated with selected drugs, to those from the healthy control. We identified 74 differentially expressed genes involved in three pathways, i.e., apoptosis (extrinsic and intrinsic), oxidative signaling, and PI3K/Akt signaling. The treatments affected the expression of apoptotic genes (<i>TNFRSF10B</i> [<i>TRAIL</i>], <i>FAS</i>, <i>CASP3/6/7/8</i>, <i>PMAIP1</i> [<i>NOXA</i>], <i>BNIP3L</i>, <i>BNIP3</i>, <i>BCL2A1</i>, and <i>BCL2</i>), the oxidative stress-related genes (<i>NOX4</i>, <i>XDH</i>, <i>MAOA</i>, <i>GSR</i>, <i>GPX3</i>, and <i>SOD3</i>), and the PI3K/Akt pathway gene (<i>ERBB2</i> [<i>HER2</i>]).

Fluoxetine is one of the most prescribed antidepressants, yet it still faces challenges due to high intersubject variability in patient response. Mainly metabolized by the highly polymorphic gene <i>CYP2D6</i>, important differences in plasma concentrations after the same doses are found among individuals. This study investigated the association of fluoxetine pharmacokinetics (PK) with pharmacogenetic variants. A bioequivalence crossover trial (two sequences, two periods) was conducted with fluoxetine 20 mg capsules, in 24 healthy subjects. Blood samples for fluoxetine determination were collected up to 72 h post-dose. Subjects were genotyped and single nucleotide variants (SNV) were selected using a candidate gene approach, and then associated with the PK parameters. Bioequivalence was confirmed for the test formulation. We found 34 SNV on 10 genes with a quantifiable impact on the PK of fluoxetine in the randomized controlled trial. Out of those, 29 SNVs belong to 7 CYPs (<i>CYP1A2</i>, <i>CYP2B6</i>, <i>CYP2C9</i>, <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i>, <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>), and 5 SNVs to 3 genes impacting the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of fluoxetine (<i>SLC6A4</i>, <i>TPH1</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>). Moreover, decreased/no function SNVs of <i>CYP2D6</i> (rs1065852, rs28371703, rs1135840) and <i>CYP2C19</i> (rs12769205) were confirmed phenotypically. Our research contributes to deepening the catalog of genotype-phenotype associations in pharmacokinetics, aiming to increase pharmacogenomics knowledge for rational treatment schemes of antidepressants.	547	560	CANCER	Blood samples
The majority of patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas have advanced disease at presentation, with only 20% surviving beyond one year. Even among the 10% to 15% of patients who present with localized disease, only 20% will be alive 5 years post surgical resection. Systemic therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma to date has failed to provide more than a very modest survival benefit for patients with advanced disease. However, the past decade has seen significant advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, culminating in the sequencing of the pancreatic cancer genome. New generations of therapeutic agents targeting key oncogenic cellular signaling pathways are currently under evaluation in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Although thus far only erlotinib has been shown to improve survival when compared to gemcitabine monotherapy, the authors anticipate that further developments in biomarker analysis and pharmacogenomics, along with the identification of new drugs will help maximize the benefit of novel therapeutics by directing effective use in the future. Herein the authors review the evidence to date for the use of novel cytotoxic and molecularly targeted agents in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and discuss key areas for future therapeutic development.	40	54	CANCER	adenocarcinoma

Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active drug moiety of mycophenolate, is a potent immunosuppressant agent, which is increasingly being used in the treatment of patients with various autoimmune diseases. An understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate in this population should assist the clinician with rational dosage decisions. This review aims to provide an overview of the published literature on the clinical pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate in autoimmune disease and a briefer summary of current pharmacodynamic knowledge, and to identify areas of potential future research in this field. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE databases as well as bibliographies of relevant articles and 'on-line early' pages of key journals. Twenty-six pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies of mycophenolate in people with autoimmune disease were identified and appraised. Twenty-two of these studies used non-compartmental analysis techniques and four used population modelling methods to estimate mycophenolate pharmacokinetic parameters. Seven studies linked mycophenolate exposure to treatment outcomes. Only four studies measured free (unbound) as well as total mycophenolate exposure and only two studies characterised MPA disposition following enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) administration. Across all studies MPA displayed erratic and complex pharmacokinetics with substantial between-subject variability. Based on total drug measurement, the dose-normalised MPA area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 12 h post-dose (AUC12) varied at least five- to ten-fold between subjects. Typical values for apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of MPA during nonlinear mixed-effects modelling ranged from 8.3 to 25.3 L/h. Patient renal function, serum albumin levels, sex, ethnicity, food intake, concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as antacids, metal-containing medications and proton pump inhibitors and polymorphisms in genes encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase were identified in some studies as having a significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate. Typical MPA CL/F values in autoimmune disease patients were generally slightly lower than values published previously in population pharmacokinetic studies involving renal allograft recipients, possibly because of usage of ciclosporin, poorer renal function or lower serum albumin levels in the renal transplant cohort. In a single crossover study involving ten subjects only, significantly higher MPA AUC12 and maximum MPA concentration (C max) and lower MPA CL/F were reported following EC-MPS administration compared to mycophenolate mofetil administration. MPA exposure correlated well with treatment efficacy in patients with autoimmune disease (response to treatment, active disease and disease markers); however the relationship between MPA exposure and adverse events (infectious episodes, haematological toxicity and gastrointestinal symptoms) was unclear. Further investigation is required in autoimmune diseases such as chronic plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis and following EC-MPS administration. The extent of within-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate is largely unknown and potential covariate influences need to be confirmed in studies with large subject numbers. A relationship between MPA and MPA metabolite exposure and toxicity needs to be established. The contribution of pharmacogenetics to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate warrants further investigation, as does the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring. Dosing to achieve a target MPA AUC12 >35 mg·h/L is likely to lead to better efficacy outcomes in patients with autoimmune disease (rather than just giving standard doses, which lead to a wide range of exposures). However, the relationship between mycophenolate exposure and toxicity requires further investigation to determine the upper end of a target AUC range.	2202	2229	CANCER	autoimmune disease patients

Typical MPA CL/F values in autoimmune disease patients were generally slightly lower than values published previously in population pharmacokinetic studies involving renal allograft recipients, possibly because of usage of ciclosporin, poorer renal function or lower serum albumin levels in the renal transplant cohort. In a single crossover study involving ten subjects only, significantly higher MPA AUC12 and maximum MPA concentration (C max) and lower MPA CL/F were reported following EC-MPS administration compared to mycophenolate mofetil administration. MPA exposure correlated well with treatment efficacy in patients with autoimmune disease (response to treatment, active disease and disease markers); however the relationship between MPA exposure and adverse events (infectious episodes, haematological toxicity and gastrointestinal symptoms) was unclear. Further investigation is required in autoimmune diseases such as chronic plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis and following EC-MPS administration. The extent of within-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate is largely unknown and potential covariate influences need to be confirmed in studies with large subject numbers. A relationship between MPA and MPA metabolite exposure and toxicity needs to be established. The contribution of pharmacogenetics to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate warrants further investigation, as does the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring. Dosing to achieve a target MPA AUC12 >35 mg·h/L is likely to lead to better efficacy outcomes in patients with autoimmune disease (rather than just giving standard doses, which lead to a wide range of exposures). However, the relationship between mycophenolate exposure and toxicity requires further investigation to determine the upper end of a target AUC range.	4018	4021	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	AUC
Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies. The classical symptoms of FXIII deficiency span from intracranial haemorrhage to delay bleeding or the staying of chronic wounds in the skin including impaired mucosal healing. In this view, FXIII bridges primary haemostasis, coagulation and definite tissue healing. Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing. Accordingly, adequate FXIII levels can drive and predict the prognosis of complex diseases and the outcome of the associated therapies or interventions. In addition, peculiar pharmacogenetics aspects of the FXIII gene are of extraordinary interest. The present review accounts for the recognized role of FXIII in the healing process and gives some examples on how to use it as prognostic biological/ molecular marker or as potential tailored therapeutic molecule in complex diseases.	629	642	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	cell membrane
<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Osteosarcoma is the malignant bone tumor most common in children and adolescents. Many cytochrome P-450 (CYP) members detoxify anticancer drugs used in osteosarcoma treatment, and thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate <i>CYP</i> polymorphisms in osteosarcoma patients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The present study investigated DNA from peripheral blood from 70 osteosarcoma patients treated with high doses of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. <i>CYP1A2*1F</i> (163C>A; rs762551); <i>CYP2C9*3</i> (1075A>C; rs1057910); and <i>CYP3A5*3</i> (6986A>G; rs776746) polymorphisms were investigated through real-time PCR using TaqMan probes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The <i>CYP2C9*3</i> allele did not present any association with clinical events. The <i>CYP1A2</i> CC/AC genotypes were associated with ototoxicity occurrence (<i>p</i> = 0.041, odds ratio [OR] = 8.4) and high grades of ototoxicity (<i>p</i> = 0.039, OR = 10.7), when compared with patients carrying the <i>CYP1A2</i> AA genotype. The <i>CYP1A2</i> CC genotype was associated with high grades of diarrhea (<i>p</i> = 0.043, OR = 4.6) and fever (<i>p</i> = 0.041, OR = 7.1) in comparison with the <i>CYP1A2</i> AA/AC genotypes. The <i>CYP3A5</i> CC genotype was associated with weight loss (<i>p</i> = 0.009, OR = 3.8) and high grades of hepatotoxicity (<i>p</i> = 0.010, OR = 4.3) when compared with the <i>CYP3A5</i> TT/CT genotypes. The <i>CYP3A5</i> CC/CT genotypes were associated with high grades of vomit (<i>p</i> = 0.013, OR = 10.8), pulmonary relapse absence (<i>p</i> = 0.029, OR = 9.5), and better overall and event-free survivals (<i>p</i> = 0.017, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.1; <i>p</i> = 0.044, HR = 2.5; respectively) when compared with the <i>CYP3A5</i> AA genotype. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b><i>CYP1A2*1A</i> and <i>CYP3A5*3</i> alleles were associated with toxicity events. <i>CYP3A5*3</i> allele was associated with better survival. Thus, <i>CYP</i> genotypes might be promising markers to tailoring treatment in osteosarcoma patients.	362	365	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affects patient outcomes and satisfaction. New research has centered on evaluation of post-discharge and opioid-related nausea and vomiting. Mechanical and drug effects stimulate the release of central nervous system neurotransmitters acting at receptors in the vomiting center, area postrema, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Brain surgery has allowed insight into specific central emetogenic areas. Stimuli from peripheral organs act through afferent vagus neurons and a parasympathetic response causing nausea and vomiting. Opioids stimulate mu receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and cholinergic receptors in the vestibular system. Opioids also affect gastrointestinal (GI) tract mechanics by decreasing gastric emptying, intestinal motility, GI peristalsis, and secretions. Regional blocks and non-opioid multimodal analgesia help to decrease nausea and vomiting. Patient, surgery, and anesthesia factors contribute to risk and degree of PONV experienced. Pharmacogenetics plays a role in gene typing as antiemetic medication metabolism results in varying drug effectiveness. Risk scoring systems are available. Individualized multimodal plans can be designed as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol.	339	346	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	nucleus
The peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are the key components of innate-immunity, and are highly specific for the recognition of bacterial peptidoglycans (PGN). Among different mammalian PGRPs, the PGRP1 binds to murein PGN of Gram-positive bacteria (lysine-type) and also have bactericidal activity towards Gram-negative bacteria (diaminopimelic acid or Dap-type). Buffaloes are the major sources of milk and meat in Asian sub-continents and are highly exposed to bacterial infections. The PGRP activates the innate-immune signaling, but their studies has been confined to limited species due to lack of structural and functional information. So, to understand the structural constituents, 3D model of buffalo PGRP1 (bfPGRP1) was constructed and conformational and dynamics properties of bfPGRP1 was studied. The bfPGRP1 model highly resembled human and camel PGRP structure, and shared a highly flexible N-terminus and centrally placed L-shaped cleft. Docking simulation of muramyl-tripeptide, tetrapeptide, pentapeptide-Dap-(MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap and MPP-Dap) and lysine-type (MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys) in AutoDock 4.2 and ArgusLab 4.0.1 anticipated β1, α2, α4, β4, and loops connecting β1-α2, α2-β2, β3-β4 and α4-α5 as the key interacting domains. The bfPGRP1-ligand complex molecular dynamics simulation followed by free binding energy (BE) computation conceded BE values of -18.30, -35.53, -41.80, -25.03, -24.62 and -22.30 kJ mol(-1) for MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap, MPP-Dap, MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys, respectively. The groove-surface and key binding residues involved in PGN-Dap and Lys-type interaction intended by the molecular docking, and were also accompanied by significant BE values directed their importance in pharmacogenomics, and warrants further in vivo studies for drug targeting and immune signaling pathways exploration.	1213	1218	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	β3-β4
Differentiation blockade is a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A strategy to overcome such a blockade is a promising approach against the disease. The lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms hampers development of such strategies. Dysregulated ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is considered a druggable target in proliferative cancers susceptible to deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) depletion. Herein, we report an unanticipated discovery that hyperactivating RNR enables differentiation and decreases leukemia cell growth. We integrate pharmacogenomics and metabolomics analyses to identify that pharmacologically (eg, nelarabine) or genetically upregulating RNR subunit M2 (RRM2) creates a dNTP pool imbalance and overcomes differentiation arrest. Moreover, R-loop-mediated DNA replication stress signaling is responsible for RRM2 activation by nelarabine treatment. Further aggravating dNTP imbalance by depleting the dNTP hydrolase SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) enhances ablation of leukemia stem cells by RRM2 hyperactivation. Mechanistically, excessive activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling downstream of the imbalance contributes to cellular outcomes of RNR hyperactivation. A CRISPR screen identifies a synthetic lethal interaction between loss of DUSP6, an ERK-negative regulator, and nelarabine treatment. These data demonstrate that dNTP homeostasis governs leukemia maintenance, and a combination of DUSP inhibition and nelarabine represents a therapeutic strategy.	797	800	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Introduction: Alcohol dependence is one of the most important psychiatric disorders leading to enormous harm in individuals and indeed within society. Yet, although alcohol dependence is a disease of significant importance, the availability of efficacious pharmacological treatment is still limited. Areas covered: The current review focuses on neurobiological pathways that are the rationale for recent preclinical and clinical studies testing novel compounds that could be used as treatments for alcohol dependence. These neurobiological mechanisms include the: glutamatergic, dopaminergic and GABA mediated pathways as well as neuroendocrine systems. There is also an interest in the approaches for influencing chromatin structure. Expert opinion: There are several compounds in Phase I and Phase II clinical studies that have produced potentially useful results for the treating alcoholism. Further evaluation is still necessary, and the implementation of Phase III studies will help to elucidate the usefulness of these compounds. It is important that personalized approaches (e.g., pharmacogenomics) are investigated in these later studies, as the efficacy of different compounds may vary substantially between subgroups of patients.	564	577	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	glutamatergic

Cancer drug screening in patient-derived cells holds great promise for personalized oncology and drug discovery but lacks standardization. Whether cells are cultured as conventional monolayer or advanced, matrix-dependent organoid cultures influences drug effects and thereby drug selection and clinical success. To precisely compare drug profiles in differently cultured primary cells, we developed <i>DeathPro</i>, an automated microscopy-based assay to resolve drug-induced cell death and proliferation inhibition. Using <i>DeathPro</i>, we screened cells from ovarian cancer patients in monolayer or organoid culture with clinically relevant drugs. Drug-induced growth arrest and efficacy of cytostatic drugs differed between the two culture systems. Interestingly, drug effects in organoids were more diverse and had lower therapeutic potential. Genomic analysis revealed novel links between drug sensitivity and DNA repair deficiency in organoids that were undetectable in monolayers. Thus, our results highlight the dependency of cytostatic drugs and pharmacogenomic associations on culture systems, and guide culture selection for drug tests.	918	921	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Sequencing the human genome brings new tools for the individualisation of cancer chemotherapy, especially thanks to the identification of polymorphisms of genes involved in anticancer drug metabolism or activity (pharmacogenetics). A few functional polymorphisms have been known for a long time (thiopurine methyltransferase, glutathion S-transferases), but several new ones have been identified recently, at the level of the genes encoding drug targets (thymidylate synthase), at the level of DNA repair enzymes (XPD) or at the level of transport proteins (MDR1). Clinical trials, first on a retrospective basis, then on a prospective one, are implemented to validate this approach.	494	497	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
In spite of the fact that the aging organism is the result of complex life-long gene/environment interactions, making peculiar the susceptibility to diseases and the response to drugs, pharmacogenetics studies are largely neglected in the aged. Altered response to drugs, cardiovascular and metabolic alterations, cancer and dementia are among the age associated ailments. The latter two are the major contributors to illness burden for the aged. Aging, dementia and cancer share a critical set of altered cellular functions in the response to DNA damage, genotoxic stress, and other insults. Aging in higher animals may be influenced by the balance of cell survival versus death, a decision often governed by checkpoint proteins in dividing cells. The paper is mainly focused on one of such proteins, p53 which has been recently shown to be involved in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Within this reference frame we studied p53 in aged controls and demented patients finding that with aging there is an increase of mutant like conformation state of p53 in peripheral blood cells, which is more pronounced in AD patients. As a result of such conformational change, p53 partially loses its activity and may become unable to properly activate an apoptotic program when cells are exposed to a noxious stimulus. Moreover we found that the tertiary structure of p53 and the sensitivity to p53-dependent apoptosis are affected by low concentrations of soluble beta amyloid, the peptide that accumulates in AD brain but also present in peripheral tissues. It is possible that p53 conformers may occur in the presence of misfolded molecules such as, but not limited to, beta amyloid. In particular at neuronal level the altered function of cell cycle proteins may affect synaptic plasticity rather than cell duplication.	544	547	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA

DNA biosensors are attractive tools for genetic analysis as there is an increasing need for rapid and low-cost DNA analysis, primarily driven by applications in personalized pharmacogenomics, clinical diagnostics, rapid pathogen detection, food traceability and forensics. A rapid electrochemical genosensor detection methodology exploiting a combination of modified primers for solution-phase isothermal amplification, followed by rapid detection via hybridization on gold electrodes is reported. Modified reverse primers, exploiting a C18 spacer between the primer-binding site and an engineered single stranded tail, are used in a recombinase polymerase amplification reaction to produce an amplicon with a central duplex flanked by two single stranded tails. These tails are designed to be complementary to a gold electrode tethered capture oligo probe as well as a horseradish peroxidase labelled reporter oligo probe. The time required for hybridization of the isothermally generated amplicons with each of the immobilized and reporter probes was optimised to be 2 min, in both cases. The effect of amplification time and the limit of detection were evaluated using these hybridization times for both single stranded and double stranded DNA templates. The best detection limit of 70 fM for a ssDNA template was achieved using 45 min amplification, whilst for a dsDNA template, just 30 min amplification resulted in a slightly lower detection limit of 14 fM, whilst both 20 and 45 min amplification times were observed to provide detection limits of 71 and 72 fM, respectively, but 30 and 45 min amplification resulted in a much higher signal and sensitivity. The genosensor was applied to genomic DNA and real patient and control blood samples for detection of the coeliac disease associated DQB1*02 HLA allele, as a model system, demonstrating the possibility to carry out molecular diagnostics, combining amplification and detection in a rapid and facile manner.	0	3	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant head and neck cancer type with high morbidity in Southeast Asia, however the pathogenic mechanism of this disease is poorly understood. Using integrative pharmacogenomics, we find that NPC subtypes maintain distinct molecular features, drug responsiveness, and graded radiation sensitivity. The epithelial carcinoma (EC) subtype is characterized by activations of microtubule polymerization and defective mitotic spindle checkpoint related genes, whereas sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC) and mixed sarcomatoid-epithelial carcinoma (MSEC) subtypes exhibit enriched epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion promoting genes, which are well correlated with their morphological features. Furthermore, patient-derived organoid (PDO)-based drug test identifies potential subtype-specific treatment regimens, in that SC and MSEC subtypes are sensitive to microtubule inhibitors, whereas EC subtype is more responsive to EGFR inhibitors, which is synergistically enhanced by combining with radiotherapy. Through combinational chemoradiotherapy (CRT) screening, effective CRT regimens are also suggested for patients showing less sensitivity to radiation. Altogether, our study provides an example of applying integrative pharmacogenomics to establish a personalized precision oncology for NPC subtype-guided therapies.	459	466	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	spindle

<i>Background and</i> <i>Objectives</i>: Codeine requires biotransformation by the <i>CYP2D6</i> enzyme, encoded by the polymorphic <i>CYP2D6</i> gene, to morphine for therapeutic efficacy. CYP2D6 phenotypes of poor, intermediate, and ultra-rapid metabolisers are at risk of codeine non-response and adverse drug reactions due to altered CYP2D6 function. The aim of this study was to determine whether genotype, inferred phenotype, and urinary and oral fluid codeine O-demethylation metabolites could predict codeine non-response following a short course of codeine. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: There were 131 Caucasians with persistent pain enrolled. Baseline assessments were recorded, prohibited medications ceased, and DNA sampling completed before commencing codeine 30 mg QDS for 5 days. Day 4 urine samples were collected 1-2 h post morning dose for codeine O-demethylation metabolites analysis. Final pain assessments were conducted on day 5. <i>Results</i>: None of the poor, intermediate, ultra-rapid metabolisers and only 24.5% of normal metabolisers responded to codeine. A simple scoring system to predict analgesic response from day 4 urinary metabolites was devised with overall prediction success of 79% (sensitivity 0.8, specificity 0.78) for morphine and 79% (sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.83) for morphine:creatinine ratio. <i>Conclusions</i>: In conclusion, this study provides tentative evidence that day 4 urinary codeine O-demethylation metabolites could predict non-response following a short course of codeine and could be utilised in the clinical assessment of codeine response at the point of care to improve analgesic efficacy and safety in codeine therapy. We offer a scoring system to predict codeine response from urinary morphine and urinary morphine:creatinine ratio collected on the morning of day 4 of codeine 30 mg QDS, but this requires validation before it could be considered for use to assess codeine response in clinical practice.	725	728	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Although in recent years, chemotherapeutic options for colorectal carcinoma have expanded, overall response rates are still too low, with high rates of toxicity. Pharmacogenetics aim at predicting both treatment response and adverse effects in individual patients. This review describes the current knowledge of pharmacogenetic markers in the systemic treatment of colorectal cancer. UGT1A1*28 leads to reduced conjugation of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, resulting in an increased rate of adverse effects, especially neutropenia. To a lesser extent, increased 5-FU toxicity is predicted by DPYD*2A. A variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism in the thymidylate synthase enhancer region, in combination with a single nucleotide polymorphism C>G, may predict poorer response to 5-FU. Efficacy of oxaliplatin is influenced by polymorphisms in components of DNA repair systems, such as ERCC1 and XRCC1. Polymorphic changes in the endothelial growth factor receptor probably predict cetuximab efficacy. Furthermore, the antibody-depended cell-mediated cytotoxic effect of cetuximab may be reduced by polymorphisms in the immunoglobin G fragment C receptors. Bevacizumab efficacy is suspected to be influenced by polymorphisms in the VEGF gene and the hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha gene. Although the interpretation of pharmacogenetic studies is complicated, results imply a promising way of pretreatment prediction of chemotherapy efficacy and toxicity.	875	878	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA

This review discusses advances in DNA sequencing that have been applied to benign hematologic disorders, including those affecting the red blood cell, the neutrophil, and other white blood cell lineages. Relevant examples of how these approaches have been used for disease diagnosis, gene discovery, and studying complex traits are provided. High-throughput DNA sequencing technology holds significant promise for impacting clinical care. This includes development of improved disease detection and diagnosis, better understanding of disease progression and stratification of risk of disease-specific complications, and development of improved therapeutic strategies, particularly patient-specific pharmacogenomics-based therapy, with monitoring of therapy by genomic biomarkers.	58	61	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA

The development of novel technologies for high-throughput DNA sequencing is having a major impact on our ability to measure and define normal and pathologic variation in humans. This review discusses advances in DNA sequencing that have been applied to benign hematologic disorders, including those affecting the red blood cell, the neutrophil, and other white blood cell lineages. Relevant examples of how these approaches have been used for disease diagnosis, gene discovery, and studying complex traits are provided.

Early prediction of clearance mechanisms allows for the rapid progression of drug discovery and development programs, and facilitates risk assessment of the pharmacokinetic variability associated with drug interactions and pharmacogenomics. Here we propose a scientific framework--Extended Clearance Classification System (ECCS)--which can be used to predict the predominant clearance mechanism (rate-determining process) based on physicochemical properties and passive membrane permeability. Compounds are classified as: Class 1A--metabolism as primary systemic clearance mechanism (high permeability acids/zwitterions with molecular weight (MW) ≤400 Da), Class 1B--transporter-mediated hepatic uptake as primary systemic clearance mechanism (high permeability acids/zwitterions with MW >400 Da), Class 2--metabolism as primary clearance mechanism (high permeability bases/neutrals), Class 3A--renal clearance (low permeability acids/zwitterions with MW ≤400 Da), Class 3B--transporter mediated hepatic uptake or renal clearance (low permeability acids/zwitterions with MW >400 Da), and Class 4--renal clearance (low permeability bases/neutrals). The performance of the ECCS framework was validated using 307 compounds with single clearance mechanism contributing to ≥70% of systemic clearance. The apparent permeability across clonal cell line of Madin - Darby canine kidney cells, selected for low endogenous efflux transporter expression, with a cut-off of 5 × 10(-6) cm/s was used for permeability classification, and the ionization (at pH7) was assigned based on calculated pKa. The proposed scheme correctly predicted the rate-determining clearance mechanism to be either metabolism, hepatic uptake or renal for ~92% of total compounds. We discuss the general characteristics of each ECCS class, as well as compare and contrast the framework with the biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) and the biopharmaceutics drug disposition classification system (BDDCS). Collectively, the ECCS framework is valuable in early prediction of clearance mechanism and can aid in choosing the right preclinical tool kit and strategy for optimizing drug exposure and evaluating clinical risk of pharmacokinetic variability caused by drug interactions and pharmacogenomics.	470	478	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	membrane
Experimental studies have demonstrated that methylphenidate (MPH) modulates the synaptic vesicle trafficking and synaptotagmin-1 (SytI) mRNA levels. SytI is a regulatory protein of the SNARE complex, a neurotransmitter exocytosis mediator. Despite this evidence, most SNARE complex-related genes have never been evaluated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) pharmacogenetics. This study evaluates, for we believe the first time, polymorphisms on the SNARE complex-related genes STX1A (rs2228607), VAMP2 (26bp Ins/Del) and SYT1 (rs1880867 and rs2251214) on the response to immediate-release methylphenidate (IR-MPH) in a naturalistic sample of adults with ADHD. The sample comprised 433 subjects, of which 272 (62.8%) have completed the short-term IR-MPH treatment (at least 30 days). The main outcome measure was the categorical variable of short-term response to IR-MPH based on the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Rating Scale version 4 (SNAP-IV), and on the clinical global impression-improvement scale. Additional analyses evaluated the percentage of SNAP-IV symptom reduction for each dimension as well as short- and long- (7 years) term treatment persistence. SYT1-rs2251214 was associated with the categorical short-term response to IR-MPH (P=0.006, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.028), and with the percentage of inattention and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms reduction (P=0.007, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.028 and P=0.017, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.048, respectively). SYT1-rs2251214 was also associated with short-term treatment persistence (P=0.018, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.048), and with months of treatment (P=0.002, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.016) in the long-term protocol. Our findings suggest that SYT1-rs2251214 presents a broad influence in IR-MPH response variability in adults with ADHD, being involved with both symptom response and treatment persistence. If such findings are replicated, SytI could represent a key element in MPH pharmacodynamics in adults with ADHD.	80	96	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	synaptic vesicle
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous malignancy that is primarily treated with combinations of cytarabine and anthracyclines. Although this scheme remains effective in most of the patients, variability of outcomes in patients has been partly related with their genetic variability. Several pharmacogenetic studies have analyzed the impact of polymorphisms in genes encoding transporters, metabolizers or molecular targets of chemotherapy agents. A systematic review on all eligible studies was carried out in order to estimate the effect of polymorphisms of anthracyclines and cytarabine pathways on efficacy and toxicity of AML treatment. Other emerging genes recently studied in AML, such as DNA repair genes, genes potentially related to chemotherapy response or AML prognosis, have also been included.	733	736	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Genetic variation in genes encoding cytochrome <i>P450</i> enzymes has important clinical implications for drug metabolism. Bioinformatics algorithms for genotyping these highly polymorphic genes using high-throughput sequence data and automating phenotype prediction have recently been developed. The <i>CYP2D6</i> gene is often used as a model during the validation of these algorithms due to its clinical importance, high polymorphism, and structural variations. However, the validation process is often limited to common star alleles due to scarcity of reference datasets. In addition, there has been no comprehensive benchmark of these algorithms to date. We performed a systematic comparison of three star allele calling algorithms using 4618 simulations as well as 75 whole-genome sequence samples from the GeT-RM project. Overall, we found that Aldy and Astrolabe are better suited to call both common and rare diplotypes compared to Stargazer, which is affected by population structure. Aldy was the best performing algorithm in calling <i>CYP2D6</i> structural variants followed by Stargazer, whereas Astrolabe had limitations especially in calling hybrid rearrangements. We found that ensemble genotyping, characterised by taking a consensus of genotypes called by all three algorithms, has higher haplotype concordance but it is prone to ambiguities whenever complete discrepancies between the tools arise. Further, we evaluated the effects of sequencing coverage and indel misalignment on genotyping accuracy. Our account of the strengths and limitations of these algorithms is extremely important to clinicians and researchers in the pharmacogenomics and precision medicine communities looking to haplotype <i>CYP2D6</i> and other pharmacogenes using high-throughput sequencing data.	36	46	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	cytochrome
Background.  Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) identify genetic associations across multiple phenotypes. Clinical trials offer opportunities for PheWAS to identify pharmacogenomic associations. We describe the first PheWAS to use genome-wide genotypic data and to utilize human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinical trials data. As proof-of-concept, we focused on baseline laboratory phenotypes from antiretroviral therapy-naive individuals. Methods.  Data from 4 AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) studies were split into 2 datasets: Dataset I (1181 individuals from protocol A5202) and Dataset II (1366 from protocols A5095, ACTG 384, and A5142). Final analyses involved 2547 individuals and 5 954 294 imputed polymorphisms. We calculated comprehensive associations between these polymorphisms and 27 baseline laboratory phenotypes. Results.  A total of 10 584 (0.17%) polymorphisms had associations with P < .01 in both datasets and with the same direction of association. Twenty polymorphisms replicated associations with identical or related phenotypes reported in the Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies, including several not previously reported in HIV-positive cohorts. We also identified several possibly novel associations. Conclusions.  These analyses define PheWAS properties and principles with baseline laboratory data from HIV clinical trials. This approach may be useful for evaluating on-treatment HIV clinical trials data for associations with various clinical phenotypes.	13	25	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	Phenome-Wide
Several pathological mutations have been identified in human POLG gene, encoding for the catalytic subunit of Pol γ, the solely mitochondrial replicase in animals and fungi. However, little is known regarding non-pathological polymorphisms found in this gene. Here we studied, in the yeast model Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eight human polymorphisms. We found that most of them are not neutral but enhanced both mtDNA extended mutability and the accumulation of mtDNA point mutations, either alone or in combination with a pathological mutation. In addition, we found that the presence of some SNPs increased the stavudine and/or zalcitabine-induced mtDNA mutability and instability.	128	141	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	mitochondrial

Pharmacogenomics(PGx) is believed to be the driver for adopting pre-emptive clinical genetic testing. We investigated two potential resources for enabling automated pharmacogenomic decision support. First, we analyzed pharmacogenomics dosing guidelines (PDGs) and how they might be executed to provide alerts for clinicians ordering drugs. Second, we use whole genome sequencing (WGS) data instead of genotyping arrays to obtain patients' genetic profiles. In a pilot study, we attempted to generate clinical recommendations (based on PDGs) for 69 patients whose genomes were obtained from a public data set provided by Compete Genomics. We report on the generated recommendations and the additional variations detected by WGS that are not well addressed by existing guidelines.	361	367	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome
Pharmacogenomics aims to reveal variants associated with drug response phenotypes. Genes whose roles involve the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs, are highly polymorphic between populations. High coverage whole genome sequencing showed that a large proportion of the variants for these genes are rare in African populations. This study investigated the impact of such variants on protein structure to assess their functional importance. We used genetic data of <i>CYP3A5</i> from 458 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa to conduct a structural bioinformatics analysis. Five missense variants were modeled and microsecond scale molecular dynamics simulations were conducted for each, as well as for the CYP3A5 wildtype and the Y53C variant, which has a known deleterious impact on enzyme activity. The binding of ritonavir and artemether to CYP3A5 variant structures was also evaluated. Our results showed different conformational characteristics between all the variants. No significant structural changes were noticed. However, the genetic variability seemed to act on the plasticity of the protein. The impact on drug binding might be drug dependant. We concluded that rare variants hold relevance in determining the pharmacogenomics properties of populations. This could have a significant impact on precision medicine applications in sub-Saharan Africa.	239	245	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome
This study was aimed to investigate the prevalence of CYP2C9*2 (p.430C > T, rs1799853), CYP2C9*3 (p.1075A > C, rs1057910), CYP4F2*3 (p.1297G > A, rs2108622), CYP2C19*2 (p.681G > A, rs4244285), CYP2C19*3 (p.636G > A, rs4986893), CYP2C19*17 (p.1260C > A, rs12248560), ABCB1 (p.3435C > T, rs1045642), CYP2D6*4 (p.1846G > A, rs3892097), SLCO1B1*5 (p.521T > C, rs4149056) and CES1 (p.1168-33A > C, rs2244613) among Tatars and Balkars ethnic groups living in Russia to provide a basis for future clinical studies concerning on understanding of population-level differences in drug response. The study involved 341 apparently healthy, unrelated, and chronic medication-free volunteers of both sexes of ethnic groups of Tatars and Balkars living in Volga and Caucasus regions of Russia. Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction-based methods. The allelic prevalence of studied markers in ethnic groups were compared with Russians as a largest ethnic group in Russia. Statistically significant differences for the following gene polymorphisms were found between both ethnic groups in respect of different markers and with Russians. Our study shows differences in prevalence of the main relevant pharmacogenetic markers in Tatars and Balkars. These findings should be taken into consideration for personalization algorithms development and pharmacogenetics implementation in regions with ethnic minorities as Russia has.	333	340	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	SLCO1B1
In spite of promising preclinical results there is a decreasing number of new registered medications in major depression. The main reason behind this fact is the lack of confirmation in clinical studies for the assumed, and in animals confirmed, therapeutic results. This suggests low predictive value of animal studies for central nervous system disorders. One solution for identifying new possible targets is the application of genetics and genomics, which may pinpoint new targets based on the effect of genetic variants in humans. The present review summarizes such research focusing on depression and its therapy. The inconsistency between most genetic studies in depression suggests, first of all, a significant role of environmental stress. Furthermore, effect of individual genes and polymorphisms is weak, therefore gene x gene interactions or complete biochemical pathways should be analyzed. Even genes encoding target proteins of currently used antidepressants remain non-significant in genome-wide case control investigations suggesting no main effect in depression, but rather an interaction with stress. The few significant genes in GWASs are related to neurogenesis, neuronal synapse, cell contact and DNA transcription and as being nonspecific for depression are difficult to harvest pharmacologically. Most candidate genes in replicable gene x environment interactions, on the other hand, are connected to the regulation of stress and the HPA axis and thus could serve as drug targets for depression subgroups characterized by stress-sensitivity and anxiety while other risk polymorphisms such as those related to prominent cognitive symptoms in depression may help to identify additional subgroups and their distinct treatment. Until these new targets find their way into therapy, the optimization of current medications can be approached by pharmacogenomics, where metabolizing enzyme polymorphisms remain prominent determinants of therapeutic success.	1218	1221	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Data on frequency of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in the UK population are limited. However, availability of whole genome sequencing data on 94 UK controls of European ethnicity from the 1000 genomes project together with similar data on other populations provides a valuable new source of data in this area and allows direct comparison of allele frequencies with those for other European populations. The ethnic diversity of the UK population also needs to be considered, and 1000 genomes includes data on South Asians, the most common ethnic group in the UK after White Europeans. Allele frequencies for polymorphisms in genes relevant to phase I and phase II drug metabolism for UK, Finnish, Spanish and South Asian populations were obtained from the literature and 1000 genomes. Generally there was good agreement between the literature and 1000 genomes reports. CYP2D6*4, the most common CYP2D6 poor metabolizer allele among Europeans, appears more common in the UK than in Spain and Finland, whereas, as suggested previously, CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C9*2 appear more common in Finland and Spain, respectively, than in the UK. South Asians show low frequencies of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C19*17 but higher frequencies of CYP2C19*2 compared with UK residents of European ethnicity. Though personalizing drug treatment on the basis of individual genotype rather than ethnicity may be more appropriate, differences in allele frequencies across continents should be considered when designing clinical trials of new drugs.	116	122	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome
From the perspective of current and future patients, the development of the field of pharmacogenetics is of immense interest. The encouraging vision that is now being established is that we may move from trial and error therapies to evidence-based personalized medicine in clinical practice. However, research and the application of pharmacogenetics to clinical practice are believed to raise a host of controversial ethical issues. Some of these are related to the research process, for example, confidentiality and informed consent in association with human tissue sampling. Other issues arise on a societal level, for example, issues regarding justice and the use of race or ethnicity as proxies for genotyping. In this perspective, I comment on this debate and also suggest what we may learn from previous discussions regarding DNA testing and gene transfer methods. Arguably, the most important ethical perspective in medical research and drug development is related to the interests of patients wanting medical treatment that is both effective and carries low risks of adverse effects. Risk:benefit ratios must always be compared with existing alternatives, and while the risk of adverse effects may be tolerable for some individuals, owing to genetic reasons, this may not be relevant for others. This will have consequences for regulatory policies regarding drug development. In the future, personalized medicine will also need to take epigenetic and environmental factors into consideration.	832	835	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Data variability is a costly complication of biomedical experimentation because the same experiment must be repeated a sufficient number of times so that the sample mean becomes a credible representation of the entire population. Since sampling is ideally done randomly in populations normalized for environmental and genetic backgrounds, data variability is viewed as a purely statistical issue reflecting the distribution in the population and captured as the standard deviation of the sampled data. The factors contributing to data variability are not analyzed by statistical methods; for want of a better explanation, data scatter is simply attributed to random noise and/or methodological limitations. In this commentary, evidence is discussed that documents an important role of interindividual biological diversity as a cause for data variability based on studies in which repeated sampling in the same individual permitted statistical comparisons between individuals in the same sample. Significant differences were found for proximal fluid reabsorption and plasma renin concentration between sample means of individuals of the same population. Furthermore, arterial blood pressure varied significantly between individual mice independently of strain and sex. Recognition of the extent of interindividual variability has important implications for data reproducibility, data collection, and data presentation in physiological research. Such nonrandom data variability may have different causes, but DNA modifications by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms could generate phenotype variants without being associated with disease symptoms. Exploration of the heritability of phenotypical diversity in physiology may be defined as "physiogenetics," and it would thus be the physiological corollary of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics.	1507	1510	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Sensory systems sequentially extract increasingly complex features. ON and OFF pathways, for example, encode increases or decreases of a stimulus from a common input. This ON/OFF pathway split is thought to occur at individual synaptic connections through a sign-inverting synapse in one of the pathways. Here, we show that ON selectivity is a multisynaptic process in the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system. A pharmacogenetics approach demonstrates that both glutamatergic inhibition through GluClα and GABAergic inhibition through Rdl mediate ON responses. Although neurons postsynaptic to the glutamatergic ON pathway input L1 lose all responses in <i>GluClα</i> mutants, they are resistant to a cell-type-specific loss of <i>GluClα</i>. This shows that ON selectivity is distributed across multiple synapses, and raises the possibility that cell-type-specific manipulations might reveal similar strategies in other sensory systems. Thus, sensory coding is more distributed than predicted by simple circuit motifs, allowing for robust neural processing.	457	470	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	glutamatergic

Increased awareness of the cardiovascular toxic effects of chemotherapy has led to the emergence of cardio-oncology (or onco-cardiology), which focuses on screening, monitoring and treatment of patients with cardiovascular dysfunctions resulting from chemotherapy. Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, and HER2 inhibitors, such as trastuzumab, both have cardiotoxic effects. The biological rationale, mechanisms of action and cardiotoxicity profiles of these two classes of drugs, however, are completely different, suggesting that cardiotoxic effects can occur in a range of different ways. Advances in genomics and proteomics have implicated several genomic variants and biological pathways that can influence the susceptibility to cardiotoxicity from these, and other drugs. Established pathways include multidrug resistance proteins, energy utilization pathways, oxidative stress, cytoskeletal regulation and apoptosis. Gene-expression profiles that have revealed perturbed pathways have vastly increased our knowledge of the complex processes involved in crosstalk between tumours and cardiac function. Utilization of mathematical and computational modelling can complement pharmacogenomics and improve individual patient outcomes. Such endeavours should enable identification of variations in cardiotoxicity, particularly in those patients who are at risk of not recovering, even with the institution of cardioprotective therapy. The application of systems biology holds substantial potential to advance our understanding of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.	885	897	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	cytoskeletal
Due to interindividual variability in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, traditional isoniazid fixed-dose regimens may lead to suboptimal or toxic isoniazid concentrations in the plasma of patients with tuberculosis, contributing to adverse drug reactions, therapeutic failure, or the development of drug resistance. Achieving precision therapy for isoniazid requires a multifaceted approach that could integrate various clinical and genomic factors to tailor the isoniazid dose to individual patient characteristics. This includes leveraging molecular diagnostics to perform the comprehensive profiling of host pharmacogenomics to determine how it affects isoniazid metabolism, such as its metabolism by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), and studying drug-resistant mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome for enabling targeted therapy selection. Several other molecular signatures identified from the host pharmacogenomics as well as other omics-based approaches such as gut microbiome, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic approaches have provided mechanistic explanations for isoniazid pharmacokinetic variability and/or adverse drug reactions and thereby may facilitate precision therapy of isoniazid, though further validations in larger and diverse populations with tuberculosis are required for clinical applications. Therapeutic drug monitoring and population pharmacokinetic approaches allow for the adjustment of isoniazid dosages based on patient-specific pharmacokinetic profiles, optimizing drug exposure while minimizing toxicity and the risk of resistance. Current evidence has shown that with the integration of the host pharmacogenomics-particularly NAT2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomics data along with isoniazid pharmacokinetic concentrations in the blood and patient factors such as anthropometric measurements, comorbidities, and type and timing of food administered-precision therapy approaches in isoniazid therapy can be tailored to the specific characteristics of both the host and the pathogen for improving tuberculosis treatment outcomes.	810	816	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome
Although trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity is an important determinant to limit the use of this drug, the molecular mechanism of risk for this toxicity is not well understood. To identify genetic variants determining the risk of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, we carried out whole exome sequencing of germline DNA samples from 9 patients with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, and conducted a case-control association study of 2258 genetic variants between 9 cases (with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity) and general Japanese population controls registered in the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD). The top variant which showed the lowest P-value in the screening study was rs139503277 in PHD Finger Protein 3 (P<sub>min</sub> = .00012, odds ratio [OR] = 51.23). To further validate the result of screening study, we carried out a replication study of 10 variants showing P<sub>min</sub> < .001 in the screening study using 234 independent patients treated with trastuzumab, including 10 cases and 224 controls (without trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity). In the replication study, we observed that three variants had an effect in the same direction as in the screening study (rs78272919 in exon 2 of Keratin 15, rs5762940 in exon 2 of zinc and ring finger 3, and rs139944387 in exon 44 of Eyes shut homologs [EYS]). A combined result of the screening and the replication studies suggested an association of a locus on chromosome 6q12 with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (rs139944387 in EYS, combined P<sub>min</sub> = .00056, OR = 13.73). This finding provides new insights into personalized trastuzumab therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancer.	316	319	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
History suggests β agonists, the cognate ligand of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor, have been used as bronchodilators for around 5,000 years, and β agonists remain today the frontline treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The β agonists used clinically today are the products of significant expenditure and over 100 year's intensive research aimed at minimizing side effects and enhancing therapeutic usefulness. The respiratory physician now has a therapeutic toolbox of long acting β agonists to prophylactically manage bronchoconstriction, and short acting β agonists to relieve acute exacerbations. Despite constituting the cornerstone of asthma and COPD therapy, these drugs are not perfect; significant safety issues have led to a black box warning advising that long acting β agonists should not be used alone in patients with asthma. In addition there are a significant proportion of patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled. In this chapter we discuss the evolution of β agonist use and how the understanding of β agonist actions on their principal target tissue, airway smooth muscle, has led to greater understanding of how these drugs can be further modified and improved in the future. Research into the genetics of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor will also be discussed, as will the implications of individual DNA profiles on the clinical outcomes of β agonist use (pharmacogenetics). Finally we comment on what the future may hold for the use of β agonists in respiratory disease.	1357	1360	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Pharmacogenetics is a study of possible mechanism by which an individual's response to drugs is genetically determined by variations in their DNA sequence. The aim of pharmacogenetics is to identify the optimal drug and dose for each individual based on their genetic constitution, i.e. to individualize drug treatment. This leads to achieving the maximal therapeutic response for each patient, while reducing adverse side effects of therapy and the cost of treatment. A centralized pharmacogenetics service was formed at the Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia (IORS) with the aim to provide a personalized approach to cancer treatment of Serbian patients.	142	145	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Patients with NSCLC are mostly treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, often in combination with radiation therapy. However, the development of chemo-resistance is a major hurdle limiting treatment success. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the genetic factors modulating chemoresistance to platinum chemotherapeutics and their association with clinical outcomes for NSCLC patients. We focus on candidate pathways responsible for drug influx and efflux, metabolism and detoxification, DNA damage repair, and other downstream cellular processes that modulate the effect of platinum-based therapy. We also discuss the application of pathway-based polygenic and genome-wide approaches in identifying genetic factors involved in NSCLC clinical outcomes. Overall, current studies have shown that the effects of each individual polymorphism on clinical outcomes are modest suggesting that a more comprehensive approach that incorporates polygenetic, phenotypic, epidemiologic and clinical variables will be necessary to predict prognosis for NSCLC patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapeutics.	573	576	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA

Genetic alterations in cancer can provide information for predicting a tumor's sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. But although such information is certainly useful, the relatively low frequency of mutations seen in many cancers limits the utility of pharmacogenomics in large numbers of cancer patients, necessitating consideration of other approaches. Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation are a hallmark of human cancers. Methylation of genes involved in DNA repair and maintaining genome integrity (e.g. MGMT, hMLH1, WRN, and FANCF), and cell-cycle checkpoint genes (e.g. CHFR and 14-3-3 sigma, CDK10, and p73), all reportedly influence the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting that DNA methylation could serve as a molecular marker for predicting the responsiveness of tumors to chemotherapy. However, the comprehensive study of pharmacoepigenomics awaits the advent of genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation using microarrays and next-generation sequencers.	384	387	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA

Methylation of genes involved in DNA repair and maintaining genome integrity (e.g. MGMT, hMLH1, WRN, and FANCF), and cell-cycle checkpoint genes (e.g. CHFR and 14-3-3 sigma, CDK10, and p73), all reportedly influence the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting that DNA methylation could serve as a molecular marker for predicting the responsiveness of tumors to chemotherapy. However, the comprehensive study of pharmacoepigenomics awaits the advent of genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation using microarrays and next-generation sequencers.	466	469	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as an important tool for discovering regions of the genome that harbor genetic variants that confer risk for different types of cancers. The success of GWAS in the last 3 years is due to the convergence of new technologies that can genotype hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphism markers together with comprehensive annotation of genetic variation. This approach has provided the opportunity to scan across the genome in a sufficiently large set of cases and controls without a set of prior hypotheses in search of susceptibility alleles with low effect sizes. Generally, the susceptibility alleles discovered thus far are common, namely, with a frequency in one or more population of >10% and each allele confers a small contribution to the overall risk for the disease. For nearly all regions conclusively identified by GWAS, the per allele effect sizes estimated are <1.3. Consequently, the findings of GWAS underscore the complex nature of cancer and have focused attention on a subset of the genetic variants that comprise the genomic architecture of each type of cancer, which already can differ substantially by the number of regions associated with specific types of cancer. For instance, in prostate cancer, there could be >30 distinct regions harboring common susceptibility alleles identified by GWAS, whereas in lung cancer, a disease strongly driven by exposure to tobacco products, so far, only three regions have been conclusively established. To date, >85 regions have been conclusively associated in over a dozen different cancers, yet no more than five regions have been associated with more than one distinct cancer type. GWAS are an important discovery tool that require extensive follow-up to map each region, investigate the biological mechanism underpinning the association and eventually test the optimal markers for assessing risk for a disease or its outcome, such as in pharmacogenomics, the study of the effect of genetic variation on pharmacological interventions. The success of GWAS has opened new horizons for exploration and highlighted the complex genomic architecture of disease susceptibility.	104	110	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome

In recent years, the genomics community has witnessed the growth of large research biobanks, which collect DNA samples for research purposes. Depending on how and where the samples are genotyped, biobanks also offer the potential opportunity to return actionable genomic results to the clinical setting. We developed a preemptive clinical pharmacogenomic implementation initiative via a health system-wide research biobank at the University of Colorado. Here, we describe how preemptive return of clinical pharmacogenomic results via a research biobank is feasible, particularly when coupled with strong institutional support to maximize the impact and efficiency of biobank resources, a multidisciplinary implementation team, automated clinical decision support tools, and proactive strategies to engage stakeholders early in the clinical decision support tool development process.	107	110	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction is frequently reported by individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) on antidepressants, which negatively impacts treatment adherence and efficacy. We investigated the association of polymorphisms in pharmacokinetic genes encoding cytochrome-P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, <i>CYP2C19</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i>, and the transmembrane efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (i.e., <i>ABCB1</i>), on treatment-emergent changes in sexual function (SF) and sexual satisfaction (SS) in the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression 1 (CAN-BIND-1) sample.	360	373	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	transmembrane
The associations between plasma letrozole concentrations and CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genetic variants were tested in the Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenomics (ELPH) trial. ELPH is a multicenter, open-label prospective clinical trial in women randomly assigned (n≈250 in each arm) to receive 2 years of treatment with either oral letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or oral exemestane (25 mg/day). CYP2A6 and CYP3A showed effects on letrozole metabolism in vitro. DNA samples were genotyped for variants in the CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genes. Plasma letrozole concentrations showed high interpatient variability (>10-fold) and were associated significantly with CYP2A6 genotypes (P<0.0001), body mass index (BMI) (P<0.0001), and age (P=0.0035). However, CYP3A5 genotypes showed no association with plasma letrozole concentrations. These data suggest that CYP2A6 is the principal clearance mechanism for letrozole in vivo. CYP2A6 metabolic status, along with BMI and age, may serve as a biomarker of the efficacy of letrozole treatment or a predictor of adverse effects.	449	452	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; 3-hydroxycotinine/cotinine) is an index of CYP2A6 activity. CYP2A6 is responsible for nicotine's metabolic inactivation and variation in the NMR/CYP2A6 is associated with several smoking behaviors. Our aim was to integrate established alleles and novel genome-wide association studies (GWAS) signals to create a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) for the CYP2A6 gene for European-ancestry populations. The wGRS was compared with a previous CYP2A6 gene scoring approach designed for an alternative phenotype (C2/N2; cotinine-d2/(nicotine-d2 + cotinine-d2)). CYP2A6 genotypes and the NMR were assessed in European-ancestry participants. The wGRS training set included N = 933 smokers recruited to the Pharmacogenetics of Nicotine Addiction and Treatment clinical trial [NCT01314001]. The replication cohort included N = 196 smokers recruited to the Quit 2 Live clinical trial [NCT01836276]. Comparisons between the two CYP2A6 phenotypes and with fractional clearance were made in a laboratory-based pharmacokinetic study (N = 92 participants). In both the training and replication sets, the wGRS, which included seven CYP2A6 variants, explained 33.8% (P < 0.001) of the variance in NMR, providing improved predictive power to the NMR phenotype when compared with other CYP2A6 gene scoring approaches. NMR and C2/N2 were strongly correlated to nicotine clearance (ρ = 0.70 and ρ = 0.79, respectively; P < 0.001), and to one another (ρ = 0.82; P < 0.001); however reduced function genotypes occurred in slow NMR but throughout C2/N2. The wGRS was able to predict smoking quantity and nicotine intake, to discriminate between NMR slow and normal metabolizers (AUC = 0.79; P < 0.001), and to replicate previous NMR-stratified cessation outcomes showing unique treatment outcomes between metabolizer groups.	551	575	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	cotinine-d2/(nicotine-d2
Regarding several cytotoxic agents, it was evidenced that genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes involved in their metabolism are associated with higher risk of toxicity. Genotyping these genes before treatment is a valuable strategy to prevent side effects and to predict individual response to drug therapy. This pharmacogenetic approach is recommended for chemotherapies such as thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, thioguanine), irinotecan, and fluoropyrimidines (capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil). In this study, we aimed at developing and validating a fast, cost-effective, and easily implementable multiplex genotyping method suitable for analyzing a panel of nine variants involved in the pharmacogenetics of widely prescribed anticancer drugs. We designed a multiplex-specific PCR assay where fragments were labeled by two different fluorescent dye markers (HEX/FAM) identifiable by fragment analysis. These two labels were used to discriminate bi-allelic variants, while the size of the fragment allowed the identification of a particular polymorphism location. Variants of interest were <i>TPMT</i> (rs1800462, rs1142345, rs1800460), <i>NUDT15</i> (rs116855232), <i>DPYD</i> (rs55886062, rs3918290, rs67376798, rs75017182), and <i>UGT1A1</i> (rs8175347). The assay was repeatable, and genotypes could be determined when DNA sample amounts ranged from 25 to 100 ng. Primers and dye remained stable in a ready-to-use mixture solution after five freeze-thaw cycles. Accuracy was evidenced by the consistency of 187 genotyping results obtained with our multiplex assay and a reference method. The developed method is fast and cost-effective in simultaneously identifying nine variants involved in the pharmacological response of anticancer drugs. This assay can be easily implemented in laboratories for widespread access to pharmacogenetics in clinical practice.	1347	1350	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA

The main advantage of a theoretical approach is essential knowledge of the mechanisms that allow us to comprehend the experimental conditions that we have to fulfill to be able to get the desired results. Based on our research in ultrathin crystal structures performed so far, superlattices, Q-wires and Q-dots, we will consider the materials that can act as carriers for medicines and tagged substances. For this purpose we established a shell-model of ultrathin crystals and investigated their fundamental characteristics. This could be considered as a form of nano-engineering. In this paper we will analyze application of nanomaterials in biomedicine, that is to say we will present the recent accomplishments in basic and clinical nanomedicine. Achieving full potential of nanomedicine may be years or even decades away, however, potential advances in drug delivery, diagnosis, and development of nanotechnology-related drugs start to change the landscape of medicine. Site-specific targeted drug delivery (made possible by the availability of unique delivery platforms, such as dendrimers, nanoparticles and nanoliposomes) and personalized medicines (result of the advance in pharmacogenetics) are just a few concepts on the horizon of research. In this paper, especially, we have analyzed the changes in basic physical properties of spherical-shaped nanoparticles that can be made in several (nano)layers and have, at the same time, multiple applications in medicine. This paper presents a review of our current achievement in the field of theoretical physics of ultrathin films and possible ways to materialize the same in the field of nanopharmacy.	1096	1109	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	nanoparticles
Variations in disease onset and/or severity have often been observed in siblings with cystic fibrosis (CF), despite the same <i>CFTR</i> genotype and environment. We postulated that genomic variation (modifier and/or pharmacogenomic variants) might explain these clinical discordances. From a cohort of patients included in the Wisconsin randomized clinical trial (RCT) of newborn screening (NBS) for CF, we identified two brothers who showed discordant lung disease courses as children, with one milder and the other more severe than average, and a third, eldest brother, who also has severe lung disease. Leukocytes were harvested as the source of DNA, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed. Variants were identified and analyzed using in-house-developed informatics tools. Lung disease onset and severity were quantitatively different between brothers during childhood. The youngest, less severely affected brother is homozygous for <i>HFE</i> p.H63D. He also has a very rare <i>PLG</i> p.D238N variant that may influence host-pathogen interaction during chronic lung infection. Other variants of interest were found differentially between the siblings. Pharmacogenomics findings were consistent with the middle, most severely affected brother having poor outcomes to common CF treatments. We conclude that genomic variation between siblings with CF is expected. Variable lung disease severity may be associated with differences acting as genetic modifiers and/or pharmacogenomic factors, but large cohort studies are needed to assess this hypothesis.	650	653	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA

Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key enzyme in drug response owing to its involvement in the metabolism of ~ 25% of clinically prescribed medications. The encoding CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic, and many pharmacogenetics studies have been performed worldwide to investigate the distribution of CYP2D6 star alleles (haplotypes); however, African populations have been relatively understudied to date. In this study, the distributions of CYP2D6 star alleles and predicted drug metabolizer phenotypes-derived from activity scores-were examined across multiple sub-Saharan African populations based on bioinformatics analysis of 961 high-depth whole genome sequences. This was followed by characterization of novel star alleles and suballeles in a subset of the participants via targeted high-fidelity Single-Molecule Real-Time resequencing (Pacific Biosciences). This study revealed varying frequencies of known CYP2D6 alleles and predicted phenotypes across different African ethnolinguistic groups. Twenty-seven novel CYP2D6 star alleles were predicted computationally and two of them were further validated. This study highlights the importance of studying variation in key pharmacogenes such as CYP2D6 in the African context to better understand population-specific allele frequencies. This will aid in the development of better genotyping panels and star allele detection approaches with a view toward supporting effective implementation of precision medicine strategies in Africa and across the African diaspora.	651	657	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome
Genome-wide association studies have generally failed to identify polymorphisms associated with antidepressant response. Possible reasons include limited coverage of genetic variants that this study tried to address by exome genotyping and dense imputation. A meta-analysis of Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) and Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) studies was performed at the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), gene and pathway levels. Coverage of genetic variants was increased compared with previous studies by adding exome genotypes to previously available genome-wide data and using the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel for imputation. Standard quality control was applied. Phenotypes were symptom improvement and remission after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Significant findings were investigated in NEWMEDS consortium samples and Pharmacogenomic Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS) for replication. A total of 7062 950 SNPs were analyzed in GENDEP (n=738) and STAR*D (n=1409). rs116692768 (P=1.80e-08, ITGA9 (integrin α9)) and rs76191705 (P=2.59e-08, NRXN3 (neurexin 3)) were significantly associated with symptom improvement during citalopram/escitalopram treatment. At the gene level, no consistent effect was found. At the pathway level, the Gene Ontology (GO) terms GO: 0005694 (chromosome) and GO: 0044427 (chromosomal part) were associated with improvement (corrected P=0.007 and 0.045, respectively).

Inheritance plays a significant role in defining drug response and toxicity. Advances in molecular pharmacology and modern genomics emphasize genetic variation in dictating inter-individual pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A case in point is the homeostatic ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, an established drug target that adjusts membrane excitability to match cellular energetic demand. There is an increased recognition that genetic variability of the K(ATP) channel impacts therapeutic decision-making in human disease.	346	354	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	membrane
The biological fingerprint of environmental adversity may be key to understanding health and disease, as it encompasses the damage induced as well as the compensatory reactions of the organism. Metabolic and hormonal changes may be an informative but incomplete window into the underlying biology. We endeavored to identify objective blood gene expression biomarkers for psychological stress, a subjective sensation with biological roots. To quantify the stress perception at a particular moment in time, we used a simple visual analog scale for life stress in psychiatric patients, a high-risk group. Then, using a stepwise discovery, prioritization, validation, and testing in independent cohort design, we were successful in identifying gene expression biomarkers that were predictive of high-stress states and of future psychiatric hospitalizations related to stress, more so when personalized by gender and diagnosis. One of the top biomarkers that survived discovery, prioritization, validation, and testing was FKBP5, a well-known gene involved in stress response, which serves as a de facto reassuring positive control. We also compared our biomarker findings with telomere length (TL), another well-established biological marker of psychological stress and show that newly identified predictive biomarkers such as NUB1, APOL3, MAD1L1, or NKTR are comparable or better state or trait predictors of stress than TL or FKBP5. Over half of the top predictive biomarkers for stress also had prior evidence of involvement in suicide, and the majority of them had evidence in other psychiatric disorders, providing a molecular underpinning for the effects of stress in those disorders. Some of the biomarkers are targets of existing drugs, of potential utility in patient stratification, and pharmacogenomics approaches. Based on our studies and analyses, the biomarkers with the best overall convergent functional evidence (CFE) for involvement in stress were FKBP5, DDX6, B2M, LAIR1, RTN4, and NUB1. Moreover, the biomarker gene expression signatures yielded leads for possible new drug candidates and natural compounds upon bioinformatics drug repurposing analyses, such as calcium folinate and betulin. Our work may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment for stress disorders such as PTSD, that result in decreased quality of life and adverse outcomes, including addictions, violence, and suicide.	1173	1181	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	telomere
Bioinformatics pipelines for calling star alleles (haplotypes) in cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes are important for the implementation of precision medicine. Genotyping CYP genes using high throughput sequencing data is complicated, e.g., by being highly polymorphic, not to mention the structural variations especially in CYP2D6, CYP2A6, and CYP2B6. Genome graph-based variant detection approaches have been shown to be reliable for genotyping HLA alleles. However, their application to enhancing star allele calling in CYP genes has not been extensively explored. We present StellarPGx, a Nextflow pipeline for accurately genotyping CYP genes by combining genome graph-based variant detection, read coverage information from the original reference-based alignments, and combinatorial diplotype assignments. The implementation of StellarPGx using Nextflow facilitates its portability, reproducibility, and scalability on various user platforms. StellarPGx is currently able to genotype 12 important pharmacogenes belonging to the CYP1, 2, and 3 families. For purposes of validation, we use CYP2D6 as a model gene owing to its high degree of polymorphisms (over 130 star alleles defined to date, including complex structural variants) and clinical importance. We applied StellarPGx and three existing callers to 109 whole genome sequenced samples for which the Genetic Testing Reference Material Coordination Program (GeT-RM) has recently provided consensus truth CYP2D6 diplotypes. StellarPGx had the highest CYP2D6 diplotype concordance (99%) with GeT-RM compared with Cyrius (98%), Aldy (82%), and Stargazer (84%). This exemplifies the high accuracy of StellarPGx and highlights its importance for both research and clinical pharmacogenomics applications. The StellarPGx pipeline is open-source and available from https://github.com/SBIMB/StellarPGx.	654	660	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome

Several recent pharmacogenetic studies have investigated the variability in both outcome and toxicity in cisplatin-based therapies. These studies have focused on the genetic variability of therapeutic targets that could affect cisplatin response and toxicity in diverse type of cancer including lung, gastric, ovarian, testicular, and esophageal cancer. In this review, we seek to update the reader in this area of investigation, focusing primarily on DNA reparation enzymes and cisplatin metabolism through Glutathione S-Transferases (GSTs). Current evidence indicates a potential application of pharmacogenetics in therapeutic schemes in which cisplatin is the cornerstone of these treatments. Therefore, a collaborative effort is required to study these molecular characteristics in order to generate a genetic panel with clinical utility.	452	455	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA
Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies. The classical symptoms of FXIII deficiency span from intracranial haemorrhage to delay bleeding or the staying of chronic wounds in the skin including impaired mucosal healing. In this view, FXIII bridges primary haemostasis, coagulation and definite tissue healing. Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing. Accordingly, adequate FXIII levels can drive and predict the prognosis of complex diseases and the outcome of the associated therapies or interventions. In addition, peculiar pharmacogenetics aspects of the FXIII gene are of extraordinary interest. The present review accounts for the recognized role of FXIII in the healing process and gives some examples on how to use it as prognostic biological/ molecular marker or as potential tailored therapeutic molecule in complex diseases.	692	710	TISSUE	granulation tissue

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affects patient outcomes and satisfaction. New research has centered on evaluation of post-discharge and opioid-related nausea and vomiting. Mechanical and drug effects stimulate the release of central nervous system neurotransmitters acting at receptors in the vomiting center, area postrema, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Brain surgery has allowed insight into specific central emetogenic areas. Stimuli from peripheral organs act through afferent vagus neurons and a parasympathetic response causing nausea and vomiting. Opioids stimulate mu receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and cholinergic receptors in the vestibular system. Opioids also affect gastrointestinal (GI) tract mechanics by decreasing gastric emptying, intestinal motility, GI peristalsis, and secretions. Regional blocks and non-opioid multimodal analgesia help to decrease nausea and vomiting. Patient, surgery, and anesthesia factors contribute to risk and degree of PONV experienced. Pharmacogenetics plays a role in gene typing as antiemetic medication metabolism results in varying drug effectiveness. Risk scoring systems are available. Individualized multimodal plans can be designed as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol.	608	621	TISSUE	chemoreceptor
The peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are the key components of innate-immunity, and are highly specific for the recognition of bacterial peptidoglycans (PGN). Among different mammalian PGRPs, the PGRP1 binds to murein PGN of Gram-positive bacteria (lysine-type) and also have bactericidal activity towards Gram-negative bacteria (diaminopimelic acid or Dap-type). Buffaloes are the major sources of milk and meat in Asian sub-continents and are highly exposed to bacterial infections. The PGRP activates the innate-immune signaling, but their studies has been confined to limited species due to lack of structural and functional information. So, to understand the structural constituents, 3D model of buffalo PGRP1 (bfPGRP1) was constructed and conformational and dynamics properties of bfPGRP1 was studied. The bfPGRP1 model highly resembled human and camel PGRP structure, and shared a highly flexible N-terminus and centrally placed L-shaped cleft. Docking simulation of muramyl-tripeptide, tetrapeptide, pentapeptide-Dap-(MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap and MPP-Dap) and lysine-type (MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys) in AutoDock 4.2 and ArgusLab 4.0.1 anticipated β1, α2, α4, β4, and loops connecting β1-α2, α2-β2, β3-β4 and α4-α5 as the key interacting domains. The bfPGRP1-ligand complex molecular dynamics simulation followed by free binding energy (BE) computation conceded BE values of -18.30, -35.53, -41.80, -25.03, -24.62 and -22.30 kJ mol(-1) for MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap, MPP-Dap, MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys, respectively. The groove-surface and key binding residues involved in PGN-Dap and Lys-type interaction intended by the molecular docking, and were also accompanied by significant BE values directed their importance in pharmacogenomics, and warrants further in vivo studies for drug targeting and immune signaling pathways exploration.	409	413	TISSUE	milk
Drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) biotransform several toxins and xenobiotics in both tumor and normal cells, resulting in either their detoxification or their activation. Since DMEs also metabolize several chemotherapeutic drugs, they can significantly influence tumor response to chemotherapy and susceptibility of normal tissues to collateral toxicity of anticancer treatments.	323	330	TISSUE	tissues

Variable phenotypes of androgen insensitivity exist in humans, mainly owing to defective, mutated androgen receptors. A more subtle modulation of androgen effects is related to the CAG repeat polymorphism ([CAG]n) in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene, in vitro, transcription of androgen-dependent target genes is attenuated with increasing length of triplets. As a clinical entity, the CAG repeat polymorphism can relate to variations of androgenicity in (apparently) eugonadal men in various tissues and psychological traits, the longer the (CAG)n, the less prominent the androgen effect when individuals with similar testosterone concentrations are compared. A strictly defined threshold to hypogonadism is likely to be replaced by a continuum spanned by genetics as well as symptom specificity. In addition, effects of externally applied testosterone can be markedly influenced by the (CAG)n and respective pharmacogenetic implications are likely influence indications as well as modalities of testosterone treatment of hypogonadal men.	497	504	TISSUE	tissues
Nephrotoxicity is a dose limiting side effect associated with the use of cisplatin in the treatment of solid tumors. The degree of nephrotoxicity is dictated by the selective accumulation of cisplatin in renal tubule cells due to: (1) uptake by organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and copper transporter 1 (CTR1); (2) metabolism by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and γ-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1); and (3) efflux by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1). The purpose of this study was to determine the significance of single nucleotide polymorphisms that regulate the expression and function of transporters and metabolism genes implicated in development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cisplatin treated patients. Changes in the kidney function were assessed using novel urinary protein biomarkers and traditional markers. Genotyping was conducted by the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System using a custom open array chip with metabolism, transport, and transcription factor polymorphisms of interest to cisplatin disposition and toxicity. Traditional and novel biomarker assays for kidney toxicity were assessed for differences according to genotype by ANOVA. Allele and genotype frequencies were determined based on Caucasian population frequencies. The polymorphisms rs596881 (<i>SLC22A2</i>/OCT2), and rs12686377 and rs7851395 (<i>SLC31A1</i>/CTR1) were associated with renoprotection and maintenance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Polymorphisms in <i>SLC22A2</i>/OCT2, <i>SLC31A1</i>/CTRI, <i>SLC47A1</i>/MATE1, <i>ABCC2</i>/MRP2, and <i>GSTP1</i> were significantly associated with increases in the urinary excretion of novel AKI biomarkers: KIM-1, TFF3, MCP1, NGAL, clusterin, cystatin C, and calbindin. Knowledge concerning which genotypes in drug transporters are associated with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity may help to identify at-risk patients and initiate strategies, such as using lower or fractionated cisplatin doses or avoiding cisplatin altogether, in order to prevent AKI.	1492	1502	TISSUE	glomerular
In spite of the fact that the aging organism is the result of complex life-long gene/environment interactions, making peculiar the susceptibility to diseases and the response to drugs, pharmacogenetics studies are largely neglected in the aged. Altered response to drugs, cardiovascular and metabolic alterations, cancer and dementia are among the age associated ailments. The latter two are the major contributors to illness burden for the aged. Aging, dementia and cancer share a critical set of altered cellular functions in the response to DNA damage, genotoxic stress, and other insults. Aging in higher animals may be influenced by the balance of cell survival versus death, a decision often governed by checkpoint proteins in dividing cells. The paper is mainly focused on one of such proteins, p53 which has been recently shown to be involved in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Within this reference frame we studied p53 in aged controls and demented patients finding that with aging there is an increase of mutant like conformation state of p53 in peripheral blood cells, which is more pronounced in AD patients. As a result of such conformational change, p53 partially loses its activity and may become unable to properly activate an apoptotic program when cells are exposed to a noxious stimulus. Moreover we found that the tertiary structure of p53 and the sensitivity to p53-dependent apoptosis are affected by low concentrations of soluble beta amyloid, the peptide that accumulates in AD brain but also present in peripheral tissues. It is possible that p53 conformers may occur in the presence of misfolded molecules such as, but not limited to, beta amyloid. In particular at neuronal level the altered function of cell cycle proteins may affect synaptic plasticity rather than cell duplication.	1533	1551	TISSUE	peripheral tissues
Next-generation sequencing technology has afforded the discovery of many novel variants that are of significance to inheritable pharmacogenomics (PGx) traits but a large proportion of them have unknown consequences. These include missense variants resulting in single amino acid substitutions in cytochrome P450 (CYP) proteins that can impair enzyme function, leading to altered drug efficacy and toxicity. While most unknown variants are rare, an overlooked minority are variants that are collectively rare but enriched in specific populations. Here, we analyzed sequence variation data in 141,456 individuals from across eight study populations in gnomAD for 38 CYP genes to identify such variants in addition to common variants. By further comparison with data from two PGx-specific databases (PharmVar and PharmGKB) and ClinVar, we identified 234 missense variants in 35 CYP genes, of which 107 were unknown to these databases. Most unknown variants (n = 83) were population-specific common variants and several (n = 7) were found in important CYP pharmacogenes (CYP2D6, CYP4F2, and CYP2C19). Overall, 29% (n = 31) of 107 unknown variants were predicted to affect CYP enzyme function although further biochemical characterization is necessary. These variants may elucidate part of the unexplained interpopulation differences observed in drug response.	797	805	TISSUE	PharmVar
Reported prevalence rates of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are between 8% to 20% in the US general population with an average medical expenditure of US$1.35 billion direct and US$205 million indirect costs. Current pathophysiologic theories are based on abnormalities of both the brain and gut, thus setting a new stage for current and future therapeutic approaches. There are numerous treatment options in IBS acting centrally and peripherally by influencing motility and visceral sensitivity. Clinical evidence is variable; however, newer emerging treatments are being evaluated using better-designed clinical trials. Accurate assessment of IBS drug efficacy is still hampered by heterogeneity of the IBS population. Novel methods such as pharmacogenomics or brain imaging may be helpful in the future to better understand and characterize IBS patient subtypes, and this in turn will lead to more specific and efficient therapeutic options. Patient subpopulation measurement of side effects is also a clinical challenge and further understanding could improve treatment efficacy enhancing the patient compliance.	474	482	TISSUE	visceral
Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis (CRSwNP) affects the quality of life of patients suffering from it. The search for a suitable biomarker has been conducted over the last decades. Interleukin 5 receptor subunit alpha (IL-5Rα) involves the activation, maintenance, and survival of eosinophils, which are highly tied to chronic inflammatory processes of the airways, like asthma or CRSwNP. In this study, we evaluate the utility of <i>IL5RA</i> as a genetic biomarker in CRSwNP. <i>IL5RA</i> mRNA expression level was analyzed in different groups of patients by performing qPCR assays. A significant increase in <i>IL5RA</i> expression was observed in CRSwNP patients, especially those with asthma and atopy. We found differences in expression levels when comparing groups with or without polyposis or asthma, as well as some atypical cases related to eosinophil levels. That opens a path to future studies to further characterize groups of patients with common features in the context of pharmacogenetics and in an era towards developing a more precise personalized treatment with IL-5Rα as a therapeutic target for CRSwNP.	366	373	TISSUE	airways
The combined use of diagnostic and therapeutic radioligands with the same molecular target, also known as theranostics, enables accurate patient selection, targeted therapy, and prediction of treatment response. Radioiodine, bone-seeking radioligands and norepinephrine analogs have been used for many years for diagnostic imaging and radioligand therapy of thyroid carcinoma, bone metastases, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, and neuroblastoma, respectively. In recent years, radiolabeled somatostatin analogs and prostate-specific membrane antigen ligands have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer, respectively. Several candidate compounds are targeting novel theranostic targets such as fibroblast activation protein, C-X-C chemokine receptor 4, and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. In addition, several strategies to improve efficacy of radioligand therapy are being evaluated, including dosimetry-based dose optimization, multireceptor targeting, upregulation of target receptors, radiosensitization, pharmacogenomics, and radiation genomics. Design and evaluation of novel radioligands and optimization of dose and dose schedules, within the complex context of individualized multimodal cancer treatment, requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes clinical pharmacology. Significant increases in the use of these radiopharmaceuticals in routine oncological practice can be expected, which will have major impact on patient care as well as (radio)pharmacy utilization.	377	381	TISSUE	bone

Hypertension is a complex, multifactorial disease; genetic factors represent one third to half of the inter-individual variability of blood pressure values. Among the causes of secondary hypertension are a group of disorders with a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Recent advances in molecular biology have revealed the pathogenesis of hypertension in many of these conditions. Remarkably, the mechanism in every case has proved to be upregulation of sodium Na reabsorption in the distal nephron, with accompanying expansion of extracellular volume. On the contrary in the essential hypertension the underlying pathogenetic mechanism is more complex because of interplay between several 'risk' genes and environmental factors. It is assumed that blood pressure is under the control of a large number of genes each of which has only relatively mild effects. It has therefore been difficult to discover the genes that contribute to blood pressure variation using traditional approaches including candidate gene studies and linkage studies. Recent development of genotyping technology made large scale genome-wide association studies possible. This approach and the study of monogenic forms of hypertension has led to the discovery of novel and robust candidate genes for human essential hypertension, many of which require functional analysis in experimental models. This review summarizes the current findings for candidate genes associated with blood pressure and focuses on recent advances and future potential of pharmacogenetics of hypertension, with the intent to clarify what amount of these investments in basic science research will be delivered into benefits to patients.	486	493	TISSUE	nephron

Paritaprevir (PTV) is a non-structural protein 3/4A protease inhibitor developed for the treatment of hepatitis C disease as a fixed dose combination of ombitasvir (OBV) and ritonavir (RTV) with or without dasabuvir. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 on in vitro PTV metabolism using human recombinant CYP3A4, CYP3A5 (rCYP3A4, rCYP3A5) and human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped as either CYP3A5*1/*1, CYP3A5*1/*3 or CYP3A5*3/*3. The intrinsic clearance (CL<sub>int</sub>, V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) for the production of a metabolite from PTV in rCYP3A4 was 1.5 times higher than that in rCYP3A5. The PTV metabolism in CYP3A5*1/*1 and CYP3A5*1/*3 HLMs expressing CYP3A5 was comparable to that in CYP3A5*3/*3 HLMs, which lack CYP3A5. CYP3A4 expression level was significantly correlated with PTV disappearance rate and metabolite formation. In contrast, there was no such correlation found for CYP3A5 expression level. This study represents that the major CYP isoform involved in PTV metabolism is CYP3A4, with CYP3A5 having a minor role in PTV metabolism.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 on in vitro PTV metabolism using human recombinant CYP3A4, CYP3A5 (rCYP3A4, rCYP3A5) and human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped as either CYP3A5*1/*1, CYP3A5*1/*3 or CYP3A5*3/*3. The intrinsic clearance (CL<sub>int</sub>, V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) for the production of a metabolite from PTV in rCYP3A4 was 1.5 times higher than that in rCYP3A5. The PTV metabolism in CYP3A5*1/*1 and CYP3A5*1/*3 HLMs expressing CYP3A5 was comparable to that in CYP3A5*3/*3 HLMs, which lack CYP3A5. CYP3A4 expression level was significantly correlated with PTV disappearance rate and metabolite formation. In contrast, there was no such correlation found for CYP3A5 expression level. This study represents that the major CYP isoform involved in PTV metabolism is CYP3A4, with CYP3A5 having a minor role in PTV metabolism. The findings of the present study may provide foundational information on PTV metabolism, and may further support dosing practices in HCV-infected patients prescribed PTV-based therapy.	842	845	TISSUE	PTV

A review of the pharmacogenetics (PGt) and pathophysiology of calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 S (CACNA1S) mutations in malignant hyperthermia susceptibility type 5 (MHS5; MIM #60188) is presented. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a life-threatening hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle usually induced by volatile, halogenated anesthetics and/or the depolarizing neuromuscular blocker succinylcholine. In addition to ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) mutations, several CACNA1S mutations are known to be risk factors for increased susceptibility to MH (MHS). However, the presence of these pathogenic CACNA1S gene variations cannot be used to positively predict MH since the condition is genetically heterogeneous with variable expression and incomplete penetrance. At present, one or at most six CACNA1S mutations display significant linkage or association either to clinically diagnosed MH or to MHS as determined by contracture testing. Additional pathogenic variants in CACNA1S, either alone or in combination with genes affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, are likely to be discovered in association to MH as whole exome sequencing becomes more commonplace.	377	390	TISSUE	neuromuscular
Although immunosuppressive treatments and target concentration intervention (TCI) have significantly contributed to the success of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), there is currently no consensus on the best immunosuppressive strategies. Compared with solid organ transplantation, alloHCT is unique because of the potential for bidirectional reactions (i.e. host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host). Postgraft immunosuppression typically includes a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) and a short course of methotrexate after high-dose myeloablative conditioning, or a calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil after reduced-intensity conditioning. There are evolving roles for the antithymyocyte globulins (ATGs) and sirolimus as postgraft immunosuppression. A review of the pharmacokinetics and TCI of the main postgraft immunosuppressants is presented in this two-part review. All immunosuppressants are characterized by large intra- and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability and by narrow therapeutic indices. It is essential to understand immunosuppressants' pharmacokinetic properties and how to use them for individualized treatment incorporating TCI to improve outcomes. TCI, which is mandatory for the calcineurin inhibitors and sirolimus, has become an integral part of postgraft immunosuppression. TCI is usually based on trough concentration monitoring, but other approaches include measurement of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) over the dosing interval or limited sampling schedules with maximum a posteriori Bayesian personalization approaches. Interpretation of pharmacodynamic results is hindered by the prevalence of studies enrolling only a small number of patients, variability in the allogeneic graft source and variability in postgraft immunosuppression. Given the curative potential of alloHCT, the pharmacodynamics of these immunosuppressants deserves to be explored in depth. Development of sophisticated systems pharmacology models and improved TCI tools are needed to accurately evaluate patients' exposure to drugs in general and to immunosuppressants in particular. Sequential studies, first without and then with TCI, should be conducted to validate the clinical benefit of TCI in homogenous populations; randomized trials are not feasible, because there are higher-priority research questions in alloHCT. In Part I of this article, we review the alloHCT process to facilitate optimal design of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies. We also review the pharmacokinetics and TCI of calcineurin inhibitors and methotrexate.	1786	1791	TISSUE	graft
Sensory systems sequentially extract increasingly complex features. ON and OFF pathways, for example, encode increases or decreases of a stimulus from a common input. This ON/OFF pathway split is thought to occur at individual synaptic connections through a sign-inverting synapse in one of the pathways. Here, we show that ON selectivity is a multisynaptic process in the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system. A pharmacogenetics approach demonstrates that both glutamatergic inhibition through GluClα and GABAergic inhibition through Rdl mediate ON responses. Although neurons postsynaptic to the glutamatergic ON pathway input L1 lose all responses in <i>GluClα</i> mutants, they are resistant to a cell-type-specific loss of <i>GluClα</i>. This shows that ON selectivity is distributed across multiple synapses, and raises the possibility that cell-type-specific manipulations might reveal similar strategies in other sensory systems. Thus, sensory coding is more distributed than predicted by simple circuit motifs, allowing for robust neural processing.	258	280	TISSUE	sign-inverting synapse

TNFalpha is a proinflammatory cytokine, which is crucial in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In recent years, biological therapies which block the damaging effects of TNFalpha on synovium and cartilage have been developed. TNF antagonists, such as etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab, although highly effective in RA, are expensive, totaling several thousand US dollars in yearly costs. In addition, only approximately 60% of patients respond to these agents. This has led to the need to prospectively identify patients most likely to respond to these agents, which can be achieved by pharmacogenomics approaches. Polymorphisms in genes encoding for TNFalpha, the MHC region, and the Fcgamma receptor IIIA, as well as their ability to predict disease progression in RA and response to anti-TNF therapies, have been the focus of a number of studies, which are discussed in this review. There is no consensus at present as to whether pharmacogenomics will allow prediction of anti-TNF therapy efficacy in RA. Large, prospective, multicenter studies are needed to replicate and validate the results of the studies outlined in this review.	206	215	TISSUE	cartilage
History suggests β agonists, the cognate ligand of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor, have been used as bronchodilators for around 5,000 years, and β agonists remain today the frontline treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The β agonists used clinically today are the products of significant expenditure and over 100 year's intensive research aimed at minimizing side effects and enhancing therapeutic usefulness. The respiratory physician now has a therapeutic toolbox of long acting β agonists to prophylactically manage bronchoconstriction, and short acting β agonists to relieve acute exacerbations. Despite constituting the cornerstone of asthma and COPD therapy, these drugs are not perfect; significant safety issues have led to a black box warning advising that long acting β agonists should not be used alone in patients with asthma. In addition there are a significant proportion of patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled. In this chapter we discuss the evolution of β agonist use and how the understanding of β agonist actions on their principal target tissue, airway smooth muscle, has led to greater understanding of how these drugs can be further modified and improved in the future. Research into the genetics of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor will also be discussed, as will the implications of individual DNA profiles on the clinical outcomes of β agonist use (pharmacogenetics). Finally we comment on what the future may hold for the use of β agonists in respiratory disease.	1099	1105	TISSUE	tissue
Persons with type 2 diabetes born in the regions of famine exposures have disproportionally elevated risk of vision-threatening proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in adulthood. However, the underlying mechanisms are not known. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the plausible molecular factors underlying progression to PDR. To study the association of genetic variants with PDR under the intrauterine famine exposure, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were previously reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes, glucose, and pharmacogenetics. Analyses were performed in the population from northern Ukraine with a history of exposure to the Great Ukrainian Holodomor famine [the Diagnostic Optimization and Treatment of Diabetes and its Complications in the Chernihiv Region (DOLCE study), <i>n</i> = 3,583]. A validation of the top genetic findings was performed in the Hong Kong diabetes registry (HKDR, <i>n</i> = 730) with a history of famine as a consequence of the Japanese invasion during WWII. In DOLCE, the genetic risk for PDR was elevated for the variants in <i>ADRA2A</i>, <i>PCSK</i>9, and <i>CYP2C19*2</i> loci, but reduced at <i>PROX1</i> locus. The association of <i>ADRA2A</i> loci with the risk of advanced diabetic retinopathy in famine-exposed group was further replicated in HKDR. The exposure of embryonic retinal cells to starvation for glucose, mimicking the perinatal exposure to famine, resulted in sustained increased expression of <i>Adra2a</i> and <i>Pcsk9</i>, but decreased <i>Prox1</i>. The exposure to starvation exhibited a lasting inhibitory effects on neurite outgrowth, as determined by neurite length. In conclusion, a consistent genetic findings on the famine-linked risk of <i>ADRA2A</i> with PDR indicate that the nerves may likely to be responsible for communicating the effects of perinatal exposure to famine on the elevated risk of advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy in adults. These results suggest the possibility of utilizing neuroprotective drugs for the prevention and treatment of PDR.	1799	1805	TISSUE	nerves
When mycophenolic acid (MPA) was originally marketed for immunosuppressive therapy, fixed doses were recommended by the manufacturer. Awareness of the potential for a more personalized dosing has led to development of methods to estimate MPA area under the curve based on the measurement of drug concentrations in only a few samples. This approach is feasible in the clinical routine and has proven successful in terms of correlation with outcome. However, the search for superior correlates has continued, and numerous studies in search of biomarkers that could better predict the perfect dosage for the individual patient have been published. As it was considered timely for an updated and comprehensive presentation of consensus on the status for personalized treatment with MPA, this report was prepared following an initiative from members of the International Association of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology (IATDMCT). Topics included are the criteria for analytics, methods to estimate exposure including pharmacometrics, the potential influence of pharmacogenetics, development of biomarkers, and the practical aspects of implementation of target concentration intervention. For selected topics with sufficient evidence, such as the application of limited sampling strategies for MPA area under the curve, graded recommendations on target ranges are presented. To provide a comprehensive review, this report also includes updates on the status of potential biomarkers including those which may be promising but with a low level of evidence. In view of the fact that there are very few new immunosuppressive drugs under development for the transplant field, it is likely that MPA will continue to be prescribed on a large scale in the upcoming years. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects is relatively common, increasing the risk for late rejections, which may contribute to graft loss. Therefore, the continued search for innovative methods to better personalize MPA dosage is warranted.	1914	1919	TISSUE	graft
Nephrotic syndrome is one of the most common glomerular disorders in childhood. Glucocorticoids have been the cornerstone of the treatment of childhood nephrotic syndrome for several decades, as the majority of children achieves complete remission after prednisone or prednisolone treatment. Currently, treatment guidelines for the first manifestation and relapse of nephrotic syndrome are mostly standardized, while large inter-individual variation is present in the clinical course of disease and side effects of glucocorticoid treatment. This review describes the mechanisms of glucocorticoid action and clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prednisone and prednisolone in nephrotic syndrome patients. However, these mechanisms do not account for the large inter-individual variability in the response to glucocorticoid treatment. Previous research has shown that genetic factors can have a major influence on the pharmacokinetic and dynamic profile of the individual patient. Therefore, pharmacogenetics may have a promising role in personalized medicine for patients with nephrotic syndrome. Currently, little is known about the impact of genetic polymorphisms on glucocorticoid response and steroid-related toxicities in children with nephrotic syndrome. Although the evidence is limited, the data summarized in this study do suggest a role for pharmacogenetics to improve individualization of glucocorticoid therapy. Therefore, studies in larger cohorts with nephrotic syndrome patients are necessary to draw final conclusions about the influence of genetic polymorphisms on the glucocorticoid response and steroid-related toxicities to ultimately implement pharmacogenetics in clinical practice.	45	55	TISSUE	glomerular

Organic cation transporters (OCTs) of the solute carrier family (SLC) 22 are the subject of intensive research because they mediate the transport of many clinically-relevant drugs such as the antidiabetic agent metformin, the opioid tramadol, and the antimigraine agent sumatriptan. OCT1 (SLC22A1) and OCT2 (SLC22A2) are highly expressed in human liver and kidney, respectively, while OCT3 (SLC22A3) shows a broader tissue distribution. As suggested from studies using knockout mice, particularly OCT2 and OCT3 appear to be of relevance for brain physiological function and drug response. The knowledge of genetic factors and epigenetic modifications affecting function and expression of OCTs is important for a better understanding of disease mechanisms and for personalized treatment of patients. This review briefly summarizes the impact of genetic variants and epigenetic regulation of OCTs in general. A comprehensive overview is given on the consequences of OCT2 and OCT3 knockout in mice and the implications of genetic OCT2 and OCT3 variants on central nervous system function in humans.	416	422	TISSUE	tissue
Current strategies to treat type 2 diabetes (DMT2) include reducing insulin resistance using glitazones, supplementing with exogenous insulin, increasing endogenous insulin production with sulfonylureas and meglitinides, reducing hepatic glucose production through biguanides, and limiting postprandial glucose absorption with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. In all of these areas, new generations of molecules with improved efficacy and safety profiles, are being investigated. Promising biological targets are rapidly emerging such as the role of lipotoxicity as a cause of glucometabolic insulin resistance, leading to a host of new molecular drug targets such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators, recombinant adiponectin derivatives, and fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitors. Insulin action can be enhanced in muscle, liver and fat, with small-molecule activators of the insulin receptor or inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase (FTP)-IB. Defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic B-cells could be alleviated with recombinant glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) or agonists to the GLP-1 receptor. This review presents a new approach for obesity and DMT2 drug discovery through pharmacogenomics. Several compounds have already been validated through genetic engineering in animal models or the preliminary use of therapeutic compounds in humans.	844	847	TISSUE	fat
Heterogeneity is the rule among pediatric heart transplant recipients. Patients vary in age, size, organ maturity, immune system maturity and underlying disease etiology, which can all influence post-transplant outcomes. Overall, the survival of pediatric transplant recipients continues to improve and the goal remains long-term survival of the primary graft and mitigation of long-term complications and adverse events. The evolving fields of pharmacogenomics and genomics have the potential to revolutionize and personalize the care of pediatric transplant recipients, and although clinical validation in a pediatric cohort is lacking, many of these technologies are becoming more readily available. We discuss genotype-guided dosing of immunosuppressant medications and other commonly used medications after transplantation, the influence of donor and recipient genotype on risk of post-transplant complications, genotype-guided selection of therapies to treat complications, and the use of next-generation sequencing for noninvasive detection of graft rejection.	354	359	TISSUE	graft

The detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is of increasing importance in many areas including clinical diagnostics, patient stratification for pharmacogenomics, and advanced forensic analysis. In the work reported, we apply a semiautomated system for solid-phase electrochemical melting curve analysis (éMCA) for the identification of the allele present at a specific SNP site associated with an increased risk of bone fracture and predisposition to osteoporosis. Asymmetric isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification using ferrocene labeled forward primers was employed to generate single stranded redox labeled amplicons. In a first approach to demonstrate the proof of concept of combining asymmetric RPA with solid-phase éMCA, a simplified system housing a multielectrode array within a polymeric microsystem, sandwiched between two aluminum plates of a heater device, was used. Sample manipulation through the microfluidic channel was controlled by a syringe pump, and an external Ag/AgCl reference electrode was employed. Individual electrodes of the array were functionalized with four different oligonucleotide probes, each probe equivalent in design with the exception of the middle nucleotide. The isothermally generated amplicons were allowed to hybridize to the surface-tethered probes and subsequently subjected to a controlled temperature ramp, and the melting of the duplex was monitored electrochemically. A clear difference between the fully complementary and a single mismatch was observed. Having demonstrated the proof-of-concept, a device for automated éMCA with increased flexibility to house diverse electrode arrays with internal quasi-gold reference electrodes, higher resolution, and broader melting temperature range was developed and exploited for the detection of SNP hetero/homozygosity. Using the optimized conditions, the system was applied to the identification of the allele present at an osteoporosis associated SNP site, rs2741856, in 10 real fingerprick/venous blood samples, with results validated using Sanger sequencing.	428	432	TISSUE	bone
Human beings come in all shapes and sizes. Heterogeneity makes life interesting, but leads to inter-individual variation in disease susceptibility and response to therapy. One major health challenge is to develop "personalised medicine"; therapeutic interventions tailored to an individual to ensure optimal treatment of disease. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with several different phenotypes triggered by multiple gene-environment interactions. Inhaled corticosteroids and β2-agonists have been the mainstay asthma therapies for 30 years, but they are not effective in all patients, while high costs and side-effects also drive the need for better targeted treatment of asthma. Pharmacogenetics is the study of variations in the genetic code for proteins in signaling pathways targeted by pharmacological therapies. Biomarkers are biological markers obtained from patients that can aid in asthma diagnosis, prediction of treatment response, and monitoring of disease control. This review presents a broad discussion of the use of genetic profiling and biomarkers to better diagnose, monitor, and tailor the treatment of asthmatics. We also discuss possible future developments in personalised medicine, including the construction of artificially engineered airway tissues containing a patient's own cells for use as personalised drug-testing tools.	1263	1277	TISSUE	airway tissues
Several recent pharmacogenetic studies have investigated the variability in both outcome and toxicity in cisplatin-based therapies. These studies have focused on the genetic variability of therapeutic targets that could affect cisplatin response and toxicity in diverse type of cancer including lung, gastric, ovarian, testicular, and esophageal cancer. In this review, we seek to update the reader in this area of investigation, focusing primarily on DNA reparation enzymes and cisplatin metabolism through Glutathione S-Transferases (GSTs). Current evidence indicates a potential application of pharmacogenetics in therapeutic schemes in which cisplatin is the cornerstone of these treatments. Therefore, a collaborative effort is required to study these molecular characteristics in order to generate a genetic panel with clinical utility.	319	329	TISSUE	testicular
Many drugs on the market have the potential to cause undesirable side effects. Biomarkers used today, at best, diagnose an existing injury, such as cell death or abnormal functioning of an organ. More valuable would be biomarkers that could be used to prevent a patient from receiving an inappropriate drug or to identify very early signs of injury so the offending drug may be discontinued prior to overt tissue injury. Biomarkers currently used to identify drug-induced injury to the liver, heart and kidney will be discussed, as will some newer biomarkers. Progress on finding new biomarkers through the use of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomic approaches, consortia that may assist in their discovery and qualification for use, regulatory issues and the pharmacoeconomic considerations that may drive or hinder such new tests are also described.	406	412	TISSUE	tissue
For safe and effective use of antibacterial agents in neonates, specific knowledge on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and its covariates is needed. This necessitates a stepwise approach, including prospective validation. Areas covered: We describe our approach throughout almost two decades to improve amikacin exposure in neonates. A dosing regimen has been developed and validated using pharmacometrics, considering current weight, postnatal age, perinatal asphyxia, and ibuprofen use. This regimen has been developed based on clinical and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data collected during routine care, and subsequently underwent prospective validation. A similar approach has been scheduled to quantify the impact of hypothermia. Besides plasma observations, datasets on deep compartment PK were also collected. Finally, the available literature on developmental toxicology (hearing, renal) of amikacin is summarized. Expert opinion: The amikacin model reflects a semi-physiological function for glomerular filtration. Consequently, this model can be used to develop dosing regimens for other aminoglycosides or to validate physiology-based pharmacokinetic models. Future studies should explore safety with incorporation of covariates like pharmacogenetics, biomarkers, and long-term outcomes. This includes a search for mechanisms of developmental toxicity. Following knowledge generation and grading the level of evidence in support of data, dissemination and implementation initiatives are needed.	1000	1010	TISSUE	glomerular
P-glycoprotein encoded by the ABCB1 gene constitutes a molecular barrier in the small and large bowel epithelium, and its different expression may influence susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to assess the contribution of the C3435T polymorphism to disease risk in the Polish population. A total of 100 patients (50 Crohn's disease (CD), 50 ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 100 healthy controls were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C3435T by using the PCR-RFLP method. Patients were classified on the basis of disease phenotype and the specific treatment used. A meta-analysis was carried out of our results and those from previously published Polish studies. There was no significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies in IBD patients compared with controls. For CD patients, a lower frequency of TT genotype in those with colonic disease, a lower frequency of T allele, and a higher frequency of C allele in those with luminal disease were observed, whereas for UC patients, a lower frequency of CT genotype was observed in those with left-sided colitis. A meta-analysis showed a tendency towards higher prevalence of CC genotype in UC cases. These results indicate that the C3435T variants may confer a risk for UC and influence disease behaviour.	96	112	TISSUE	bowel epithelium

Teratology is the study of anatomical and physiological abnormalities, commonly known as birth defects. If an embryo is exposed to a harmful substance, or teratogen, during the critical period of development, an ensuing malformation may occur. These malformations and their associated mechanisms are studied and analyzed in laboratory animals in order to prevent them from occurring in humans. Rodents, such as rabbits, rats, and mice, have commonly been used in such studies because of their similarity to humans. In 1959, James G. Wilson designed, developed, and tested a protocol on how to observe and analyze structural malformations in rodent fetuses, which included external examination, skeletal evaluation, soft tissue analysis, and data collection/analysis. Although many years have passed since Wilson created this protocol, it is still widely used to this day, and only minor changes have been made to his instructions such as the chemicals used in the experiments and also the analysis of the experimental data. While only minor modifications have been made to this protocol since its beginning, major advances have been made in the dissemination of teratology information to the public such that information is now available through the Internet--information including the identification of an increasing number of teratogens and the understanding of the pathogenesis as it relates to the etiology of birth defects. Despite these advances, however, there has been little decrease in the overall incidence of major birth defects, although significantly improved reporting and ascertainment of birth defects must be factored into the equation in determining birth defect rates. Future birth defect prevention may be based on the understanding of individual genomes and pharmacogenomics, and as the interaction between teratogenic and genetic factors is better understood--with the hope that the incidence of both chemically induced and genetic defects will one day be substantially reduced.	694	702	TISSUE	skeletal

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) represents a common final pathway leading to heart failure. We have searched for genetic determinants of left ventricular (LV) mass using values for absolute electrocardiographic QRS voltage in a healthy Japanese population. After adjusting for covariates, the corrected S and R wave voltages in leads V1 and V5 from 2,994 healthy volunteers in the Japan Pharmacogenomics Data Science Consortium (JPDSC) database were subjected to a genome-wide association study. Potential associations were validated by an in silico replication study using an independent Japanese population obtained from the Nagahama Prospective Genome Cohort for Comprehensive Human Bioscience. We identified a novel association between the lead V5, R wave voltage in Japanese individuals and SNP rs7301743[G], which maps near the gene encoding T-box transcription factor Tbx3. Meta-analysis of two independent Japanese datasets demonstrated a marginally significant association of SNP rs7301743 in TBX3|MED13L with a 0.071 mV (95% CI, 0.038-0.11 mV) shorter R wave amplitude in the V5 lead per minor allele copy (P = 7.635 x 10(-8)). The transcriptional repressor, TBX3, is proposed to suppress the development of working ventricular myocardium. Our findings suggest that genetic variation of Tbx3 is associated with LV mass in a healthy Japanese population.	1229	1251	TISSUE	ventricular myocardium
LCLs are widely used in pharmacogenomic studies and the applicability of LCLs for various clinical phenotypes is emerging. Early studies have yielded promising results for LCLs as a proxy for genetic variants for treatment outcome for a number of cancers as well as toxicity in varying tissue types including taxane-induced neuropathy. Although LCLs have demonstrated utility in the elucidation of functional mechanisms for results of clinical genotype-drug phenotype studies, there are more relevant cell-based models developing.	286	292	TISSUE	tissue
Salvianolic acids for injection (SAI) is developed from traditional Chinese medicine and approved for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, which is often prescribed for patients in combination with SAI. This present study aimed to assess the effects of SAI on the pharmacogenomics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel, thereby ensuring the safety and efficacy of coadministration. In vitro cytochrome P450 isoenzyme assays were performed in human liver microsomes using LC-MS/MS method to assess the metabolites of CYPs substrates. The effects of SAI on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviors of clopidogrel were investigated in rats. The main pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, and inhibition of platelet aggregation were measured to evaluate the effects of pharmacodynamics. Our study revealed that the clinical dose of SAI has no significant inhibitory effect on clopidogrel-related liver microsome metabolic CYP450 isoenzymes. Moreover, SAI did not affect the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel when rats were administered both single and multiple doses. In pharmacodynamic study, SAI has no effect on platelet aggregation rate, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time of clopidogrel but could significantly prevent the risk of bleeding caused by clopidogrel.	1087	1102	TISSUE	liver microsome
One of the most challenging problems in the development of new anticancer drugs is the very high attrition rate. The so-called "drug repositioning process" propose to find new therapeutic indications to already approved drugs. For this, new analytic methods are required to optimize the information present in large-scale pharmacogenomics datasets. We analyzed data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia studies. We focused on common cell lines (n = 471), considering the molecular information, and the drug sensitivity for common drugs screened (n = 15). We propose a novel classification based on transcriptomic profiles of cell lines, according to a biological network-driven gene selection process. Our robust molecular classification displays greater homogeneity of drug sensitivity than cancer cell line grouped based on tissue of origin. We then identified significant associations between cell line cluster and drug response robustly found between both datasets. We further demonstrate the relevance of our method using two additional external datasets and distinct sensitivity metrics. Some associations were still found robust, despite cell lines and drug responses' variations. This study defines a robust molecular classification of cancer cell lines that could be used to find new therapeutic indications to known compounds.	871	877	TISSUE	tissue
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe chronic disorder that represents one of the main causes of disability among young people. To date, no reliable biomarkers are available to inform the diagnosis of BD or clinical response to pharmacological treatment. Studies focused on coding and noncoding transcripts may provide information complementary to genome-wide association studies, allowing to correlate the dynamic evolution of different types of RNAs based on specific cell types and developmental stage with disease development or clinical course. In this narrative review, we summarize findings from human studies that evaluated the potential utility of messenger RNAs and noncoding transcripts, such as microRNAs, circular RNAs and long noncoding RNAs, as peripheral markers of BD and/or response to lithium and other mood stabilizers. The majority of available studies investigated specific targets or pathways, with large heterogeneity in the included type of cells or biofluids. However, a growing number of studies are using hypothesis-free designs, with some studies also integrating data on coding and noncoding RNAs measured in the same participants. Finally, studies conducted in neurons derived from induced-pluripotent stem cells or in brain organoids provide promising preliminary findings supporting the power and utility of these cellular models to investigate the molecular determinants of BD and clinical response.	756	766	TISSUE	peripheral
Warfarin-induced bleeding complications and high inter-patient variability are major hindrances to oral anticoagulant therapy. The present study identifies the influence of VKORC1 diplotypes, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 variants on warfarin disposition and dose requirements in Chinese patients (n=107). The study subjects were genotyped for VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 polymorphic variants. Weekly warfarin dose requirements and S-warfarin clearance were stratified by VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 pharmacogenetics. The major VKORC1 diplotypes were H1-H1 (62%), H1-H7 (18%) and H1-H(*)(b) (10%). Warfarin dose requirements were significantly lower in patients with VKORC1 H1-H1 and H1-H(*)(a) diplotypes compared to patients harboring the H1-H7 and H1-H(*)(b) diplotypes (P<0.05). Hepatic tissues with H1-H1 diplotype had significantly lower expression of VKORC1 mRNA compared with liver tissues carrying the H1-H7 and H1-H(*)(b) diplotypes (P=0.006). The percent variability explained by VKORC1 diplotype status was 59.1% while the CYP2C9 genotype status accounted for 6.9% variability in warfarin dose requirements. Patient age and weight were significant covariates accounting for 29% and 8.6% of warfarin dose variability, respectively. The present study shows that VKORC1 diplotype status, CYP2C9 genotype, age and weight are significant covariates, accounting for 73.4% of interindividual variability in warfarin dose requirements among Chinese patients. Translation of these findings into clinical guidelines for warfarin dosing may be required to assess its impact on the safety and efficacy of warfarin.	770	785	TISSUE	Hepatic tissues

Estrogen hormones play critical roles in the regulation of many tissue functions. The effects of estrogens are primarily mediated by the estrogen receptors (ER) alpha and beta. ERs are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate a complex array of genomic events that orchestrate cellular growth, differentiation and death. Although many factors contribute to their etiology, estrogens are thought to be the primary agents for the development and/or progression of target tissue malignancies. Many of the current modalities for the treatment of estrogen target tissue malignancies are based on agents with diverse pharmacology that alter or prevent ER functions by acting as estrogen competitors. Although these compounds have been successfully used in clinical settings, the efficacy of treatment shows variability. An increasing body of evidence implicates ERalpha polymorphisms as one of the contributory factors for differential responses to estrogen competitors. This review aims to highlight the recent findings on polymorphisms of the lately identified ERbeta in order to provide a functional perspective with potential pharmacogenomic implications.	64	70	TISSUE	tissue
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are important contributors to interindividual differences in drug metabolism leading to adverse drug reactions. Despite their extensive characterization and importance in pharmacogenetics of clinical drugs, the structural basis of CYP polymorphisms has remained scant. Here we report the crystal structures of human CYP2C9 and its polymorphic variants, *3 (I359L) and *30 (A477T), with an antihypertensive drug losartan. The structures show distinct interaction and occupation of losartan in the active site, the access channel, and the peripheral binding site. The I359L substitution located far from the active site remarkably altered the residue side chains near the active site and the access channel, whereas the T477 substitution illustrated hydrogen-bonding interaction with the reoriented side chain of Q214. The results yield structural insights into the reduced catalytic activity of the CYP2C9 variants and have important implications for understanding genetic polymorphisms in CYP-mediated drug metabolism.	620	630	TISSUE	peripheral
In pediatric age and particularly in newborn infants the drug efficacy and safety are influenced by the growth and development on drug Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME). Thanks to the fast development of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics, the drug therapy promises to be adapted to the genetic profile of the individual, reducing considerably the side effects of drugs and increasing their efficacy. Interindividual variability in drug response is well known in both adults and children. Such a variability is multifactorial considering both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Drug distribution in the neonate is influenced by a variety of age-dependent factors as a total body water content and distribution variations, role of drug transporters, blood/tissue protein binding, blood and tissue pH and perfusion. The development of enzymes involved in human metabolism were classified in 3 categories: 1) those expressed during the whole or part of the fetal period, but silenced or expressed at low levels within 1-2 years after birth; 2) those expressed at relatively constant levels throughout fetal development, but increased to some extent postnatally; and 3) those whose onset of expression can occur in the third trimester, but substantial increase is noted in the first 1-2 years after birth. Besides this intrinsic aspects influencing pharmacokinetics during the neonatal period there are other important events such as inborn or acquired diseases, environment and finally pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Thousands of deaths every years are caused by fatal drug reactions; among the potential causes there are not only the severity of the disease being treated, drug interactions, nutritional status, renal and liver functions, but also the inherited differences in drug metabolism and genetic polymorphism. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among pediatric patients have been shown to be three times more frequent than in adults. On August 2010 The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) addressed patient safety issues in the NICU, recognizing that to understand and prevent adverse events, systematic research and education in safety issues needed. From all these concepts in terms of ADME, pharmacogenetics (relative to a single gene) and pharmacogenomics (relative to many genes) it is becoming more evident the perspective of the new concept of individualized medicine. The goal of this should be to identify which group of patients responds positively, which patients are nonresponders and who experiences adverse reaction for the same drug and dose. The interindividual variability in response to any drug is mostly dependent on DNA sequence variations across the human genome, the haplotype map (HAPMAP). At present there is still a big distance beween the knowledge in genetic and the practical application to model the drug profile to the genetic/genomic profile of the single patient. In the neonatal period the effects of growth in the pharmacodynamic, processes can help optimizing the dosage of neonatal frequently used medicines, thereby, minimizing their toxicity and increasing their efficacy. It should be useful to create accurate dosage adjustments according to the week of development.	814	820	TISSUE	tissue
Chronic calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-induced nephrotoxicity is associated with prolonged use of cyclosporine and tacrolimus and has been observed after all types of transplantation, as well as during treatment of autoimmune disease. Extensive alterations in the renal architecture including glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis may lead to end-stage renal failure. Increasing evidence shows that pharmacogenetic factors explain part of the between-patient differences in susceptibility to developing CNI-induced nephrotoxicity. In this paper this evidence is reviewed, with special emphasis on the role of genetic factors influencing metabolism and transportation of CNIs in both acceptor and donor.	290	300	TISSUE	glomerular
Inter-individual variation in drug response and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are well known in medicine. This individual variation in drug response could be at least, in part, due to genetic diversity among individuals. Although substantial studies that connect genetic variants to inter-individual variation in drug response have been documented in several diseases such as cancer and heart diseases, such studies are slowly progressing in ophthalmology. In recent years, advancement in technologies has led to the identification of genes associated with several eye disorders. At the same time, some small-scale studies have demonstrated the association of various genotypes or haplotypes with response to drug therapies. However, its integration into clinical practice in ophthalmology is not possible at present. This is because there are many challenging questions that remain to be addressed. For instance, in the case of complex disorders a single gene study is not enough. Multiple genes, environmental factors, multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and rare or low frequency variants may contribute to the disease and they must be considered. The functional aspects of many genetic variants are not known. This raises questions of their biological importance and their clinical usefulness. In addition, there are legal, ethical, and social issues that need to be regulated. Moreover, physicians and patients must be educated about the limitation and sensitivity of genetic testing. At present pharmacogenetic studies in ophthalmology are still in their infancy and do not suggest that a pharmacogenetic basis of drug development in ophthalmology is a concept that can yield immediate results, but can become a reality in the future. In this article an attempt has been made to summarize some of the recent small-scale pharmacogenetic studies on two major eye disorders, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.	1903	1910	TISSUE	macular
Migraine is a multidimensional disease affecting a large portion of the human population presenting with a variety of symptoms. In the era of personalized medicine, successful migraine treatment presents a challenge, as several studies have shown the impact of a patient's genetic profile on therapy response. However, with the emergence of contemporary treatment options, there is promise for improved outcomes. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus, in order to obtain studies investigating the impact of genetic factors on migraine therapy outcome. Overall, 23 studies were included in the current review, exhibiting diversity in the treatments used and the genetic variants investigated. Divergent genes were assessed for each category of migraine treatment. Several genetic factors were identified to contribute to the heterogeneous response to treatment. SNPs related to pharmacodynamic receptors, pharmacogenetics and migraine susceptibility loci were the most investigated variants, revealing some interesting significant results. To date, various associations have been recorded correlating the impact of genetic factors on migraine treatment responses. More extensive research needs to take place with the aim of shedding light on the labyrinthine effects of genetic variations on migraine treatment, and, consequently, these findings can promptly affect migraine treatment and improve migraine patients' life quality in the vision of precise medicine.	1262	1274	TISSUE	labyrinthine
We summarize and discuss the studies presented at the congress of the American Association of Gastroenterology (Digestive Disease Week) that, in our opinion, are of greatest interest. Both clinically and physiopathologically, functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are highly complex. A single cause is unlikely to explain symptoms as heterogeneous as those of functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, it is easier (and more useful) to try to understand functional GI disorders using a bio-psycho-social model. Moreover, data supporting the combined importance of genetic, organic and psychological factors in the onset and persistence of functional GI disorders are increasingly convincing. This year, new data have been provided on pharmacogenetics in gastroparesis, on microinflammation or alterations in the modulation of somatic and visceral sensitivity in functional dyspepsia, and on the impact of psychological factors in IBS. From the therapeutic point of view, further information has been provided on the role of probiotics, the antinociceptive effect of linaclotide (demonstrated in several studies presented this year), and on the high efficacy of hypnotherapy in patients with IBS. Finally, data on the clinical management of patients with constipation due to pelvic floor dyssynergia and on the safety and efficacy of prucalopride in patients with severe constipation were also of interest.	869	877	TISSUE	visceral

Dichloroacetate (DCA) has several therapeutic applications based on its pharmacological property of inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. DCA has been used to treat inherited mitochondrial disorders that result in lactic acidosis, as well as pulmonary hypertension and several different solid tumors, the latter through its ability to reverse the Warburg effect in cancer cells and restore aerobic glycolysis. The main clinically limiting toxicity is reversible peripheral neuropathy. Although administration of high doses to rodents can result in liver cancer, there is no evidence that DCA is a human carcinogen. In all studied species, including humans, DCA has the interesting property of inhibiting its own metabolism upon repeat dosing, resulting in alteration of its pharmacokinetics. The first step in DCA metabolism is conversion to glyoxylate catalyzed by glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1), for which DCA is a mechanism-based inactivator. The rate of GSTZ1 inactivation by DCA is influenced by age, GSTZ1 haplotype and cellular concentrations of chloride. The effect of DCA on its own metabolism complicates the selection of an effective dose with minimal side effects.	466	476	TISSUE	peripheral

TNF-α inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy both as monotherapy and in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the treatment of chronic inflammatory immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis (Ps) and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and may be administered off-label to treat disseminated granuloma annulare, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. There are several TNF-α inhibitors available for clinical use including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept. In this article, we discuss the efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of spondyloarthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Etanercept is effective in the treatment of PsA, AS, JIA and uveitis. Independent predictors of achieving a sustained clinical improvement or MDA in children with JIA include shorter disease duration, no concurrent oral corticosteroid use, history of chronic anterior uveitis and age <9 years. IBD incidence was lower in patients receiving etanercept plus MTX. Intra-articular administration of etanercept seems to favor a prompt target joint improvement without serious adverse events. Etanercept improve endothelial function reducing the risk of acute cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events. The most commonly reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, epidermal and dermal conditions, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, headache and fatigue.	1021	1029	TISSUE	anterior

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of multiple peripheral joints, which leads to serious destruction of cartilage and bone, progressive deformity and severe disability. Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the first-line drugs commonly used in RA therapy owing to its excellent long-term efficacy and cheapness. However, the efficacy and toxicity of MTX treatment have significant interpatient variability. Genetic factors contribute to this variability. In this review, we have summarized and updated the progress of RA response to MTX treatment since 2009 by focusing on the fields of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Identification of genetic factors involved in MTX treatment response will increase the understanding of RA pathology and the development of new personalized treatments.	175	184	TISSUE	cartilage

Studies in hypertension (HTN) pharmacogenomics seek to identify genetic sources of variable antihypertensive drug response. Genetic association studies have detected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that link to drug responses; however, to understand mechanisms underlying how genetic traits alter drug responses, a biological interface is needed. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potential source for studying otherwise inaccessible tissues that may be important to antihypertensive drug response. The present study established multiple iPSC lines from an HTN pharmacogenomics cohort. We demonstrated that established HTN iPSCs can robustly and reproducibly differentiate into functional vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), a cell type most relevant to vasculature tone control. Moreover, a sensitive traction force microscopy assay demonstrated that iPSC-derived VSMCs show a quantitative contractile response on physiological stimulus of endothelin-1. Furthermore, the inflammatory chemokine tumor necrosis factor α induced a typical VSMC response in iPSC-derived VSMCs. These studies pave the way for a large research initiative to decode biological significance of identified SNPs in hypertension pharmacogenomics.	472	479	TISSUE	tissues
The impact of drug transporters on drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics has been increasingly recognized in recent years. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the ABCB1 (formerly MDR1) gene, is among the most well-characterized drug transporters, particularly in veterinary medicine. P-gp is expressed by a variety of normal tissues, including the intestines, brain capillary endothelial cells, renal tubular cells, and biliary canalicular cells, where it functions to actively extrude substrate drugs. In this capacity, P-gp limits oral absorption and central nervous system entry of many substrate drugs and enhances their excretion from the body. Many drugs used in veterinary medicine are substrates for P-gp, including many chemotherapeutic agents and macrocyclic lactones (avermectins and milbemycin). A 4-base pair deletion mutation in the ABCB1 gene occurs in many herding breed dogs, including collies, Australian shepherds, and Shetland sheepdogs. The mutation (ABCB1-1Delta) renders affected animals extremely susceptible to toxicosis induced by substrate drugs, such as the macrocyclic lactones at doses well below those tolerated by dogs with the wild-type ABCB1 gene. However, at the manufacturer's recommended dose, all FDA-approved heartworm preventive products marketed in the United States are safe, even for dogs with the ABCB1 mutant/mutant genotype.	332	339	TISSUE	tissues
Pain is an unpleasant feeling usually resulting from tissue damage that can persist along weeks, months, or even years after the injury, turning into pathological chronic pain, the leading cause of disability. Currently, pharmacology interventions are usually the first-line therapy but there is a highly variable analgesic drug response. Pharmacogenetics (PGx) offers a means to identify genetic biomarkers that can predict individual analgesic response opening doors to precision medicine. PGx analyze the way in which the presence of variations in the DNA sequence (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) could be responsible for portions of the population reaching different levels of pain relief (phenotype) due to gene interference in the drug mechanism of action (pharmacodynamics) and/or its concentration at the place of action (pharmacokinetics). SNPs in the cytochrome P450 enzymes genes (CYP2D6) influence metabolism of codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and tricyclic antidepressants. Blood concentrations of some NSAIDs depend on CYP2C9 and/or CYP2C8 activity. Additional candidate genes encode for opioid receptors, transporters, and other molecules important for pharmacotherapy in pain management. However, PGx studies are often contradictory, slowing the uptake of this information. This is likely due, in large part, to a lack of robust evidence demonstrating clinical utility and to its polygenic response modulated by other exogenous or epigenetics factors. Novel therapies, including targeting of epigenetic changes and gene therapy-based approaches, broaden future options to improve understanding of pain and the treatment of people who suffer it.	53	59	TISSUE	tissue

Astrocytes are ubiquitous in the brain and are widely held to be largely identical. However, this view has not been fully tested, and the possibility that astrocytes are neural circuit specialized remains largely unexplored. Here, we used multiple integrated approaches, including RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), mass spectrometry, electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, serial block-face-scanning electron microscopy, morphological reconstructions, pharmacogenetics, and diffusible dye, calcium, and glutamate imaging, to directly compare adult striatal and hippocampal astrocytes under identical conditions. We found significant differences in electrophysiological properties, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, morphology, and astrocyte-synapse proximity between striatal and hippocampal astrocytes. Unbiased evaluation of actively translated RNA and proteomic data confirmed significant astrocyte diversity between hippocampal and striatal circuits. We thus report core astrocyte properties, reveal evidence for specialized astrocytes within neural circuits, and provide new, integrated database resources and approaches to explore astrocyte diversity and function throughout the adult brain.

<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To examine whether serotonin (5-HT) related genetic variants moderate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) at the radius, lumbar spine (LS) BMD, total body less head (TBLH) bone mineral content (BMC) and markers of bone metabolism (osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX-1], and bone specific alkaline phosphatase to CTX-1 ratio) were examined in an observational study, enrolling 15- to 20-year-old participants, unmedicated or within a month of SSRI initiation. Variants in <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295), <i>HTR1B</i> (rs6296), <i>HTR1D</i> (rs6300), <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311 and rs6314), <i>HTR2B</i> (rs6736017), and the serotonin transporter intron 2 variable number tandem repeat (STin2 VNTR) were genotyped. Linear mixed-effects regression analysis examined associations between SSRI use, genetic variants, and skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> After adjusting for relevant covariates, rs6295 CC and GC genotypes in 262 participants (60% female, mean ± SD age = 18.9 ± 1.6 years) were significantly associated with higher LS BMD compared to the GG genotype. Rs6311 GG SSRI users had greater LS BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.18, <i>p</i> = <0.0001). Female SSRI users with the combination of rs6295 CC+GC and rs6311 GG genotypes had greater LS BMD than female SSRI nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.29, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). SSRI users with the rs6295 GG genotype had higher trabecular BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 3.60, <i>p</i> = 0.05). No significant interactions were found for TBLH BMC or bone turnover markers. After correcting for multiple comparisons, none of the results retained significance. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> In older adolescents and young adults, <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295) and <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311) variants may moderate the effect of SSRIs on BMD. Sex differences may exist and require further examination. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm our preliminary findings. <b><i>Clinical Trial Registration:</i></b> clinicaltrials.gov NCT02147184.	1407	1409	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	LS
CYP2C19 is one of the principal enzymes involved in the bioactivation of the antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel. A common loss-of-function allele, <i>CYP2C19*2</i> (c.681G>A; rs4244285), is associated with increased risk for serious adverse cardiovascular events in both heterozygous and homozygous patients (~25–50% of the population) with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) who are receiving clopidogrel, particularly among those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We provide evidence from published literature and guidelines for <i>CYPC19</i> genotype–directed antiplatelet therapy (periodically updated at http://www.pharmgkb.org).	77	89	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	antiplatelet

Metoprolol is a medication commonly utilized in select patients to achieve a reduction in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, or other indications. A majority of metoprolol metabolism occurs via <i>CYP2D6</i>. Decreased expression of the CYP2D6 enzyme increases the concentration of metoprolol. Current pharmacogenomics guidelines by the Dutch Pharmacogenomics Working Group recommend slower titrations and dose decreases to minimize adverse effects from poor metabolizers or normal metabolizers taking concomitant medications that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (phenoconverters). This study aimed to evaluate adverse effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope in patients who are expected to have absent CYP2D6 enzyme activity due to drug-drug or drug-gene interactions. The secondary aims of this study were to evaluate heart rate measurements for the included participants. Retrospective data were collected for individuals with <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping results obtained for clinical purposes. Three categories (CYP2D6 normal metabolizers, poor metabolizers, and phenoconverters) were assigned. A total of 325 participants were included. There was no statistically significant difference found in the primary composite outcome between the three metabolizer groups (<i>p</i> = 0.054). However, a statistically significant difference was identified in the incidences of bradycardia between the poor metabolizers and the normal metabolizers or phenoconverters (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The average heart rates were 2.8 beats per minute (bpm) and 2.6 bpm lower for the poor metabolizer and phenoconverter groups, respectively, compared to the normal metabolizers (<i>p</i> < 0.0001 for both comparisons). This study further supports the role of genetic testing in precision medicine to help individualize patient care as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking metoprolol were found to have an increase in bradycardia. Additional research is needed to clarify the dose relationship in this drug-gene interaction.	102	116	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	systolic blood
Sensory systems sequentially extract increasingly complex features. ON and OFF pathways, for example, encode increases or decreases of a stimulus from a common input. This ON/OFF pathway split is thought to occur at individual synaptic connections through a sign-inverting synapse in one of the pathways. Here, we show that ON selectivity is a multisynaptic process in the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system. A pharmacogenetics approach demonstrates that both glutamatergic inhibition through GluClα and GABAergic inhibition through Rdl mediate ON responses. Although neurons postsynaptic to the glutamatergic ON pathway input L1 lose all responses in <i>GluClα</i> mutants, they are resistant to a cell-type-specific loss of <i>GluClα</i>. This shows that ON selectivity is distributed across multiple synapses, and raises the possibility that cell-type-specific manipulations might reveal similar strategies in other sensory systems. Thus, sensory coding is more distributed than predicted by simple circuit motifs, allowing for robust neural processing.	1035	1041	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	neural
Fear behavior is under tight control of the prefrontal cortex, but the underlying microcircuit mechanism remains elusive. In particular, it is unclear how distinct subtypes of inhibitory interneurons (INs) within prefrontal cortex interact and contribute to fear expression. We employed a social fear conditioning paradigm and induced robust social fear in mice. We found that social fear is characterized by activation of dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and is largely diminished by dmPFC inactivation. With a combination of in vivo electrophysiological recordings and fiber photometry together with cell-type-specific pharmacogenetics, we further demonstrated that somatostatin (SST) INs suppressed parvalbumin (PV) INs and disinhibited pyramidal cells and consequently enhanced dmPFC output to mediate social fear responses. These results reveal a previously unknown disinhibitory microcircuit in prefrontal cortex through interactions between IN subtypes and suggest that SST INs-mediated disinhibition represents an important circuit mechanism in gating social fear behavior.	423	436	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	dorsal medial
<b>Aim:</b> To explore the effect of <i>CYP2D6*10</i> (100C > T) and <i>ADRB1</i> 1165 G > C polymorphisms on heart rate of post-PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) patients treated with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 756 inpatients with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets were selected and the genotypes of <i>CYP2D6*10</i> and <i>ADRB1</i> 1165G > C were detected in 319 patients using gene chip detection. The target heart rate was defined as a resting heart rate < 70 beats/min. Clinical data were collected. <b>Results:</b> A total of 319 inpatients were enrolled in the study. The mutant allele frequencies of <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>ADRB1</i> were 57.21 and 69.44%, respectively. Whatever the dose of metoprolol, the heart rates were lower in patients with homozygous mutation of <i>CYP2D6</i> than those with heterozygous mutation and wild-type (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, this effect was not seen between different genotypes of <i>ADRB1</i>. Logistic regression analysis showed that the dose of metoprolol and the genotypes of <i>CYP2D6</i> were predictors of heart rate <70 beats/min in these patients. Further multivariate analysis indicated that patients with homozygous mutation had better control of heart rates compared with those with wild-type and heterozygous mutation of <i>CYP2D6*10</i> genotypes (all: p < 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b><i>CYP2D6*10</i> polymorphisms were associated with the heart rate of post-PCI patients treated with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets.	147	155	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary
Rilpivirine (RPV), the latest nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor active against HIV-1, is prescribed in a standard dosage of 25 mg once a day in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The aim of this observational study was to characterize the RPV pharmacokinetic profile, to quantify interpatient variability, and to identify potential factors that could influence drug exposure. RPV concentration data were collected from HIV-infected patients as part of routine therapeutic drug monitoring performed in our center (Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology). A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with NONMEM by comparing various structural models. The influence of demographic and clinical covariates, as well as frequent genetic polymorphisms in 5 genes (CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*17, UGT1A1*28, and UGT1A4*2), on RPV elimination was explored. A total of 325 plasma concentration measurements were obtained from 249 HIV-positive patients. Plasma concentrations ranged from 12 to 255 ng/ml. A one-compartment model with zero-order absorption best characterized RPV pharmacokinetics. The average RPV clearance (CL) was 11.7 liters/h, the average volume of distribution was 401 liters, and the mean absorption time was 4 h. The interinterindividual variability (IIV) for CL was estimated to be 33%. None of the available demographic or genetic covariates showed any influence on RPV pharmacokinetics, but 29% of the patients were predicted to present minimal concentrations below the recently identified target cutoff value of 50 ng/ml. The variability in RPV pharmacokinetics appears to be lower than that for most other antiretroviral drugs. However, under the standard regimen of 25 mg daily, a significant number of patients might be underdosed. It remains to be investigated whether the underexposure has an impact on the development of resistance while patients are on maintenance therapy.	1186	1188	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	CL

Behçet disease (BD) is an enigmatic inflammatory disorder with multisystemic complications which is endemic in some countries but can be seen in the entire world. Valid diagnostic criteria are available. The pathology is related to a specific perivasculitis with involvement of both arteries and veins of all sizes. Minor arterial and cardiac involvement is frequent in BD but is usually asymptomatic. In exceptional cases cardiac symptoms may be the 1st manifestation of BD. The prevalence of severe cardiac complications (cardio-Behçet) should be < 10%. An impressive therapeutic improvement has been achieved by using appropriate catheterization techniques, coronary and intra-arterial stents, colchicine, drug-response modifying drugs and immunotherapy but, still cardio-Behçet has a poor prognosis. Efforts are undertaken to improve morbidity and prognosis with the use of newer drugs. An important part of the complications in BD are related to the frequent thromboembolic complications and there is high possibility that newer oral anticoagulants will be superior to the classical anticoagulants presently used. Available biologic agents have already been frequently used and seem to have improved the prognosis, but efforts are undertaken to find newer biologic agents with better therapeutic performance and less side-effects. Summarizing as much as possible the effects of the presently used biotherapy in BD, interferon-alpha is effective against many ocular, genital and perhaps vascular manifestations, but its effectiveness is limited by frequent adverse-effects (even if not dangerous for the cardiovascular system). Infliximab is a valid option in the therapy of ocular and cutaneous manifestations but it is less convincing in the therapy of vascular manifestations in vascular- and neuro-Behçet; furthermore, side-effects, including severe cardiovascular complications, are seen in a minority of patients; perhaps worse, infliximab seems to loose efficacy in the long-term therapy, while pharmacogenetics and receptor polymorphism may explain the existence of non-responders and the occurrence of resistance. Adalimumab might be a promising alternative for infliximab and seems to exert a good effect in an eurysmatic and other vascular complications. However, we lack long-term studies. Other biologic agents have been used only in few cases and it is too early to say if they offer new therapeutic perspectives.	283	291	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	arteries

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Essential hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of other cardiovascular diseases and is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors, with up to 50% of blood pressure variance currently attributed to an individual's genetic makeup. By studying genes that cause monogenic forms of hypertension and pathways relevant to blood pressure control, a number of polymorphisms have been identified that increase an individual's risk of developing high blood pressure. We report on candidate gene association studies and genome-wide association studies that have been performed to date in the field of hypertension research. It is becoming clear that for the majority of people there is no single gene polymorphism that causes hypertension, but rather a number of common genetic variants, each having a small effect. Using pharmacogenomics to personalize the treatment of hypertension holds promise for achieving and sustaining normotensive pressures quickly, while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions and unwanted side-effects. This will decrease the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in individuals and lead to a reduced burden of disease upon society as a whole.	1166	1176	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	myocardial
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing is commonly utilized to predict a patient's response to medications based on the presence of genetic variants. However, certain conditions have been associated with potentially inaccurate PGx results. The majority of medications are predominantly metabolized in the liver; therefore, in the case of liver transplantation, PGx results may be misinterpreted in the context of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Other instances of ambiguous PGx results have been reported in the literature in conditions such as allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute or chronic myeloid leukemia and blood transfusion. In order to prevent potential inaccuracies in PGx testing, Sanford Imagenetics developed an active, interruptive alert to inform providers of the potential for inaccurate PGx results.	556	567	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	bone marrow

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is genetic autosomal recessive disease caused by reduced or absent function of CFTR protein. Treatments for patients with CF have primarily focused on the downstream end-organ consequences of defective CFTR. Since the discovery of the CFTR gene that causes CF in 1989 there have been tremendous advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of CF. This has recently led to the development of new CFTR mutation-specific targeted therapies for select patients with CF. This review will discuss the characteristics of the CFTR gene, the CFTR mutations that cause CF and the new mutation specific pharmacological treatments including gene therapy that are contributing to the dawning of a new era in cystic fibrosis care.	143	145	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	CF
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective controller medications for asthma, and variability in ICS response is associated with genetic variation. Despite ICS treatment, some patients with poor asthma control experience severe asthma exacerbations, defined as a hospitalization or emergency room visit. We hypothesized that some individuals may be at increased risk of asthma exacerbations, despite ICS use, due to genetic factors. A GWAS of 237,726 common, independent markers was conducted in 806 Caucasian asthmatic patients from two population-based biobanks: BioVU, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) in Tennessee (369 patients), and Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP) at the Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin (437 patients). Using a case-control study design, the association of each SNP locus with the outcome of asthma exacerbations (defined as asthma-related emergency department visits or hospitalizations concurrent with oral corticosteroid use), was evaluated for each population by logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age, gender and the first four principal components. A meta-analysis of the results was conducted. Validation of expression of selected candidate genes was determined by evaluating an independent microarray expression data set. Our study identified six novel SNPs associated with differential risk of asthma exacerbations (P < 10(-05)). The top GWAS result, rs2395672 in CMTR1, was associated with an increased risk of exacerbations in both populations (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11; joint P = 2.3 × 10(-06)). Two SNPs (rs2395672 and rs279728) were associated with increased risk of exacerbations, while the remaining four SNPs (rs4271056, rs6467778, rs2691529, and rs9303988) were associated with decreased risk. Three SNPs (rs2395672, rs6467778, and rs2691529) were present in three genes: CMTR1, TRIM24 and MAGI2. The CMTR1 mRNA transcript was significantly differentially expressed in nasal lavage samples from asthmatics during acute exacerbations, suggesting potential involvement of this gene in the development of this phenotype. We show that genetic variability may contribute to asthma exacerbations in patients taking ICS. Furthermore, our studies implicate CMTR1 as a novel candidate gene with potential roles in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations.	1553	1558	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a silent progressive polygenic metabolic disorder resulting from ineffective insulin cascading in the body. World-wide, about 415 million people are suffering from T2DM with a projected rise to 642 million in 2040. T2DM is treated with several classes of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) viz. biguanides, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, etc. Treatment strategies for T2DM are to minimize long-term micro and macro vascular complications by achieving an optimized glycemic control. Genetic variations in the human genome not only disclose the risk of T2DM development but also predict the personalized response to drug therapy. Inter-individual variability in response to OADs is due to polymorphisms in genes encoding drug receptors, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes for example, genetic variants in solute carrier transporters (SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A3, SLC47A1 and SLC47A2) are actively involved in glycemic/HbA1c management of metformin. In addition, CYP gene encoding Cytochrome P450 enzymes also play a crucial role with respect to metabolism of drugs. Pharmacogenetic studies provide insights on the relationship between individual genetic variants and variable therapeutic outcomes of various OADs. Clinical utility of pharmacogenetic study is to predict the therapeutic dose of various OADs on individual basis. Pharmacogenetics therefore, is a step towards personalized medicine which will greatly improve the efficacy of diabetes treatment.	464	472	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	vascular
Pharmacotherapeutic options for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have increased dramatically in the last two decades and along with this have been substantial improvements in survival. Despite these advances, however, PAH remains a progressive and ultimately fatal disease for most patients and only epoprostenol has been shown to improve survival in a randomized control trial. Clinical observations of the heterogeneity of treatment response to different classes of medications across the phenotypically diverse PAH population has led to the identification of patients who derive significantly more benefit from certain medications than the population mean, the so-called "super responders." This was first recognized among PAH patients with acute vasodilator response during invasive hemodynamic testing, a subset of whom have dramatically improved survival when treated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy. Retrospective studies have now suggested a sex discrepancy in response to endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and more recently a few studies have found genomic associations with response to CCBs and ERAs. With increasing availability of "omics" technologies, recognition of these "super responders," combined with careful clinical and molecular phenotyping, will lead to advances in pharmacogenomics, precision medicine, and continued improvements in survival among PAH patients.	32	50	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	pulmonary arterial
Cyclophosphamide remains a critical component to haploidentical transplant conditioning regimens. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) emerged as an effective component of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in the nonmyeloablative haploidentical bone marrow transplant setting. The relative ease of administration compared with ex vivo manipulations and efficacy in reducing GVHD has led to increasing PTCy use in transplant centers around the world. The role of PTCy has expanded to haploidentical transplantation with myeloablative conditioning regimens and peripheral blood progenitor cells as the donor source. Moreover, encouraging results in GVHD management have been shown with the use of PTCy alone or in combination with other immunosuppressives in the human leukocyte antigen-matched donor setting. The toxicity profile of cyclophosphamide varies extensively depending on dose, duration, overall drug exposure, and, potentially, pharmacogenetics. This review highlights the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxic effects of cyclophosphamide and offers practical guidance for clinical application in the post-transplant setting. We summarize data on the management of high-dose cyclophosphamide toxicities and provide insights into the pharmacogenetic implications on drug efficacy and safety data.	256	267	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	bone marrow
Pharmacogenomics has been implicated in the response variability of antiplatelet drugs in coronary artery disease (CAD), particularly for aspirin and clopidogrel. A large number of studies and several meta-analyses have been published on this topic, but until recently, there have been no clear conclusions and no definite guidelines on the clinical use of pharmacogenetic testing before prescribing antiplatelet drugs for CAD. In this review, the available evidence is summarized. The most consistent results are on clopidogrel, where CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles are associated with stent thrombosis events. We recommend to genotype for CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles in patients with CAD who are to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting, and to adjust the antiplatelet treatment based on the genotyping results.	90	105	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary artery

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its complications such as diabetic macular edema continue to remain a major cause for legal blindness in the developed world. While the introduction of anti-tVEGF agents has significantly improved visual outcomes of patients with DR, unpredictable response, largely due to genetic polymorphisms, appears to be a challenge with this therapy. With advances in identification of various genetic biomarkers, novel therapeutic strategies consisting of gene transfer are being developed and tested for patients with DR. Application of pharmacogenetic principles appears to be a promising futuristic strategy to attenuate diabetes-mediated retinal vasculopathy. In this comprehensive review, data from recent studies in the field of pharmacogenomics for the treatment of DR have been provided.	663	670	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	retinal
Predicting risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) is an evidence-based practice that incorporates lifestyle, history, and other risk factors. Statins reduce risk for MACE by decreasing lipids, but it is difficult to stratify risk following initiation of a statin. Genetic risk determinants for on-statin MACE are low-effect size and impossible to generalize. Our objective was to determine high-level epistatic risk factors for on-statin MACE with GWAS-scale data. Controlled-access data for 5890 subjects taking a statin collected from Vanderbilt University Medical Center's BioVU were obtained from dbGaP. We used Random Forest Iterative Feature Reduction and Selection (RF-IFRS) to select highly informative genetic and environmental features from a GWAS-scale dataset of patients taking statin medications. Variant-pairs were distilled into overlapping networks and assembled into individual decision trees to provide an interpretable set of variants and associated risk. 1718 cases who suffered MACE and 4172 controls were obtained from dbGaP. Pathway analysis showed that variants in genes related to vasculogenesis (FDR = 0.024), angiogenesis (FDR = 0.019), and carotid artery disease (FDR = 0.034) were related to risk for on-statin MACE. We identified six gene-variant networks that predicted odds of on-statin MACE. The most elevated risk was found in a small subset of patients carrying variants in <i>COL4A2</i>, <i>TMEM178B</i>, <i>SZT2</i>, and <i>TBXAS1</i> (OR = 4.53, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The RF-IFRS method is a viable method for interpreting complex "black-box" findings from machine-learning. In this study, it identified epistatic networks that could be applied to risk estimation for on-statin MACE. Further study will seek to replicate these findings in other populations.	1182	1196	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	carotid artery
Age-related macular degeneration is a major cause of blindness among people aged 50 and older in industrialized countries. Anti-VEGF therapy has been tremendously successful in the treatment of neovascular macular degeneration. Examining the pharmacogenetics of patients' response to the anti-VEGF molecules could allow for a tailored treatment strategy based on patients' underlying genetics rather than the "one-size fits all" approach currently used.	194	213	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	neovascular macular
Fibromyalgia (FM) and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) are diseases of unknown etiology presenting complex and often overlapping symptomatology. Despite promising advances on the study of miRNomes of these diseases, no validated molecular diagnostic biomarker yet exists. Since FM and ME/CFS patient treatments commonly include polypharmacy, it is of concern that biomarker miRNAs are masked by drug interactions. Aiming at discriminating between drug-effects and true disease-associated differential miRNA expression, we evaluated the potential impact of commonly prescribed drugs on disease miRNomes, as reported by the literature. By using the web search tools SM2miR, Pharmaco-miR, and repoDB, we found a list of commonly prescribed drugs that impact FM and ME/CFS miRNomes and therefore could be interfering in the process of biomarker discovery. On another end, disease-associated miRNomes may incline a patient's response to treatment and toxicity. Here, we explored treatments for diseases in general that could be affected by FM and ME/CFS miRNomes, finding a long list of them, including treatments for lymphoma, a type of cancer affecting ME/CFS patients at a higher rate than healthy population. We conclude that FM and ME/CFS miRNomes could help refine pharmacogenomic/pharmacoepigenomic analysis to elevate future personalized medicine and precision medicine programs in the clinic.	14	16	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	FM

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) represents a common final pathway leading to heart failure. We have searched for genetic determinants of left ventricular (LV) mass using values for absolute electrocardiographic QRS voltage in a healthy Japanese population. After adjusting for covariates, the corrected S and R wave voltages in leads V1 and V5 from 2,994 healthy volunteers in the Japan Pharmacogenomics Data Science Consortium (JPDSC) database were subjected to a genome-wide association study. Potential associations were validated by an in silico replication study using an independent Japanese population obtained from the Nagahama Prospective Genome Cohort for Comprehensive Human Bioscience. We identified a novel association between the lead V5, R wave voltage in Japanese individuals and SNP rs7301743[G], which maps near the gene encoding T-box transcription factor Tbx3. Meta-analysis of two independent Japanese datasets demonstrated a marginally significant association of SNP rs7301743 in TBX3|MED13L with a 0.071 mV (95% CI, 0.038-0.11 mV) shorter R wave amplitude in the V5 lead per minor allele copy (P = 7.635 x 10(-8)). The transcriptional repressor, TBX3, is proposed to suppress the development of working ventricular myocardium. Our findings suggest that genetic variation of Tbx3 is associated with LV mass in a healthy Japanese population.	0	16	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	Left ventricular

The objective of this prospective study was to examine the exposure to the main active metabolites of ciprofloxacin in critically ill patients and to examine the factors (demographic, laboratory and genetic) that could potentially affect the drug metabolic conversion of ciprofloxacin. The secondary aim was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for the metabolite showing the most associations with the abovementioned factors. A total of 29 patients were treated with intravenous infusion of ciprofloxacin and enrolled on this trial. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken at 1, 4, and 11.5 h following the completion of the infusion. Sex, age, body weight, height, serum creatinine and bilirubin levels, and creatinine clearance (CL<sub>CR</sub>) were recorded, and polymorphisms rs2032582 and rs1045642 in the <i>ABCB1</i> gene, rs4148977 in the <i>SLCO1A2</i> gene and rs762551 in the <i>CYP1A2</i> gene were analyzed. A three-stage parent drug-metabolite population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Median (IQR) metabolite/parent ratios of the desethylene ciprofloxacin, formyl ciprofloxacin and oxociprofloxacin were 5.86 (4.09-9.87)%, 4.08 (3.38-6.92)% and 5.91 (3.42-13.65)%, respectively. The desethylene ciprofloxacin metabolic ratio was positively associated with height (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2277, <i>p</i> = 0.0089) and CL<sub>CR</sub> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2023, <i>p</i> = 0.0144) and negatively associated with age (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2227, <i>p</i> = 0.0112). Males had a significantly higher oxociprofloxacin metabolic ratio than females (9.14 vs 3.42%, <i>p</i> = 0.0043). In the desethylene ciprofloxacin population PK model, the volume of distribution decreased with age, the parent drug-metabolite transfer rate constant increased with CL<sub>CR</sub>, and the metabolite elimination rate constant decreased with age and is increased in <i>CYP1A2</i> rs762551 variant allele carriers. We therefore hypothesized that the CYP1A2 inhibition by ciprofloxacin is mediated by its metabolite desethylene ciprofloxacin.	1357	1359	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	CL

Dementia is an important issue in western societies, and in the following years, this problem will also rise in the developing regions, such as Africa and Asia. The most common types of dementia in adults are Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Vascular Dementia (VaD), of which, AD accounts for more than half of the cases. The most prominent symptom of AD is cognitive impairment, currently treated with four drugs: Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, enhancing cholinergic transmission; as well as memantine, protecting neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity. Despite ongoing efforts, no new drugs in the treatment of AD have been registered for the last ten years, thus multiple studies have been conducted on genetic factors affecting the efficacy of antidementia pharmacotherapy. The researchers investigate the effects of variants in multiple genes, such as ABCB1, ACE, CHAT, CHRNA7, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, NR1I2, NR1I3, POR, PPAR, RXR, SLC22A1/2/5, SLC47A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 and UGT2B7, associated with numerous pathways: the development of pathological proteins, formation and metabolism of acetylcholine, transport, metabolism and excretion of antidementia drugs and transcription factors regulating the expression of genes responsible for metabolism and transport of drugs. The most promising results have been demonstrated for APOE E4, dementia risk variant, BCHE-K, reduced butyrylcholinesterase activity variant, and CYP2D6 UM, ultrarapid hepatic metabolism. Further studies investigate the possibilities of the development of emerging drugs or genetic editing by CRISPR/Cas9 for causative treatment. In conclusion, the pharmacogenetic studies on dementia diseases may improve the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in some patients with beneficial genetic variants, at the same time, identifying the carriers of unfavorable alleles, the potential group of novel approaches to the treatment and prevention of dementia.	302	310	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	Vascular
Salvianolic acids for injection (SAI) is developed from traditional Chinese medicine and approved for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, which is often prescribed for patients in combination with SAI. This present study aimed to assess the effects of SAI on the pharmacogenomics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel, thereby ensuring the safety and efficacy of coadministration. In vitro cytochrome P450 isoenzyme assays were performed in human liver microsomes using LC-MS/MS method to assess the metabolites of CYPs substrates. The effects of SAI on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviors of clopidogrel were investigated in rats. The main pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, and inhibition of platelet aggregation were measured to evaluate the effects of pharmacodynamics. Our study revealed that the clinical dose of SAI has no significant inhibitory effect on clopidogrel-related liver microsome metabolic CYP450 isoenzymes. Moreover, SAI did not affect the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel when rats were administered both single and multiple doses. In pharmacodynamic study, SAI has no effect on platelet aggregation rate, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time of clopidogrel but could significantly prevent the risk of bleeding caused by clopidogrel.	138	153	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	cerebrovascular
Clinical pharmacogenetics, the use of genetic data to guide drug therapy decisions, is beginning to be used for medications commonly prescribed by family physicians. However, clinicians are largely unfamiliar with principles supporting clinical use of this type of data. For example, genetic variability in the cytochrome P450 2D6 drug metabolizing enzyme can alter the clinical effects of some opioid analgesics (e.g., codeine, tramadol), whereas variability in the CYP2C19 enzyme affects the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel. If testing is performed, patients who are ultrarapid or poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 should avoid codeine use (and possibly tramadol, hydrocodone, and oxycodone) because of the potential for increased toxicity or lack of effectiveness. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndromes who are known to be poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 should consider alternate antiplatelet therapy (e.g., ticagrelor, prasugrel). Some guidelines are available that address appropriate drug therapy changes, and others are in development. Additionally, a number of clinical resources are emerging to support family physicians in the use of pharmacogenetics. When used appropriately, pharmacogenetic testing can be a practical tool to optimize drug therapy and avoid medication adverse effects.	794	802	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory arthritis that can not only result in permanent joint damage, but is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the mainstay of treatment in RA. DMARDs improve the symptoms of joint pain and swelling, but more importantly, prevent the progression of joint damage. Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line DMARD in RA with over two decades worth of excellent long-term efficacy and safety. However, there is significant variability in patients' response to MTX, both in efficacy and toxicity. Recent advances in genetics, particularly pharmacogenetics, may permit the prediction, a priori, of an individual patient's response to MTX. In this review, we highlight recent published literature on the pharmacogenetics of MTX in RA. Pharmacogenetics may be a useful means of optimising MTX therapy in patients with RA.	101	106	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint

Chronic calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-induced nephrotoxicity is associated with prolonged use of cyclosporine and tacrolimus and has been observed after all types of transplantation, as well as during treatment of autoimmune disease. Extensive alterations in the renal architecture including glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis may lead to end-stage renal failure. Increasing evidence shows that pharmacogenetic factors explain part of the between-patient differences in susceptibility to developing CNI-induced nephrotoxicity. In this paper this evidence is reviewed, with special emphasis on the role of genetic factors influencing metabolism and transportation of CNIs in both acceptor and donor.	312	319	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	tubular
<b>Background:</b> Clopidogrel is frequently used in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), but its efficacy is hampered by inter-individual variability, due to genetic differences associated with clopidogrel metabolism. We conducted this randomized controlled trial to validate whether the personalized antiplatelet therapy based on clopidogrel pharmacogenomics and clinical characteristics leads to better clinical outcomes compared with standard treatment. <b>Methods:</b> Patients were randomly divided into the standard group or pharmacogenetic group, in which the pharmacogenetic group required the detection of the genotyping of <i>CYP2C19*2</i>, <i>CYP2C19*3</i>, and <i>CYP2C19*17</i>. Patients were followed up for 90 days for the primary efficacy endpoint of new stroke events, secondary efficacy endpoint of individual or composite outcomes of the new clinical vascular events, and the incidence of disability. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. <b>Results:</b> A total of 650 patients underwent randomization, among which 325 were in the pharmacogenomics group while 325 were in the standard group. Our study found after a 90-day follow-up, the risk of stroke and composite vascular events in the pharmacogenomics group was lower than that in the standard group. The incidence of disability significantly decreased in the pharmacogenomics group. In addition, no statistically significant differences were observed in bleeding events between the two groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> The present study demonstrates that personalized antiplatelet therapy guided by clopidogrel pharmacogenomics and clinical characteristics can significantly improve the net clinical benefit of ischemic stroke or TIA patients during the 90-day treatment period without increasing bleeding risk.	900	908	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	vascular

In addition, no statistically significant differences were observed in bleeding events between the two groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> The present study demonstrates that personalized antiplatelet therapy guided by clopidogrel pharmacogenomics and clinical characteristics can significantly improve the net clinical benefit of ischemic stroke or TIA patients during the 90-day treatment period without increasing bleeding risk.	1226	1234	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	vascular
Although current literature indicates both a clinical and a cost-effective benefit of routine genotype-guided treatment of patients treated with clopidogrel, this strategy is not recommended in guidelines. In cardiology, but also in neurology and vascular surgery, the current scientific evidence for this is still insufficient. Nevertheless, the role of pharmacogenetics will gain importance in today's medical world, where the demand for personalised medicine is on the rise. The implementation of genotyping in the clinic will nonetheless be a practical challenge due to a lack of clarity about who will bear the associated costs. In patients with coronary artery disease and a higher bleeding risk, it is valuable to determine the CYP2C19 genotype prior to treatment with clopidogrel. Pending further studies, we recommend that specialists prescribing clopidogrel should determine the CYP2C19 genotype in patients at high risk of recurrent ischemic events.	247	255	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	vascular

CellMinerCDB provides a web-based resource (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb/) for integrating multiple forms of pharmacological and genomic analyses, and unifying the richest cancer cell line datasets (the NCI-60, NCI-SCLC, Sanger/MGH GDSC, and Broad CCLE/CTRP). CellMinerCDB enables data queries for genomics and gene regulatory network analyses, and exploration of pharmacogenomic determinants and drug signatures. It leverages overlaps of cell lines and drugs across databases to examine reproducibility and expand pathway analyses. We illustrate the value of CellMinerCDB for elucidating gene expression determinants, such as DNA methylation and copy number variations, and highlight complexities in assessing mutational burden. We demonstrate the value of CellMinerCDB in selecting drugs with reproducible activity, expand on the dominant role of SLFN11 for drug response, and present novel response determinants and genomic signatures for topoisomerase inhibitors and schweinfurthins. We also introduce LIX1L as a gene associated with mesenchymal signature and regulation of cellular migration and invasiveness.	340	347	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	network
Recent candidate gene studies using a human liver bank and in vivo validation in healthy volunteers identified polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 gene (CYP3A4*22), Ah-receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) genes that are associated with the CYP3A4 phenotype. We hypothesized that the variants identified in these genes may be associated with altered clopidogrel response, since generation of clopidogrel active metabolite is, partially mediated by CYP3A activity. Blood samples from 211 subjects, of mixed racial background, with established coronary artery disease, who had received clopidogrel, were analyzed. Platelet aggregation was determined using light transmittance aggregometry (LTA). Genotyping for CYP2C19*2, CYP3A4*22, PPAR-α (rs4253728, rs4823613), and ARNT (rs2134688) variant alleles was performed using Taqman® assays. CYP2C19*2 genotype was associated with increased on-treatment platelet aggregation (adenosine diphosphate 20 μM; P=0.025). No significant difference in on-treatment platelet aggregation, as measured by LTA during therapy with clopidogrel, was demonstrated among the different genotypes of CYP3A4*22, PPAR-α, and ARNT. These findings suggest that clopidogrel platelet inhibition is not influenced by the genetic variants that have previously been associated with reduced CYP3A4 activity.	607	622	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary artery
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that can lead to severe joint damage and is often associated with a high morbidity and disability. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the mainstay of treatment in RA. DMARDs not only relieve the clinical signs and symptoms of RA but also inhibit the radiographic progression of disease and reduce the effects of chronic systemic inflammation. Since the introduction of biologic DMARDs in the late 1990s, the therapeutic range of options for the management of RA has significantly expanded. However, patients' response to these agents is not uniform with considerable variability in both efficacy and toxicity. There are no reliable means of predicting an individual patient's response to a given DMARD prior to initiation of therapy. In this chapter, the current published literature on the pharmacogenetics of traditional DMARDS and the newer biologic DMARDs in RA is highlighted. Pharmacogenetics may help individualize drug therapy in patients with RA by providing reliable biomarkers to predict medication toxicity and efficacy.	94	99	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint
Rheumatoid arthritis is a crippling autoimmune disease affecting more than 18 million people worldwide and thus becoming one of the important contributors to the global health burden. The majority of the affected are females, especially those above the age of 50, but males and younger adults are equally vulnerable. It is a constellation of genetic and environmental factors that interplay to manifest the joint deformities and disabilities that are the hallmarks of this disease. Painkillers are used alongside disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs to minimize the patient's agony and also to halt the progression of the disease. Worldwide, methotrexate is recommended as the first-line drug, but unexpected resistance is encountered in a significant number of patients. This review summarizes the pathophysiology, clinical findings, and therapeutic strategies for rheumatoid with a focus on research studies performed to establish a genetic basis for response fluctuations of methotrexate across different population groups.	407	412	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint
TNF-α inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy both as monotherapy and in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the treatment of chronic inflammatory immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis (Ps) and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and may be administered off-label to treat disseminated granuloma annulare, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. There are several TNF-α inhibitors available for clinical use including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept. In this article, we discuss the efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of spondyloarthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Etanercept is effective in the treatment of PsA, AS, JIA and uveitis. Independent predictors of achieving a sustained clinical improvement or MDA in children with JIA include shorter disease duration, no concurrent oral corticosteroid use, history of chronic anterior uveitis and age <9 years. IBD incidence was lower in patients receiving etanercept plus MTX. Intra-articular administration of etanercept seems to favor a prompt target joint improvement without serious adverse events. Etanercept improve endothelial function reducing the risk of acute cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events. The most commonly reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, epidermal and dermal conditions, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, headache and fatigue.	1199	1204	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of multiple peripheral joints, which leads to serious destruction of cartilage and bone, progressive deformity and severe disability. Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the first-line drugs commonly used in RA therapy owing to its excellent long-term efficacy and cheapness. However, the efficacy and toxicity of MTX treatment have significant interpatient variability. Genetic factors contribute to this variability. In this review, we have summarized and updated the progress of RA response to MTX treatment since 2009 by focusing on the fields of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Identification of genetic factors involved in MTX treatment response will increase the understanding of RA pathology and the development of new personalized treatments.	118	135	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	peripheral joints
Five to ten percent of all asthmatics, many dozens of millions of patients all over the world, do not respond to maximal medical therapy, including systemic steroids, and the toll of treating them constitutes about eighty percent of the total cost of managing all asthmatics. Other asthmatics who do respond to medical therapy either are not compliant with their medications or suffer from disabling adverse effects. The future therapy of asthma will concentrate on finding medical solutions to these sub-groups of patients but the entire asthmatic population will enjoy its achievements. The future trends in asthma therapy include immunomodulation, managing receptors and inflammatory mediators that are crucial in asthma pathogenesis, formulation of custom-made medications using individual pharmacogenetics, elaborated specific immunotherapy of atopic rhinitis, development of "smart inhalers" and sophisticated techniques in aerosol transportation to the airways, and bronchial thermoplasty which has only recently been approved. The daily clinical implications of these trends will probably unfold in the next five to fifteen years.	960	967	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	airways
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disorder that mainly affects the joints. When left untreated, the disease can result in irreversible joint damage with high morbidity and mortality. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are the cornerstones of treatment in RA. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs not only ameliorate the clinical signs and symptoms of disease, but also prevent the radiographic progression of joint damage. Methotrexate is one such disease-modifying antirheumatic drug that has been used in the treatment of RA for over two decades with excellent long-term efficacy and safety. However, there is significant variability in patients' response to methotrexate, both in terms of efficacy and toxicity. At the present time, there are no reliable means of predicting, a priori, an individual patient's response to methotrexate. In this review, recent published literature on the pharmacogenetics of methotrexate in RA is highlighted. Pharmacogenetics may be a powerful tool for optimizing methotrexate therapy in patients with RA.	154	159	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint

Alirocumab, an antibody that blocks PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), was associated with reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death in the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab). In this study, higher baseline levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) predicted greater benefit from alirocumab treatment. Recent studies indicate high polygenic risk scores (PRS) for coronary artery disease (CAD) identify individuals at higher risk who derive increased benefit from statins. We performed post hoc analyses to determine whether high PRS for CAD identifies higher-risk individuals, independent of baseline LDL-C and other known risk factors, who might derive greater benefit from alirocumab treatment.	508	523	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary artery
CYP2C19 genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention is increasingly implemented in clinical practice. However, challenges such as selecting a testing platform, communicating test results, building clinical decision support processes, providing patient and provider education, and integrating methods to support the translation of emerging evidence to clinical practice are barriers to broad adoption. In this report, we compare and contrast implementation strategies of 12 early adopters, describing solutions to common problems and initial performance metrics for each program. Key differences between programs included the test result turnaround time and timing of therapy changes, which are both related to the CYP2C19 testing model and platform used. Sites reported the need for new informatics infrastructure, expert clinicians such as pharmacists to interpret results, physician champions, and ongoing education. Consensus lessons learned are presented to provide a path forward for those seeking to implement similar clinical pharmacogenomics programs within their institutions.	68	76	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary
Polygenic diseases are caused by the joint contribution of a number of independently acting or interacting polymorphic genes; the individual contribution of each gene may be small or even unnoticeable. The carriage of certain combinations of genes can determine the occurrence of clinically heterogeneous forms of the disease and treatment efficacy. This review describes the approaches used in a polygenic analysis of data in medical genomics, in particular, pharmacogenomics, aimed at identifying the cumulative effect of genes. This effect may result from the summation of gains of different genes or be caused by the epistatic interaction between the genes. Both cases are undoubtedly of great interest in investigating the nature of polygenic diseases. The means that allow one to discriminate between these two possibilities are discussed. The methods for searching for combinations of alleles of different genes associated with the polygenic phenotypic traits of the disease, as well as the methods for presenting and validating the results, are described and compared. An attempt is made to evaluate the applicability of the existing methods to an epistasis analysis. The results obtained by the authors using the APSampler software are described and summarized.	37	42	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint
In patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, a P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist, is the gold standard of antiplatelet therapy. Two more potent P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonists are now available. Pharmacodynamic studies have revealed a large interindividual variability in the biological response to clopidogrel that is primarily related to variable active metabolite generation, depending on clinical factors, drug-drug interactions, and genetic polymorphisms. Several assays to measure platelet function are available and have revealed a high prevalence of high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR). Patients exhibiting HTPR after a clopidogrel loading dose have a higher risk of thrombotic recurrence after percutaneous coronary intervention. A recent consensus has defined HTPR for the main platelet assays available (using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis) to define the optimal cutoff value for each assay in order to predict thrombotic recurrences. In this article, we present several lines of evidence that suggest a therapeutic window of platelet reactivity inhibition with P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonists. Such a paradigm shift is supported by the results of the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial and the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TRITON-TIMI) 38, which showed the superiority of ticagrelor and prasugrel on thrombotic events compared with clopidogrel; however, these 2 medications had an increased bleeding rate. With the results of these trials, in addition to the evidence of a therapeutic window with P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonists, we summarize the potential of platelet reactivity monitoring and pharmacogenomics to tailor therapy.	66	74	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary

The advent of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), as the leading immunosuppressive agents, not only has revolutionized the transplant medicine but also made it a better therapeutic intervention that guarantees the graft outcome and improves the survival rate of patients. However, genetic polymorphism(s) in the CNIs metabolic substrates genes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5) and their transporter such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) can influence the CNIs metabolism and elicit some possible systemic and intra-renal exposures to drugs and/or metabolites with differential risk of nephrotoxicity, jeopardizing the transplantation.	480	491	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	intra-renal
Premature loss of telomere repeats underlies the pathologies of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. Over the past decade, researchers have mapped genetic lesions responsible for the accelerated loss of telomere repeats. Haploinsufficiencies in the catalytic core components of the telomere maintenance enzyme telomerase, as well as genetic defects in telomerase holoenzyme components responsible for enzyme stability, have been linked to hematopoietic failure pathologies. Frequencies of these disease-associated alleles in human populations are low. Accordingly, the diseases themselves are rare. On the other hand, single nucleotide polymorphisms of telomerase enzyme components are found with much higher frequencies, with several non-synonymous SNP alleles observed in 2-4% of the general population. Importantly, recent advents of molecular diagnostic techniques have uncovered links between telomere length maintenance deficiencies and an increasing number of pathologies unrelated to the hematopoietic system. In these cases, short telomere length correlates to tissue renewal capacities and predicts clinical progression and disease severity. To the authors of this review, these new discoveries imply that even minor genetic defects in telomere maintenance can culminate in the premature failure of tissue compartments with high renewal rates. In this review, we discuss the biology and molecules of telomere maintenance, and the pathologies associated with an accelerated loss of telomeres, along with their etiologies. We also discuss single nucleotide polymorphisms of key telomerase components and their association with tissue renewal deficiency syndromes and other pathologies. We suggest that inter-individual variability in telomere maintenance capacity could play a significant role in chronic inflammatory diseases, and that this is not yet fully appreciated in the translational research of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine.	74	85	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	bone marrow
Antiplatelet therapy represents the cornerstone of treatment for the short- and long-term prevention of atherothrombotic disease processes, in particular in high-risk settings such as in patients with acute coronary syndrome and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Currently, dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel represents the most commonly used treatment regimen in these settings. However, a considerable number of patients continue to experience adverse outcomes, including both bleeding and recurrent ischemic events. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that this phenomenon may be, in part, attributed to the broad variability in individual response profiles to this standard antiplatelet treatment regimen, as identified by various assays of platelet function testing. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that genetic polymorphisms may also have an important role in determining levels of platelet inhibition and may be considered as a tool to identify patients at risk of adverse events. This article provides an overview on antiplatelet drug response variability, an update on definitions, including the role of pharmacodynamic testing, underlying mechanisms - with emphasis on recent understandings on pharmacogenetics and drug-drug interactions - and current and future perspectives on individualized antiplatelet therapy.	259	267	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary
It is well established that the CYP2C19 nonfunctional *2 and *3 polymorphisms impair the bioactivation and antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel, and increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events following percutaneous coronary intervention. In contrast, CYP2C19 genotype does not impact clinical response to prasugrel or ticagrelor. Recent studies have evaluated the impact of CYP2C19 genotype-guided selection of antiplatelet therapy on clinical outcomes and begun to close some of the gaps in knowledge and uncertainty that have impeded widespread clinical implementation of this precision medicine approach. This review will critically evaluate recent data and offer new insight into the potential clinical utility of genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy in the context of current clinical practice guidelines.	222	230	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary
Tumor-specific genomic alterations allow systematic identification of genetic interactions that promote tumorigenesis and tumor vulnerabilities, offering novel strategies for development of targeted therapies for individual patients. We develop an Individualized Network-based Co-Mutation (INCM) methodology by inspecting over 2.5 million nonsynonymous somatic mutations derived from 6,789 tumor exomes across 14 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our INCM analysis reveals a higher genetic interaction burden on the significantly mutated genes, experimentally validated cancer genes, chromosome regulatory factors, and DNA damage repair genes, as compared to human pan-cancer essential genes identified by CRISPR-Cas9 screenings on 324 cancer cell lines. We find that genes involved in the cancer type-specific genetic subnetworks identified by INCM are significantly enriched in established cancer pathways, and the INCM-inferred putative genetic interactions are correlated with patient survival. By analyzing drug pharmacogenomics profiles from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, we show that the network-predicted putative genetic interactions (e.g., BRCA2-TP53) are significantly correlated with sensitivity/resistance of multiple therapeutic agents. We experimentally validated that afatinib has the strongest cytotoxic activity on BT474 (IC50 = 55.5 nM, BRCA2 and TP53 co-mutant) compared to MCF7 (IC50 = 7.7 μM, both BRCA2 and TP53 wild type) and MDA-MB-231 (IC50 = 7.9 μM, BRCA2 wild type but TP53 mutant). Finally, drug-target network analysis reveals several potential druggable genetic interactions by targeting tumor vulnerabilities. This study offers a powerful network-based methodology for identification of candidate therapeutic pathways that target tumor vulnerabilities and prioritization of potential pharmacogenomics biomarkers for development of personalized cancer medicine.	1552	1571	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	drug-target network
About 30% of approved drugs are cleared predominantly by renal clearance (CL<sub>r</sub>). Of these, many are secreted by transporters. For these drugs, in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation of transporter-mediated renal secretory clearance (CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub>) is important to prospectively predict their renal clearance and to assess the impact of drug-drug interactions and pharmacogenetics on their pharmacokinetics. Here we compared the ability of the relative expression factor (REF) and the relative activity factor (RAF) approaches to quantitatively predict the in vivo CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> of 26 organic anion transporter (OAT) substrates assuming that OAT-mediated uptake is the rate-determining step in the CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> of the drugs. The REF approach requires protein quantification of each transporter in the tissue (e.g., kidney) and transporter-expressing cells, whereas the RAF approach requires the use of a transporter-selective probe substrate (both in vitro and in vivo) for each transporter of interest. For the REF approach, 50% and 69% of the CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> predictions were within 2- and 3-fold of the observed values, respectively; the corresponding values for the RAF approach were 65% and 81%. We found no significant difference between the two approaches in their predictive capability (as measured by accuracy and bias) of the CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> or CL<sub>r</sub> of OAT drugs. We recommend that the REF and RAF approaches can be used interchangeably to predict OAT-mediated CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> Further research is warranted to evaluate the ability of the REF or RAF approach to predict CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> of drugs when uptake is not the rate-determining step. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This is the first direct comparison of the relative expression factor (REF) and relative activity factor (RAF) approaches to predict transporter-mediated renal clearance (CL<sub>r</sub>). The RAF, but not REF, approach requires transporter-selective probes and that the basolateral uptake is the rate-determining step in the CL<sub>r</sub> of drugs. Given that there is no difference in predictive capability of the REF and RAF approach for organic anion transporter-mediated CL<sub>r</sub>, the REF approach should be explored further to assess its ability to predict CL<sub>r</sub> when basolateral uptake is not the sole rate-determining step.	579	581	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	CL

Here we compared the ability of the relative expression factor (REF) and the relative activity factor (RAF) approaches to quantitatively predict the in vivo CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> of 26 organic anion transporter (OAT) substrates assuming that OAT-mediated uptake is the rate-determining step in the CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> of the drugs. The REF approach requires protein quantification of each transporter in the tissue (e.g., kidney) and transporter-expressing cells, whereas the RAF approach requires the use of a transporter-selective probe substrate (both in vitro and in vivo) for each transporter of interest. For the REF approach, 50% and 69% of the CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> predictions were within 2- and 3-fold of the observed values, respectively; the corresponding values for the RAF approach were 65% and 81%. We found no significant difference between the two approaches in their predictive capability (as measured by accuracy and bias) of the CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> or CL<sub>r</sub> of OAT drugs. We recommend that the REF and RAF approaches can be used interchangeably to predict OAT-mediated CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> Further research is warranted to evaluate the ability of the REF or RAF approach to predict CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> of drugs when uptake is not the rate-determining step. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This is the first direct comparison of the relative expression factor (REF) and relative activity factor (RAF) approaches to predict transporter-mediated renal clearance (CL<sub>r</sub>). The RAF, but not REF, approach requires transporter-selective probes and that the basolateral uptake is the rate-determining step in the CL<sub>r</sub> of drugs. Given that there is no difference in predictive capability of the REF and RAF approach for organic anion transporter-mediated CL<sub>r</sub>, the REF approach should be explored further to assess its ability to predict CL<sub>r</sub> when basolateral uptake is not the sole rate-determining step.	1379	1381	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	CL

Pharmacogenetics offers a way to personalize medication prescribing for patients. Through the use of genetic tests that identify variations in enzymes important to drug metabolism, PAs can have patients' genetic information before prescribing a medication. This may reduce the risks of adverse reactions and lost treatment time when patients are given drugs to which they are unlikely to respond. Laboratory testing can identify common genetic variants that alter how the body metabolizes drugs. PAs with knowledge of these variants can choose medications that are more personalized and effective for each patient. Clinical pharmacogenetic guidelines are under development and will help providers identify which drugs are most likely to be affected by genetic variations so they can prescribe for patients based on their specific genetic phenotypes.	496	499	ORGAN	PAs
Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies. The classical symptoms of FXIII deficiency span from intracranial haemorrhage to delay bleeding or the staying of chronic wounds in the skin including impaired mucosal healing. In this view, FXIII bridges primary haemostasis, coagulation and definite tissue healing. Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing. Accordingly, adequate FXIII levels can drive and predict the prognosis of complex diseases and the outcome of the associated therapies or interventions. In addition, peculiar pharmacogenetics aspects of the FXIII gene are of extraordinary interest. The present review accounts for the recognized role of FXIII in the healing process and gives some examples on how to use it as prognostic biological/ molecular marker or as potential tailored therapeutic molecule in complex diseases.	871	876	ORGAN	bowel

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are very common variants of many genes and are also promising markers associated with drug reactions in pharmacogenomics research. In pediatric organ transplantation, tacrolimus is a major immunosuppressive agent used to prevent organ rejection. The SNP of these genes have been studied extensively in adult population, but there is no systematic review in children. This article focuses on the effects of ABCB1 and CYP3A SNPs on tacrolimus in children who are undergoing organ transplantations.	183	188	ORGAN	organ

Mithramycin demonstrates preclinical anticancer activity, but its therapeutic dose is limited by the development of hepatotoxicity that remains poorly characterized. A pharmacogenomics characterization of mithramycin-induced transaminitis revealed that hepatotoxicity is associated with germline variants in genes involved in bile disposition: <i>ABCB4</i> (multidrug resistance 3) rs2302387 and <i>ABCB11</i> [bile salt export pump (BSEP)] rs4668115 reduce transporter expression (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and were associated with ≥grade 3 transaminitis developing 24 hours after the third infusion of mithramycin (25 mcg/kg, 6 hours/infusion, every day ×7, every 28 days; <i>P</i> < 0.0040). A similar relationship was observed in a pediatric cohort. We therefore undertook to characterize the mechanism of mithramycin-induced acute transaminitis. As mithramycin affects cellular response to bile acid treatment by altering the expression of multiple bile transporters (e.g., ABCB4, ABCB11, sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, organic solute transporter <i>α</i>/<i>β</i>) in several cell lines [Huh7, HepaRG, HepaRG BSEP (-/-)] and primary human hepatocytes, we hypothesized that mithramycin inhibited bile-mediated activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR was downregulated in all hepatocyte cell lines and primary human hepatocytes (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and mithramycin inhibited chenodeoxycholic acid- and GW4046-induced FXR-galactose-induced gene 4 luciferase reporter activity (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Mithramycin promoted glycochenodeoxycholic acid-induced cytotoxicity in <i>ABCB11</i> (-<i>/</i>-) cells and increased the overall intracellular concentration of bile acids in primary human hepatocytes grown in sandwich culture (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Mithramycin is a FXR expression and FXR transactivation inhibitor that inhibits bile flow and potentiates bile-induced cellular toxicity, particularly in cells with low ABCB11 function. These results suggest that mithramycin causes hepatotoxicity through derangement of bile acid disposition; results also suggest that pharmacogenomic markers may be useful to identify patients who may tolerate higher mithramycin doses. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The present study characterizes a novel mechanism of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in which mithramycin not only alters farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner gene expression but also inhibits bile acid binding to FXR, resulting in deregulation of cellular bile homeostasis. Two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms in bile flow transporters are associated with mithramycin-induced liver function test elevations, and the present results are the rationale for a genotype-directed clinical trial using mithramycin in patients with thoracic malignancies.	2608	2613	ORGAN	liver
Although statins are effective in treating high cholesterol, adverse effects do occur with their use. Efficacy and tolerability vary among statins in different ethnic groups. Indigenous Australians have a high risk for cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Prescribing statins to Indigenous Australians with multi-morbidity requires different strategies to increase efficacy and reduce their toxicity. Previous studies have reported that Indigenous Australians are more susceptible to severe statin-induced myopathies. However, there is a lack of evidence in the underlying genetic factors in this population. This review aims to identify: inter-ethnic differences in the efficacy and safety of statins; major contributing factors accounting for any identified differences; and provide an overview of statin-induced adverse effects in Indigenous Australians.	238	244	ORGAN	kidney
<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Osteosarcoma is the malignant bone tumor most common in children and adolescents. Many cytochrome P-450 (CYP) members detoxify anticancer drugs used in osteosarcoma treatment, and thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate <i>CYP</i> polymorphisms in osteosarcoma patients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The present study investigated DNA from peripheral blood from 70 osteosarcoma patients treated with high doses of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. <i>CYP1A2*1F</i> (163C>A; rs762551); <i>CYP2C9*3</i> (1075A>C; rs1057910); and <i>CYP3A5*3</i> (6986A>G; rs776746) polymorphisms were investigated through real-time PCR using TaqMan probes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The <i>CYP2C9*3</i> allele did not present any association with clinical events. The <i>CYP1A2</i> CC/AC genotypes were associated with ototoxicity occurrence (<i>p</i> = 0.041, odds ratio [OR] = 8.4) and high grades of ototoxicity (<i>p</i> = 0.039, OR = 10.7), when compared with patients carrying the <i>CYP1A2</i> AA genotype. The <i>CYP1A2</i> CC genotype was associated with high grades of diarrhea (<i>p</i> = 0.043, OR = 4.6) and fever (<i>p</i> = 0.041, OR = 7.1) in comparison with the <i>CYP1A2</i> AA/AC genotypes. The <i>CYP3A5</i> CC genotype was associated with weight loss (<i>p</i> = 0.009, OR = 3.8) and high grades of hepatotoxicity (<i>p</i> = 0.010, OR = 4.3) when compared with the <i>CYP3A5</i> TT/CT genotypes. The <i>CYP3A5</i> CC/CT genotypes were associated with high grades of vomit (<i>p</i> = 0.013, OR = 10.8), pulmonary relapse absence (<i>p</i> = 0.029, OR = 9.5), and better overall and event-free survivals (<i>p</i> = 0.017, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.1; <i>p</i> = 0.044, HR = 2.5; respectively) when compared with the <i>CYP3A5</i> AA genotype. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b><i>CYP1A2*1A</i> and <i>CYP3A5*3</i> alleles were associated with toxicity events. <i>CYP3A5*3</i> allele was associated with better survival. Thus, <i>CYP</i> genotypes might be promising markers to tailoring treatment in osteosarcoma patients.	1542	1551	ORGAN	pulmonary
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affects patient outcomes and satisfaction. New research has centered on evaluation of post-discharge and opioid-related nausea and vomiting. Mechanical and drug effects stimulate the release of central nervous system neurotransmitters acting at receptors in the vomiting center, area postrema, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Brain surgery has allowed insight into specific central emetogenic areas. Stimuli from peripheral organs act through afferent vagus neurons and a parasympathetic response causing nausea and vomiting. Opioids stimulate mu receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and cholinergic receptors in the vestibular system. Opioids also affect gastrointestinal (GI) tract mechanics by decreasing gastric emptying, intestinal motility, GI peristalsis, and secretions. Regional blocks and non-opioid multimodal analgesia help to decrease nausea and vomiting. Patient, surgery, and anesthesia factors contribute to risk and degree of PONV experienced. Pharmacogenetics plays a role in gene typing as antiemetic medication metabolism results in varying drug effectiveness. Risk scoring systems are available. Individualized multimodal plans can be designed as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol.	370	375	ORGAN	Brain

The peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are the key components of innate-immunity, and are highly specific for the recognition of bacterial peptidoglycans (PGN). Among different mammalian PGRPs, the PGRP1 binds to murein PGN of Gram-positive bacteria (lysine-type) and also have bactericidal activity towards Gram-negative bacteria (diaminopimelic acid or Dap-type). Buffaloes are the major sources of milk and meat in Asian sub-continents and are highly exposed to bacterial infections. The PGRP activates the innate-immune signaling, but their studies has been confined to limited species due to lack of structural and functional information. So, to understand the structural constituents, 3D model of buffalo PGRP1 (bfPGRP1) was constructed and conformational and dynamics properties of bfPGRP1 was studied. The bfPGRP1 model highly resembled human and camel PGRP structure, and shared a highly flexible N-terminus and centrally placed L-shaped cleft. Docking simulation of muramyl-tripeptide, tetrapeptide, pentapeptide-Dap-(MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap and MPP-Dap) and lysine-type (MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys) in AutoDock 4.2 and ArgusLab 4.0.1 anticipated β1, α2, α4, β4, and loops connecting β1-α2, α2-β2, β3-β4 and α4-α5 as the key interacting domains. The bfPGRP1-ligand complex molecular dynamics simulation followed by free binding energy (BE) computation conceded BE values of -18.30, -35.53, -41.80, -25.03, -24.62 and -22.30 kJ mol(-1) for MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap, MPP-Dap, MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys, respectively. The groove-surface and key binding residues involved in PGN-Dap and Lys-type interaction intended by the molecular docking, and were also accompanied by significant BE values directed their importance in pharmacogenomics, and warrants further in vivo studies for drug targeting and immune signaling pathways exploration.	418	422	ORGAN	meat
The calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus, cornerstone of most immunosuppressive regimens, is a drug with a narrow therapeutic window: underexposure can lead to allograft rejection and overexposure can result in an increased incidence of infections, toxicity and malignancies.

This review focusses on the clinical aspects of tacrolimus pharmacodynamics, such as efficacy and toxicity. Factors affecting tacrolimus pharmacokinetics, including pharmacogenetics and the rationale for routine CYP3A5*1/*3 genotyping in prospective paediatric renal transplant recipients, are also reviewed. Therapeutic drug monitoring, including pre-dose concentrations and pharmacokinetic profiles with the available "reference values", are discussed. Factors contributing to high intra-patient variability in tacrolimus exposure and its impact on clinical outcome are also reviewed.

<b></b>Breast cancer is the fifth cause of cancer death among women worldwide and represents a global health concern due to the lack of effective therapeutic regimens that could be applied to all disease groups. Nowadays, strategies based on pharmacogenomics constitute novel approaches that minimize toxicity while maximizing drug efficacy; this being of high importance in the oncology setting. Besides, genetic profiling of malignant tumors can lead to the development of targeted therapies to be included in effective drug regimens. Advances in molecular diagnostics have revealed that breast cancer is a multifaceted disease, characterized by inter-tumoral and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and, unlike the past, molecular classifications based on the expression of individual biomarkers have led to devising novel therapeutic strategies that improve patient survival. In this review, we report and discuss the molecular classification of breast cancer subtypes, the heterogeneity resource, and the advantages and disadvantages of current drug regimens with consideration of pharmacogenomics in response and resistance to treatment.	666	679	ORGAN	intra-tumoral

The degree of nephrotoxicity is dictated by the selective accumulation of cisplatin in renal tubule cells due to: (1) uptake by organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and copper transporter 1 (CTR1); (2) metabolism by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and γ-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1); and (3) efflux by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1). The purpose of this study was to determine the significance of single nucleotide polymorphisms that regulate the expression and function of transporters and metabolism genes implicated in development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cisplatin treated patients. Changes in the kidney function were assessed using novel urinary protein biomarkers and traditional markers. Genotyping was conducted by the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System using a custom open array chip with metabolism, transport, and transcription factor polymorphisms of interest to cisplatin disposition and toxicity. Traditional and novel biomarker assays for kidney toxicity were assessed for differences according to genotype by ANOVA. Allele and genotype frequencies were determined based on Caucasian population frequencies. The polymorphisms rs596881 (<i>SLC22A2</i>/OCT2), and rs12686377 and rs7851395 (<i>SLC31A1</i>/CTR1) were associated with renoprotection and maintenance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Polymorphisms in <i>SLC22A2</i>/OCT2, <i>SLC31A1</i>/CTRI, <i>SLC47A1</i>/MATE1, <i>ABCC2</i>/MRP2, and <i>GSTP1</i> were significantly associated with increases in the urinary excretion of novel AKI biomarkers: KIM-1, TFF3, MCP1, NGAL, clusterin, cystatin C, and calbindin. Knowledge concerning which genotypes in drug transporters are associated with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity may help to identify at-risk patients and initiate strategies, such as using lower or fractionated cisplatin doses or avoiding cisplatin altogether, in order to prevent AKI.	731	737	ORGAN	kidney

Anxiety disorders are chronic disorders appearing with a high frequency in the general population and causing much distress to those suffering from them. The current common treatment consists of antidepressants, primarily from the serotonin-selective-reuptake-inhibitor (SSRI) class. However, despite the relative effectiveness of these medications the patients' responses vary widely with one third not responding at all. While we do not currently have the ability to predict who will respond positively to the medication, it is hoped that genetic research will make it possible to prospectively identify responders and thus help avoid failed treatment attempts and side-effects. The field of pharmacogenetics is divided into pharmaco-kinetics (genetic factors that influence the drug metabolism in the body) and pharmco-dynamics (genetic factors that affect the response to the drug at the level of the receptors/transporters/enzymes in the target organs). Contrary to the treatment of depression, there is little research available on the pharmacogenetics of anxiety disorders and the existing research coincides with the studies on depression. The primary pharmacogenetic-dynamic findings are related to serotonergic genes of which those with the long allele of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) are expected to respond positively to treatment, and the same is true regarding genetic variants of several serotonin receptors. The pharmacogenetic-kinetic findings focus on the CYP450 enzyme system. The hope is that with the progression of the pharmacogenetic research new genetic variants will be discovered which, when combined with the clinical characteristics of those suffering from anxiety disorders, will enable the development of novel treatment algorithms to be customized for each patient.	950	956	ORGAN	organs

Personalized medicine is defined as individualized treatment based on the individual's genetic variants. Such treatment has the potential to enable pharmacogenetics, such as the prevention of 100,000 deaths per year in the USA because of adverse drug reactions or specify treatment in heart failure such at the beta 1 adrenergic receptor polymorphisms. It is claimed that coronary artery disease (CAD) is at least 50% because of genetic predisposition. Identification of the genes predisposing to CAD would greatly facilitate prevention, early treatment, and more specific therapies. The arrival of the multimillion single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array provides the high throughput genotyping required to perform genome-wide Association (GWA) studies. These studies require markers (SNPs) at intervals of 6,000 bp and sample size of several thousands. Platforms are available to genotype and process millions of genotypes per day. The GWA performed by the Ottawa Heart Genomic Study identified the first deoxyribonucleic acid region (9p21) predisposing to CAD after replication in six independent populations totaling 23,000. This was subsequently confirmed in several independent studies totally more than 45,000 individuals. The region confers a risk for CAD independent of known risk factors. 9p21 occurs in heterozygous form in 40 to 50% of Caucasians with increased risk of 15 to 20% and in homozygous form in 25% of Caucasians with increased risk of 40%. Identification of the genes predisposing to CAD is a prerequisite for personalized care of these patients. It is anticipated that most of the genes predisposing to CAD will be identified in the next 5 to 8 years. The 9p21, in addition to conferring increased risk, provides the bonus of being independent of known risk factors. Thus, 9p21 is likely to provide the impetus and nidus for a major research effort over the next few years. It has the potential to not only provide for early genetic screening but also as a target for novel therapy.	285	290	ORGAN	heart

The advent of anti-TNF agents as the first approved targeted therapy in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients has made a major impact on our existing therapeutic algorithms. They have not only been approved for induction and maintenance treatment in IBD patients, but have also enabled us to define and achieve novel therapeutic outcomes, such as combination of clinical symptom control and endoscopic remission, as well as mucosal healing. Nevertheless, approximately one third of treated patients do not respond to initiated anti-TNF therapy and these treatments are associated with sometimes severe systemic side-effects. There is therefore the currently unmet clinical need do establish predictive markers of response to identify the subgroup of IBD patients, that have a heightened probability of response. There have so far been approaches from different fields of IBD research, to descry markers that would empower us to apply TNF-inhibitors in a more rational manner. These markers encompass findings from disease-related and clinical factors, pharmacokinetics, biochemical markers, blood and stool derived parameters, pharmacogenomics, microbial species, metabolic compounds, and mucosal factors. Furthermore, changes in the intestinal immune cell composition in response to therapeutic pressure of anti-TNF treatment have recently been implicated in the process of molecular resistance to these drugs. Insights into factors that determine resistance to anti-TNF therapy give reasonable hope, that a more targeted approach can then be utilized in these non-responders. Here, IL-23 could be identified as one of the key factors determining resistance to TNF-inhibitors. Growing insights into the molecular mechanism of action of TNF-inhibitors might also enable us to derive critical molecular markers that not only mediate the clinical effects of anti-TNF therapy, but which level of expression might also correlate with its therapeutic efficacy. In this narrative review, we present an overview of currently identified possible predictive markers for successful anti-TNF therapy and discuss identified molecular pathways that drive resistance to these substances. We will also point out the necessity and difficulty of developing and validating a diagnostic marker concerning clinically relevant outcome parameters, before they can finally enter daily clinical practice and enable a more personalized therapeutic approach.	102	107	ORGAN	bowel
Thiopurines are the cornerstone of treatment for a wide variety of medical disorders, ranging from pediatric leukemia to inflammatory bowel disease. Because of their complex metabolism and potential toxicities, the use of biomarkers to predict risk and response is paramount. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase and thiopurine metabolite levels have emerged as companion diagnostics with crucial roles in facilitating safe and effective treatment. This review serves to update the reader on how these tools are being developed and implemented in clinical practice. A useful paradigm in thiopurine therapeutic strategy is presented, along with fresh insights into the mechanisms underlying these approaches. We elaborate on potential future developments in the optimization of thiopurine therapy.	134	139	ORGAN	bowel
Reported prevalence rates of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are between 8% to 20% in the US general population with an average medical expenditure of US$1.35 billion direct and US$205 million indirect costs. Current pathophysiologic theories are based on abnormalities of both the brain and gut, thus setting a new stage for current and future therapeutic approaches. There are numerous treatment options in IBS acting centrally and peripherally by influencing motility and visceral sensitivity. Clinical evidence is variable; however, newer emerging treatments are being evaluated using better-designed clinical trials. Accurate assessment of IBS drug efficacy is still hampered by heterogeneity of the IBS population. Novel methods such as pharmacogenomics or brain imaging may be helpful in the future to better understand and characterize IBS patient subtypes, and this in turn will lead to more specific and efficient therapeutic options. Patient subpopulation measurement of side effects is also a clinical challenge and further understanding could improve treatment efficacy enhancing the patient compliance.	39	44	ORGAN	bowel

DNA biosensors are attractive tools for genetic analysis as there is an increasing need for rapid and low-cost DNA analysis, primarily driven by applications in personalized pharmacogenomics, clinical diagnostics, rapid pathogen detection, food traceability and forensics. A rapid electrochemical genosensor detection methodology exploiting a combination of modified primers for solution-phase isothermal amplification, followed by rapid detection via hybridization on gold electrodes is reported. Modified reverse primers, exploiting a C18 spacer between the primer-binding site and an engineered single stranded tail, are used in a recombinase polymerase amplification reaction to produce an amplicon with a central duplex flanked by two single stranded tails. These tails are designed to be complementary to a gold electrode tethered capture oligo probe as well as a horseradish peroxidase labelled reporter oligo probe. The time required for hybridization of the isothermally generated amplicons with each of the immobilized and reporter probes was optimised to be 2 min, in both cases. The effect of amplification time and the limit of detection were evaluated using these hybridization times for both single stranded and double stranded DNA templates. The best detection limit of 70 fM for a ssDNA template was achieved using 45 min amplification, whilst for a dsDNA template, just 30 min amplification resulted in a slightly lower detection limit of 14 fM, whilst both 20 and 45 min amplification times were observed to provide detection limits of 71 and 72 fM, respectively, but 30 and 45 min amplification resulted in a much higher signal and sensitivity. The genosensor was applied to genomic DNA and real patient and control blood samples for detection of the coeliac disease associated DQB1*02 HLA allele, as a model system, demonstrating the possibility to carry out molecular diagnostics, combining amplification and detection in a rapid and facile manner.	1771	1778	ORGAN	coeliac
Early prediction of clearance mechanisms allows for the rapid progression of drug discovery and development programs, and facilitates risk assessment of the pharmacokinetic variability associated with drug interactions and pharmacogenomics. Here we propose a scientific framework--Extended Clearance Classification System (ECCS)--which can be used to predict the predominant clearance mechanism (rate-determining process) based on physicochemical properties and passive membrane permeability. Compounds are classified as: Class 1A--metabolism as primary systemic clearance mechanism (high permeability acids/zwitterions with molecular weight (MW) ≤400 Da), Class 1B--transporter-mediated hepatic uptake as primary systemic clearance mechanism (high permeability acids/zwitterions with MW >400 Da), Class 2--metabolism as primary clearance mechanism (high permeability bases/neutrals), Class 3A--renal clearance (low permeability acids/zwitterions with MW ≤400 Da), Class 3B--transporter mediated hepatic uptake or renal clearance (low permeability acids/zwitterions with MW >400 Da), and Class 4--renal clearance (low permeability bases/neutrals). The performance of the ECCS framework was validated using 307 compounds with single clearance mechanism contributing to ≥70% of systemic clearance. The apparent permeability across clonal cell line of Madin - Darby canine kidney cells, selected for low endogenous efflux transporter expression, with a cut-off of 5 × 10(-6) cm/s was used for permeability classification, and the ionization (at pH7) was assigned based on calculated pKa. The proposed scheme correctly predicted the rate-determining clearance mechanism to be either metabolism, hepatic uptake or renal for ~92% of total compounds. We discuss the general characteristics of each ECCS class, as well as compare and contrast the framework with the biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) and the biopharmaceutics drug disposition classification system (BDDCS). Collectively, the ECCS framework is valuable in early prediction of clearance mechanism and can aid in choosing the right preclinical tool kit and strategy for optimizing drug exposure and evaluating clinical risk of pharmacokinetic variability caused by drug interactions and pharmacogenomics.	1171	1175	ORGAN	ECCS

Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. In recent decades, OS treatment has reached a plateau and drug resistance is still a major challenge. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the expression of the genes related to pharmacogenetics in OS. The expression of 32 target genes in 80 paired specimens (pre-chemotherapeutic primary tumor, post-chemotherapeutic primary tumor and pulmonary metastasis) obtained from 33 patients diagnosed with OS were analyzed by the real-time PCR methodology. As the calibrators (control), five normal bone specimens were used. The present study identified associations between the OS outcome and the expression of the genes <i>TOP2A</i>, <i>DHFR</i>, <i>MTHFR</i>, <i>BCL2L1</i>, <i>CASP3</i>, <i>FASLG</i>, <i>GSTM3</i>, <i>SOD1</i>, ABCC1, <i>ABCC2</i>, <i>ABCC3</i>, <i>ABCC5</i>, <i>ABCC6</i>, <i>ABCC10</i>, <i>ABCC11</i>, <i>ABCG2</i>, <i>RALBP1</i>, <i>SLC19A1</i>, <i>SLC22A1</i>, <i>ERCC1</i> and <i>MSH2</i>. In addition, the expression of the <i>ABCC10</i>, <i>GGH</i>, <i>GSTM3</i> and <i>SLC22A1</i> genes were associated with the disease event, and the metastasis specimens showed a high expression profile of <i>ABCC1</i>, <i>ABCC3</i> and <i>ABCC4</i> genes and a low expression of <i>SLC22A1</i> and <i>ABCC10</i> genes, which is possibly an important factor for resistance in OS metastasis. Therefore, our findings may, in the future, contribute to clinical management as prognostic factors as well as possible therapeutic targets.	432	441	ORGAN	pulmonary
Nimodipine, an L-type cerebroselective calcium channel antagonist, is the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the neuroprotection of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Four randomized, placebo-controlled trials of nimodipine demonstrated clinical improvement over placebo; however, these occurred before precision medicine with pharmacogenomics was readily available. The standard enteral dose of nimodipine recommended after aSAH is 60 mg every 4 h. However, up to 78% of patients with aSAH develop systemic arterial hypotension after taking the drug at the recommended dose, which could theoretically limit its neuroprotective role and worsen cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow, particularly when concomitant vasospasm is present. We investigated the association between nimodipine dose changes and clinical outcomes in a consecutive series of 150 patients (mean age, 56 years; 70.7% women) with acute aSAH. We describe the pharmacogenomic relationship of nimodipine dose reduction with clinical outcomes. These results have major implications for future individualized dosing of nimodipine in the era of precision medicine.	693	701	ORGAN	cerebral
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To examine whether serotonin (5-HT) related genetic variants moderate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) at the radius, lumbar spine (LS) BMD, total body less head (TBLH) bone mineral content (BMC) and markers of bone metabolism (osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX-1], and bone specific alkaline phosphatase to CTX-1 ratio) were examined in an observational study, enrolling 15- to 20-year-old participants, unmedicated or within a month of SSRI initiation.

Monitoring and treating iron overload is crucial in transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients. Liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography and T2* magnetic resonance imaging represent non-invasive ways to evaluate the adequacy of the iron chelation treatment. We explored the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in vitamin D metabolism, transport and activity, and in deferasirox metabolism on liver iron burden parameters. One-hundred and five beta-thalassaemia patients, treated with deferasirox, have been enrolled. Drug plasma C<sub>trough</sub> and AUC were measured by a HPLC-UV method. Allelic discrimination was performed by real-time PCR. Age, UGT1A1-364 CT/TT and CYP27B1 -1260 GT/TT positively predicted liver stiffness values. Deferasirox dose and serum ferritin negatively predicted T2* data, whereas age and CYP2D6 1457 GG genotype positively influenced these values. The discoveries of this research may be useful for personalized medicine and the proposed method could be applied in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and myelodysplastic syndromes.	97	102	ORGAN	Liver

Allelic discrimination was performed by real-time PCR. Age, UGT1A1-364 CT/TT and CYP27B1 -1260 GT/TT positively predicted liver stiffness values. Deferasirox dose and serum ferritin negatively predicted T2* data, whereas age and CYP2D6 1457 GG genotype positively influenced these values. The discoveries of this research may be useful for personalized medicine and the proposed method could be applied in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and myelodysplastic syndromes.	419	424	ORGAN	liver
Monitoring and treating iron overload is crucial in transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients.

The kidney has attracted the attention of diabetologists as an organ involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis not only by gluconeogenesis, but also by renal glucose excretion. Sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs), particularly SGLT2, are responsible for reabsorption of up to 99% of the filtered glucose. SGLT2 is coded by the SLC5A2 gene, which maps on chromosome 16. Pharmacological reduction of tubular glucose reabsorption results in improved glycemic control in Type 2 diabetic patients. Since the SGLTs reabsorb most of the filtered glucose (90%), it is not surprising that mutations in SLC5A2 cause familial renal glucosuria. A recent study pointed out a possible role of common genetic variation in SLC5A2 in the control of glucose homeostasis. SLC5A2 polymorphisms might therefore represent potential candidates for pharmacogenomic studies targeting the impact of these variants on the efficacy of antidiabetic treatment that is based on inhibition of SGLT2 activity.	4	10	ORGAN	kidney

Paritaprevir (PTV) is a non-structural protein 3/4A protease inhibitor developed for the treatment of hepatitis C disease as a fixed dose combination of ombitasvir (OBV) and ritonavir (RTV) with or without dasabuvir. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 on in vitro PTV metabolism using human recombinant CYP3A4, CYP3A5 (rCYP3A4, rCYP3A5) and human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped as either CYP3A5*1/*1, CYP3A5*1/*3 or CYP3A5*3/*3. The intrinsic clearance (CL<sub>int</sub>, V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) for the production of a metabolite from PTV in rCYP3A4 was 1.5 times higher than that in rCYP3A5. The PTV metabolism in CYP3A5*1/*1 and CYP3A5*1/*3 HLMs expressing CYP3A5 was comparable to that in CYP3A5*3/*3 HLMs, which lack CYP3A5. CYP3A4 expression level was significantly correlated with PTV disappearance rate and metabolite formation. In contrast, there was no such correlation found for CYP3A5 expression level. This study represents that the major CYP isoform involved in PTV metabolism is CYP3A4, with CYP3A5 having a minor role in PTV metabolism. The findings of the present study may provide foundational information on PTV metabolism, and may further support dosing practices in HCV-infected patients prescribed PTV-based therapy.	308	311	ORGAN	PTV

Metoprolol is a medication commonly utilized in select patients to achieve a reduction in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, or other indications. A majority of metoprolol metabolism occurs via <i>CYP2D6</i>. Decreased expression of the CYP2D6 enzyme increases the concentration of metoprolol. Current pharmacogenomics guidelines by the Dutch Pharmacogenomics Working Group recommend slower titrations and dose decreases to minimize adverse effects from poor metabolizers or normal metabolizers taking concomitant medications that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (phenoconverters). This study aimed to evaluate adverse effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope in patients who are expected to have absent CYP2D6 enzyme activity due to drug-drug or drug-gene interactions. The secondary aims of this study were to evaluate heart rate measurements for the included participants. Retrospective data were collected for individuals with <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping results obtained for clinical purposes. Three categories (CYP2D6 normal metabolizers, poor metabolizers, and phenoconverters) were assigned. A total of 325 participants were included. There was no statistically significant difference found in the primary composite outcome between the three metabolizer groups (<i>p</i> = 0.054). However, a statistically significant difference was identified in the incidences of bradycardia between the poor metabolizers and the normal metabolizers or phenoconverters (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The average heart rates were 2.8 beats per minute (bpm) and 2.6 bpm lower for the poor metabolizer and phenoconverter groups, respectively, compared to the normal metabolizers (<i>p</i> < 0.0001 for both comparisons). This study further supports the role of genetic testing in precision medicine to help individualize patient care as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking metoprolol were found to have an increase in bradycardia. Additional research is needed to clarify the dose relationship in this drug-gene interaction.	90	95	ORGAN	heart

A review of the pharmacogenetics (PGt) and pathophysiology of calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 S (CACNA1S) mutations in malignant hyperthermia susceptibility type 5 (MHS5; MIM #60188) is presented. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a life-threatening hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle usually induced by volatile, halogenated anesthetics and/or the depolarizing neuromuscular blocker succinylcholine. In addition to ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) mutations, several CACNA1S mutations are known to be risk factors for increased susceptibility to MH (MHS). However, the presence of these pathogenic CACNA1S gene variations cannot be used to positively predict MH since the condition is genetically heterogeneous with variable expression and incomplete penetrance. At present, one or at most six CACNA1S mutations display significant linkage or association either to clinically diagnosed MH or to MHS as determined by contracture testing. Additional pathogenic variants in CACNA1S, either alone or in combination with genes affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, are likely to be discovered in association to MH as whole exome sequencing becomes more commonplace.	284	299	ORGAN	skeletal muscle

In kidney transplantation, tacrolimus (TAC) is at the cornerstone of current immunosuppressive strategies. Though because of its narrow therapeutic index, it is critical to ensure that TAC levels are maintained within this sharp window through reactive adjustments. This would allow maximizing efficiency while limiting drug-associated toxicity. However, TAC high intra- and inter-patient pharmacokinetic (PK) variability makes it more laborious to accurately predict the appropriate dosage required for a given patient.	3	9	ORGAN	kidney
Efavirenz (EFV) is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor commonly used as first-line therapy in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with a narrow therapeutic range and a high between-subject variability which can lead to central nervous system toxicity or therapeutic failure. To characterize the sources of variability and better predict EFV steady-state plasma concentrations, a population pharmacokinetic model was developed from 96 HIV-positive individuals, using a nonlinear mixed-effect method with Monolix® software. A one-compartment with first-order absorption and elimination model adequately described the data. To explain between-subject variability, demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters, hepatitis C virus-HIV coinfection, and genetic polymorphisms were tested. A combination of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs2279343 and rs3745274, both in the CYP2B6 gene, were the only covariates influencing clearance, included in the final model. Oral clearance was estimated to be 19.6 L/h, 14.15 L/h, and 6.08 L/h for wild-type, heterozygous mutated and homozygous mutated individuals, respectively. These results are in accordance with the current knowledge of EFV metabolism and also suggest that in homozygous mutated individuals, a dose adjustment is necessary. Hepatitis C virus-HIV coinfection does not seem to be a predictive indicator of EFV pharmacokinetic disposition.	997	1001	ORGAN	Oral
The 21st century has witnessed the discovery of multiple rare and common gene variants associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and these discoveries have already provided a starting point for the investigation of the biology of the disorder and novel treatments. The purpose of this selective review is to examine genetic findings from the past 5 years and consider their implications for the conceptualization of ADHD and future clinical practice. Recent discoveries reveal the strong genetic overlaps between ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as intellectual disability. Thus, the removal of the previous diagnostic exclusion criteria for ADHD in the presence of ASD is a welcome change in DSM-5. However, ADHD also shows substantial genetic correlations with a much broader group of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as with nonpsychiatric conditions (e.g., lung cancer). Investigating potential explanations for these links is an important next step. ADHD, while usefully conceptualized as a disorder in clinical practice, can be viewed as a trait. Recent genome-wide association study findings, consistent with twin studies, highlight that ADHD lies at the extreme end of a continuously distributed dimension, akin to hypertension along the continuum of blood pressure. Although ADHD levels typically decline with age, twin and molecular genetic studies suggest that a persistent trajectory is associated with higher genetic loading. Routine testing for rare mutations in ADHD is not yet recommended, although guidelines in many countries recommend testing individuals with mild intellectual disability or ASD, so practice could change. Common gene variants for ADHD are only weakly predictive and therefore have limited clinical value at present, as does pharmacogenomics.

In an effort to prevent potentially fatal adverse reactions to carbamazepine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert in 2007 containing pharmacogenomic information, which is still in effect today. The alert states that carbamazepine-induced skin reactions are significantly more common in patients with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*1502 allele and that these people are almost exclusively from 'broad areas of Asia, including South Asian Indians.' This study reviews the medical evidence relied upon by the FDA and finds that the alert does not accurately reflect the medical evidence relied upon in 2007 or evidence that has been generated over the last 5 years since the label was created. The FDA drug labeling should be modified to reflect current medical evidence.	260	264	ORGAN	skin
Increased awareness of the cardiovascular toxic effects of chemotherapy has led to the emergence of cardio-oncology (or onco-cardiology), which focuses on screening, monitoring and treatment of patients with cardiovascular dysfunctions resulting from chemotherapy. Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, and HER2 inhibitors, such as trastuzumab, both have cardiotoxic effects. The biological rationale, mechanisms of action and cardiotoxicity profiles of these two classes of drugs, however, are completely different, suggesting that cardiotoxic effects can occur in a range of different ways. Advances in genomics and proteomics have implicated several genomic variants and biological pathways that can influence the susceptibility to cardiotoxicity from these, and other drugs. Established pathways include multidrug resistance proteins, energy utilization pathways, oxidative stress, cytoskeletal regulation and apoptosis. Gene-expression profiles that have revealed perturbed pathways have vastly increased our knowledge of the complex processes involved in crosstalk between tumours and cardiac function. Utilization of mathematical and computational modelling can complement pharmacogenomics and improve individual patient outcomes. Such endeavours should enable identification of variations in cardiotoxicity, particularly in those patients who are at risk of not recovering, even with the institution of cardioprotective therapy. The application of systems biology holds substantial potential to advance our understanding of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.	1090	1097	ORGAN	cardiac

The target heart rate was defined as a resting heart rate < 70 beats/min. Clinical data were collected. <b>Results:</b> A total of 319 inpatients were enrolled in the study. The mutant allele frequencies of <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>ADRB1</i> were 57.21 and 69.44%, respectively. Whatever the dose of metoprolol, the heart rates were lower in patients with homozygous mutation of <i>CYP2D6</i> than those with heterozygous mutation and wild-type (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, this effect was not seen between different genotypes of <i>ADRB1</i>. Logistic regression analysis showed that the dose of metoprolol and the genotypes of <i>CYP2D6</i> were predictors of heart rate <70 beats/min in these patients. Further multivariate analysis indicated that patients with homozygous mutation had better control of heart rates compared with those with wild-type and heterozygous mutation of <i>CYP2D6*10</i> genotypes (all: p < 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b><i>CYP2D6*10</i> polymorphisms were associated with the heart rate of post-PCI patients treated with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets.	1465	1470	ORGAN	heart
Although trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity is an important determinant to limit the use of this drug, the molecular mechanism of risk for this toxicity is not well understood. To identify genetic variants determining the risk of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, we carried out whole exome sequencing of germline DNA samples from 9 patients with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, and conducted a case-control association study of 2258 genetic variants between 9 cases (with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity) and general Japanese population controls registered in the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD). The top variant which showed the lowest P-value in the screening study was rs139503277 in PHD Finger Protein 3 (P<sub>min</sub> = .00012, odds ratio [OR] = 51.23). To further validate the result of screening study, we carried out a replication study of 10 variants showing P<sub>min</sub> < .001 in the screening study using 234 independent patients treated with trastuzumab, including 10 cases and 224 controls (without trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity). In the replication study, we observed that three variants had an effect in the same direction as in the screening study (rs78272919 in exon 2 of Keratin 15, rs5762940 in exon 2 of zinc and ring finger 3, and rs139944387 in exon 44 of Eyes shut homologs [EYS]). A combined result of the screening and the replication studies suggested an association of a locus on chromosome 6q12 with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (rs139944387 in EYS, combined P<sub>min</sub> = .00056, OR = 13.73). This finding provides new insights into personalized trastuzumab therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancer.	1307	1311	ORGAN	Eyes
History suggests β agonists, the cognate ligand of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor, have been used as bronchodilators for around 5,000 years, and β agonists remain today the frontline treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The β agonists used clinically today are the products of significant expenditure and over 100 year's intensive research aimed at minimizing side effects and enhancing therapeutic usefulness. The respiratory physician now has a therapeutic toolbox of long acting β agonists to prophylactically manage bronchoconstriction, and short acting β agonists to relieve acute exacerbations. Despite constituting the cornerstone of asthma and COPD therapy, these drugs are not perfect; significant safety issues have led to a black box warning advising that long acting β agonists should not be used alone in patients with asthma. In addition there are a significant proportion of patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled. In this chapter we discuss the evolution of β agonist use and how the understanding of β agonist actions on their principal target tissue, airway smooth muscle, has led to greater understanding of how these drugs can be further modified and improved in the future. Research into the genetics of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor will also be discussed, as will the implications of individual DNA profiles on the clinical outcomes of β agonist use (pharmacogenetics). Finally we comment on what the future may hold for the use of β agonists in respiratory disease.	228	237	ORGAN	pulmonary
Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants' interindividual trough concentration variability affects efficacy and safety, especially in bleeding events. Rivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4/5-, CYP2J2-, and CYP-independent mechanisms and is a substrate of two transporter proteins: ABCB1 (MDR1, P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (BCRP; breast-cancer-resistance protein). The polymorphisms of these genes may possibly affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban and, consequently, its safety profile. Rivaroxaban variability may be associated with age, liver and kidney function, concomitant illness and therapy, and pharmacogenetic predisposition. This case series is the first, to our knowledge, that presents multiple risk factors for rivaroxaban-related bleeding (RRB) including age, renal function, concomitant diseases, concomitant treatment, and pharmacogenetic data. It presents patients with RRB, along with their complete clinical and pharmacogenetic data, as well as an evaluation of possible risk factors for RRB. Thirteen patients were carriers of <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>ABCG2</i>, <i>CYP2J2</i>, and/or <i>CYP3A4</i>/5 gene polymorphisms. Possible drug-drug interactions with increased bleeding risk were identified in nine patients. Six patients had eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Our data suggest a possible role of multiple factors and their interactions in predicting RRB; however, they also indicate the need for further comprehensive multidisciplinary research to enable safer use of this product based on a personalised approach.	546	551	ORGAN	liver

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are commonly used to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Endorsed by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and the European Society of Cardiology, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have displaced warfarin as the OAC of choice for both conditions, due to improved safety profiles, fewer drug-drug and drug-diet interactions, and lack of monitoring requirements. Despite their widespread use and improved safety over warfarin, DOAC-related bleeding remains a major concern for patients. DOACs have stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; however, variability in DOAC response is common and may be attributed to numerous factors, including patient-specific factors, concomitant medications, comorbid conditions, and genetics. Although DOAC randomized controlled trials included patients of varying ages and levels of kidney function, they failed to include patients of diverse ancestries. Additionally, current evidence to support DOAC pharmacogenetic associations have primarily been derived from European and Asian individuals. Given differences in genotype frequencies and disease burden among patients of different biogeographic groups, future research must engage diverse populations to assess and quantify the impact of predictors on DOAC response. Current under-representation of patients from diverse racial groups does not allow for proper generalization of the influence of clinical and genetic factors in relation to DOAC variability. Herein, we discuss factors affecting DOAC response, such as age, sex, weight, kidney function, drug interactions, and pharmacogenetics, while offering a new perspective on the need for further research including frequently excluded groups.	176	181	ORGAN	Heart

Behçet disease (BD) is an enigmatic inflammatory disorder with multisystemic complications which is endemic in some countries but can be seen in the entire world. Valid diagnostic criteria are available. The pathology is related to a specific perivasculitis with involvement of both arteries and veins of all sizes. Minor arterial and cardiac involvement is frequent in BD but is usually asymptomatic. In exceptional cases cardiac symptoms may be the 1st manifestation of BD. The prevalence of severe cardiac complications (cardio-Behçet) should be < 10%. An impressive therapeutic improvement has been achieved by using appropriate catheterization techniques, coronary and intra-arterial stents, colchicine, drug-response modifying drugs and immunotherapy but, still cardio-Behçet has a poor prognosis. Efforts are undertaken to improve morbidity and prognosis with the use of newer drugs. An important part of the complications in BD are related to the frequent thromboembolic complications and there is high possibility that newer oral anticoagulants will be superior to the classical anticoagulants presently used. Available biologic agents have already been frequently used and seem to have improved the prognosis, but efforts are undertaken to find newer biologic agents with better therapeutic performance and less side-effects. Summarizing as much as possible the effects of the presently used biotherapy in BD, interferon-alpha is effective against many ocular, genital and perhaps vascular manifestations, but its effectiveness is limited by frequent adverse-effects (even if not dangerous for the cardiovascular system). Infliximab is a valid option in the therapy of ocular and cutaneous manifestations but it is less convincing in the therapy of vascular manifestations in vascular- and neuro-Behçet; furthermore, side-effects, including severe cardiovascular complications, are seen in a minority of patients; perhaps worse, infliximab seems to loose efficacy in the long-term therapy, while pharmacogenetics and receptor polymorphism may explain the existence of non-responders and the occurrence of resistance. Adalimumab might be a promising alternative for infliximab and seems to exert a good effect in an eurysmatic and other vascular complications. However, we lack long-term studies. Other biologic agents have been used only in few cases and it is too early to say if they offer new therapeutic perspectives.	335	342	ORGAN	cardiac

Since the Human Genome Project, the evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of some medications has become partially connected to innate metabolic patterns. Thus, genes that encode receptors and enzymes could play different roles in metabolism, according to their polymorphisms. Especially in organ transplantation, some of the available medications used in immunosuppressive therapy have a narrow therapeutic index, affecting the individual response to these drugs. This review focuses on the polymorphism of genes that encode enzymes of the uridino-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family, responsible for the bioavailability of mycophenolic acid, the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), used as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation. The increasing literature data regarding the pharmacogenetics of UGT and MMF suggest that enzyme polymorphism can explain the factors which influence the occurrence of side effects in patients receiving MMF as drug transplant therapy.	296	301	ORGAN	organ
Thiopurines such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine are antimetabolites that have been used for several decades in the treatment of several diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases. Additional anti-inflammatory properties of these thiopurines have been discovered in recent years. Thiopurine metabolism is complex due to the involvement of multiple enzymes, of which the activities are genetically determined and cell type dependent. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes encoding these enzymes have been correlated with altered activities and drug intolerance. Detailed implications of these will be reviewed. Over the years several methods of therapeutic drug monitoring have been developed in an attempt to relate thiopurine drug availability with efficacy and intolerance. In this respect, monitoring pharmacologically active 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations is most widely used. So far, however, the clinical usefulness of these methods is hampered by methodological limitations. Some drug interactions may optimize the metabolization of thiopurines and consequently increase its efficacy and decrease drug intolerance. This review focuses on the clinical relevance and usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring of thiopurines and provides suggestions to optimize thiopurine therapy in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.	189	194	ORGAN	bowel

We systematically collected eligible data to measure the effect of CYP3A5*1 expression on personalized tacrolimus therapy. Six databases were searched for studies on adult liver transplant recipients and donors of liver graft which reported tacrolimus dose requirement, trough blood concentration, and/or concentration/dose (C/D) ratio in expressers and nonexpressers of CYP3A5*1. Eligible data were pooled by meta-analysis. Sixteen observational studies (1309 recipients, 1044 donors of liver graft) were included in the analyses. Tacrolimus C/D ratio was lower, and the dose was higher in recipient expressers of CYP3A5*1 and/or carriers of expresser liver graft at 1-4 weeks and 2-4, 6, and 12 months post-transplantation. Tacrolimus blood concentration was lower at the first two weeks. Pair expressers were affected by about twofold, and the effect was different between ethnic groups. CYP3A5*1 expression in recipients increased tacrolimus required dose by 0.023 at first, 0.022 at third, and 0.012 mg/kg/day at sixth month. Its expression in graft tissue increased tacrolimus required dose by 0.024 at first, 0.035 at third, and 0.032 mg/kg/day at sixth month. Considering CYP3A5*1 polymorphism can be helpful in individualization of tacrolimus efficient dose prior to administration, and it can remove initial high-risk lag time (over/underdose period before reaching target blood level) at first few days post-transplantation.	1383	1388	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active drug moiety of mycophenolate, is a potent immunosuppressant agent, which is increasingly being used in the treatment of patients with various autoimmune diseases. An understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate in this population should assist the clinician with rational dosage decisions. This review aims to provide an overview of the published literature on the clinical pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate in autoimmune disease and a briefer summary of current pharmacodynamic knowledge, and to identify areas of potential future research in this field. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE databases as well as bibliographies of relevant articles and 'on-line early' pages of key journals. Twenty-six pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies of mycophenolate in people with autoimmune disease were identified and appraised. Twenty-two of these studies used non-compartmental analysis techniques and four used population modelling methods to estimate mycophenolate pharmacokinetic parameters. Seven studies linked mycophenolate exposure to treatment outcomes. Only four studies measured free (unbound) as well as total mycophenolate exposure and only two studies characterised MPA disposition following enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) administration. Across all studies MPA displayed erratic and complex pharmacokinetics with substantial between-subject variability. Based on total drug measurement, the dose-normalised MPA area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 12 h post-dose (AUC12) varied at least five- to ten-fold between subjects. Typical values for apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of MPA during nonlinear mixed-effects modelling ranged from 8.3 to 25.3 L/h. Patient renal function, serum albumin levels, sex, ethnicity, food intake, concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as antacids, metal-containing medications and proton pump inhibitors and polymorphisms in genes encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase were identified in some studies as having a significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate. Typical MPA CL/F values in autoimmune disease patients were generally slightly lower than values published previously in population pharmacokinetic studies involving renal allograft recipients, possibly because of usage of ciclosporin, poorer renal function or lower serum albumin levels in the renal transplant cohort. In a single crossover study involving ten subjects only, significantly higher MPA AUC12 and maximum MPA concentration (C max) and lower MPA CL/F were reported following EC-MPS administration compared to mycophenolate mofetil administration. MPA exposure correlated well with treatment efficacy in patients with autoimmune disease (response to treatment, active disease and disease markers); however the relationship between MPA exposure and adverse events (infectious episodes, haematological toxicity and gastrointestinal symptoms) was unclear. Further investigation is required in autoimmune diseases such as chronic plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis and following EC-MPS administration. The extent of within-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate is largely unknown and potential covariate influences need to be confirmed in studies with large subject numbers. A relationship between MPA and MPA metabolite exposure and toxicity needs to be established. The contribution of pharmacogenetics to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate warrants further investigation, as does the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring. Dosing to achieve a target MPA AUC12 >35 mg·h/L is likely to lead to better efficacy outcomes in patients with autoimmune disease (rather than just giving standard doses, which lead to a wide range of exposures). However, the relationship between mycophenolate exposure and toxicity requires further investigation to determine the upper end of a target AUC range.	1541	1547	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma

However, the relationship between mycophenolate exposure and toxicity requires further investigation to determine the upper end of a target AUC range.	2442	2455	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum albumin
Genetic variants could aid in predicting antidiabetic drug response by associating them with markers of glucose control, such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). However, pharmacogenetic implementation for antidiabetics is still under development, as the list of actionable markers is being populated and validated. This study explores potential associations between genetic variants and plasma levels of HbA1c in 100 patients under treatment with metformin.	384	390	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma
Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies. The classical symptoms of FXIII deficiency span from intracranial haemorrhage to delay bleeding or the staying of chronic wounds in the skin including impaired mucosal healing. In this view, FXIII bridges primary haemostasis, coagulation and definite tissue healing. Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing. Accordingly, adequate FXIII levels can drive and predict the prognosis of complex diseases and the outcome of the associated therapies or interventions. In addition, peculiar pharmacogenetics aspects of the FXIII gene are of extraordinary interest. The present review accounts for the recognized role of FXIII in the healing process and gives some examples on how to use it as prognostic biological/ molecular marker or as potential tailored therapeutic molecule in complex diseases.	54	59	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Osteosarcoma is the malignant bone tumor most common in children and adolescents. Many cytochrome P-450 (CYP) members detoxify anticancer drugs used in osteosarcoma treatment, and thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate <i>CYP</i> polymorphisms in osteosarcoma patients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The present study investigated DNA from peripheral blood from 70 osteosarcoma patients treated with high doses of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. <i>CYP1A2*1F</i> (163C>A; rs762551); <i>CYP2C9*3</i> (1075A>C; rs1057910); and <i>CYP3A5*3</i> (6986A>G; rs776746) polymorphisms were investigated through real-time PCR using TaqMan probes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The <i>CYP2C9*3</i> allele did not present any association with clinical events. The <i>CYP1A2</i> CC/AC genotypes were associated with ototoxicity occurrence (<i>p</i> = 0.041, odds ratio [OR] = 8.4) and high grades of ototoxicity (<i>p</i> = 0.039, OR = 10.7), when compared with patients carrying the <i>CYP1A2</i> AA genotype. The <i>CYP1A2</i> CC genotype was associated with high grades of diarrhea (<i>p</i> = 0.043, OR = 4.6) and fever (<i>p</i> = 0.041, OR = 7.1) in comparison with the <i>CYP1A2</i> AA/AC genotypes. The <i>CYP3A5</i> CC genotype was associated with weight loss (<i>p</i> = 0.009, OR = 3.8) and high grades of hepatotoxicity (<i>p</i> = 0.010, OR = 4.3) when compared with the <i>CYP3A5</i> TT/CT genotypes. The <i>CYP3A5</i> CC/CT genotypes were associated with high grades of vomit (<i>p</i> = 0.013, OR = 10.8), pulmonary relapse absence (<i>p</i> = 0.029, OR = 9.5), and better overall and event-free survivals (<i>p</i> = 0.017, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.1; <i>p</i> = 0.044, HR = 2.5; respectively) when compared with the <i>CYP3A5</i> AA genotype. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b><i>CYP1A2*1A</i> and <i>CYP3A5*3</i> alleles were associated with toxicity events. <i>CYP3A5*3</i> allele was associated with better survival. Thus, <i>CYP</i> genotypes might be promising markers to tailoring treatment in osteosarcoma patients.	371	387	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	peripheral blood
As part of substance use maintenance programs, individuals are monitored for sobriety through urine drug screens. A positive screen, and its confirmation and interpretation, can have devastating consequences, sometimes even leading to termination from the program and relapse. Naltrexone metabolism involves several steps and metabolites - one minor metabolite with very little mention in medical literature being noroxymorphone. This is also the final intermediate in the metabolic pathway of oxycodone; hence, detection is naturally presumed by clinicians to be attributed to oxycodone use. Through this case report, we alert clinicians that, depending on individual pharmacogenomics, it is possible to obtain a positive confirmation of this component alone (without any oxycodone pathway intermediates) with naltrexone administration.	94	99	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	urine
Hypertension is a prevalent public health problem, contributing to >10 million deaths annually. Though multiple therapeutics exist, many patients suffer from treatment-resistant hypertension or try several medications before achieving blood pressure control. Genomic advances offer mechanistic understanding of blood pressure variability, therapeutic targets, therapeutic response, and promise a stratified approach to treatment of primary hypertension. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate augmentation, aldosterone synthase inhibitors, and angiotensinogen blockade with silencing RNA and antisense therapies are among the promising novel approaches. Pharmacogenomic studies have also been done to explore the genetic bases underpinning interindividual variability in response to existing therapeutics. A polygenic approach using risk scores is likely to be the next frontier in stratifying responses to existing therapeutics.	235	240	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood

The advent of anti-TNF agents as the first approved targeted therapy in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients has made a major impact on our existing therapeutic algorithms. They have not only been approved for induction and maintenance treatment in IBD patients, but have also enabled us to define and achieve novel therapeutic outcomes, such as combination of clinical symptom control and endoscopic remission, as well as mucosal healing. Nevertheless, approximately one third of treated patients do not respond to initiated anti-TNF therapy and these treatments are associated with sometimes severe systemic side-effects. There is therefore the currently unmet clinical need do establish predictive markers of response to identify the subgroup of IBD patients, that have a heightened probability of response. There have so far been approaches from different fields of IBD research, to descry markers that would empower us to apply TNF-inhibitors in a more rational manner. These markers encompass findings from disease-related and clinical factors, pharmacokinetics, biochemical markers, blood and stool derived parameters, pharmacogenomics, microbial species, metabolic compounds, and mucosal factors. Furthermore, changes in the intestinal immune cell composition in response to therapeutic pressure of anti-TNF treatment have recently been implicated in the process of molecular resistance to these drugs. Insights into factors that determine resistance to anti-TNF therapy give reasonable hope, that a more targeted approach can then be utilized in these non-responders. Here, IL-23 could be identified as one of the key factors determining resistance to TNF-inhibitors. Growing insights into the molecular mechanism of action of TNF-inhibitors might also enable us to derive critical molecular markers that not only mediate the clinical effects of anti-TNF therapy, but which level of expression might also correlate with its therapeutic efficacy. In this narrative review, we present an overview of currently identified possible predictive markers for successful anti-TNF therapy and discuss identified molecular pathways that drive resistance to these substances. We will also point out the necessity and difficulty of developing and validating a diagnostic marker concerning clinically relevant outcome parameters, before they can finally enter daily clinical practice and enable a more personalized therapeutic approach.	1112	1117	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
Numerous investigations on metabolic enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP) have been conducted since 1990. In the psychiatric field, CYP2D6, which is a major enzyme involved in the metabolism of antidepressants and antipsychotics, has been focused on. Poor metabolizers (deficit metabolizers) for CYP2D6 are 7% in Caucasians, while they are less than 1% in Asians. Frequency of a mutated allele for CYP2D6*10, which leads to a decrease in CYP2D6 activity, is 40% in Asians. It has been reported that the steady-state plasma concentration of haloperidol in subjects with mutated alleles for CYP2D6 is significantly higher than that in subjects without mutated alleles. On the other hand, the steady-state plasma concentration of risperidone is very different between CYP2D6 genotypes. Recently receptor polymorphism has been studied and an association between clinical response and polymorphism of dopamine and serotonin has been reported. In the dopamine D2, subjects with -141C Ins allele in -141C Ins/Del polymorphism and subjects with A1 allele in Taq 1A have better response to dopamine antagonists. Clinical pharmacogenetical studies from both a phamacokinetical and a pharmacogynamical point of view are required in order to introduce and practice individualized medicine in the psychiatric field easily.	510	516	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma

The focus of treating an individual patient is the identification of the individual's specific needs. The measurement of the patient's characteristics, such as blood pressure or body temperature, and also the measurement of biomarkers, such as cholesterol or hemoglobin A1C is part of the patient's health assessment. The deeper the insights into the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of the patient, the better we are positioned to treat a patient. Increasingly, this assessment includes testing for certain pharmacologically relevant genetic variations (pharmacogenetics). Evaluating how the patient's genetic makeup combined with the patient's exposure to environmental influences could impact disease and treatment decisions is becoming the cornerstone of personalized medicine. However, we often use such assessments for finding the most 'effective' treatment, but we might not always be as rigorous in our assessment of potential safety risks. This is particularly apparent when looking at how safety risks are communicated. Often this information is only available as general, population-based statements and a small amount of information is available to evaluate whether or not an individual patient is at risk. Although pharmacogenetic tests that can help to assess whether an individual patient's personal risk exist (safety pharmacogenetics), they are not always performed.	160	165	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
DNA biosensors are attractive tools for genetic analysis as there is an increasing need for rapid and low-cost DNA analysis, primarily driven by applications in personalized pharmacogenomics, clinical diagnostics, rapid pathogen detection, food traceability and forensics. A rapid electrochemical genosensor detection methodology exploiting a combination of modified primers for solution-phase isothermal amplification, followed by rapid detection via hybridization on gold electrodes is reported. Modified reverse primers, exploiting a C18 spacer between the primer-binding site and an engineered single stranded tail, are used in a recombinase polymerase amplification reaction to produce an amplicon with a central duplex flanked by two single stranded tails. These tails are designed to be complementary to a gold electrode tethered capture oligo probe as well as a horseradish peroxidase labelled reporter oligo probe. The time required for hybridization of the isothermally generated amplicons with each of the immobilized and reporter probes was optimised to be 2 min, in both cases. The effect of amplification time and the limit of detection were evaluated using these hybridization times for both single stranded and double stranded DNA templates. The best detection limit of 70 fM for a ssDNA template was achieved using 45 min amplification, whilst for a dsDNA template, just 30 min amplification resulted in a slightly lower detection limit of 14 fM, whilst both 20 and 45 min amplification times were observed to provide detection limits of 71 and 72 fM, respectively, but 30 and 45 min amplification resulted in a much higher signal and sensitivity. The genosensor was applied to genomic DNA and real patient and control blood samples for detection of the coeliac disease associated DQB1*02 HLA allele, as a model system, demonstrating the possibility to carry out molecular diagnostics, combining amplification and detection in a rapid and facile manner.	1736	1741	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
Venous thrombosis (VT) is a highly prevalent disease. Risk factors can be genetic or acquired. The well-established genetic polymorphisms predisposing to thrombophilic disorders can be divided into rare 'loss-of-function mutations' in anticoagulant proteins and common 'gain-of-function mutations' in procoagulant proteins, which are weaker risk factors. In addition to functional polymorphisms, defects in common pathways affecting biosynthesis or clearance of plasma coagulation factors and their relations to VT risk have been detected. Recently, investigations regarding genetic variations and response to drug treatment, relevant for the pathogenesis as well as therapy of venous thromboembolism have been performed. The methodical advances in genetic research have led to the identification of a number of new variants with still unclear association to VT. This review aims to discuss the established genetic risk factors as well as some candidate predictors of VT. Further, the recent developments in pharmacogenomics are reviewed.	462	468	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma
The pharmacokinetics of the atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, display large interindividual variation leading to multiple-fold differences in drug exposure between patients at a given dose. This variation in turn gives rise to the need for individualized dosing in order to avoid concentration-dependent adverse effects or therapeutic failure. Genetically determined differences in olanzapine metabolism represent a less studied source of variability in comparison to environmental and physiological factors. In this review, we summarize available in vitro and in vivo data addressing the influence of polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes on olanzapine serum exposure. The polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme appears to have no significant influence on olanzapine steady-state serum concentrations. The formation of the various olanzapine metabolites is influenced by polymorphisms in the genes coding for CYP1A2, CYP1A expression regulator AHR, UGT1A4 and UGT2B10, as well as FMO3. An impact on steady-state olanzapine serum concentrations has been suggested for variants of CYP1A2 and UGT1A4, with somewhat conflicting findings. The potential involvement of FMO1 and CYP3A43 in olanzapine disposition has also been suggested but needs future validation.	661	666	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum

Hypertension is a complex, multifactorial disease; genetic factors represent one third to half of the inter-individual variability of blood pressure values. Among the causes of secondary hypertension are a group of disorders with a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Recent advances in molecular biology have revealed the pathogenesis of hypertension in many of these conditions. Remarkably, the mechanism in every case has proved to be upregulation of sodium Na reabsorption in the distal nephron, with accompanying expansion of extracellular volume. On the contrary in the essential hypertension the underlying pathogenetic mechanism is more complex because of interplay between several 'risk' genes and environmental factors. It is assumed that blood pressure is under the control of a large number of genes each of which has only relatively mild effects. It has therefore been difficult to discover the genes that contribute to blood pressure variation using traditional approaches including candidate gene studies and linkage studies. Recent development of genotyping technology made large scale genome-wide association studies possible. This approach and the study of monogenic forms of hypertension has led to the discovery of novel and robust candidate genes for human essential hypertension, many of which require functional analysis in experimental models. This review summarizes the current findings for candidate genes associated with blood pressure and focuses on recent advances and future potential of pharmacogenetics of hypertension, with the intent to clarify what amount of these investments in basic science research will be delivered into benefits to patients.	134	139	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood

<b>Introduction</b>: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the second most common cancer globally. The mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) proto-oncogene can be targeted in NSCLC patients. <b>Methods</b>: We performed a literature search on PubMed in December 2019 for studies on MET inhibitors and NSCLC. Phase II and III clinical trials published in English between 2014 and 2019 were selected. <b>Results</b>: Data on MET inhibitors (tivantinib, cabozantinib, and crizotinib) and anti-MET antibodies (emibetuzumab and onartuzumab) are reported in the text. <b>Conclusion</b>: Emibetuzumab could be used for NSCLC cases with high <i>MET</i> expression. Further, studies on onartuzumab failed to prove its efficacy, while the results of tivantinib trials were clinically but not statistically significant. Additionally, cabozantinib was effective, but adverse reactions were common, and crizotinib was generally well-tolerated.	583	595	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	Emibetuzumab
Monitoring and treating iron overload is crucial in transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients. Liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography and T2* magnetic resonance imaging represent non-invasive ways to evaluate the adequacy of the iron chelation treatment. We explored the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in vitamin D metabolism, transport and activity, and in deferasirox metabolism on liver iron burden parameters. One-hundred and five beta-thalassaemia patients, treated with deferasirox, have been enrolled. Drug plasma C<sub>trough</sub> and AUC were measured by a HPLC-UV method. Allelic discrimination was performed by real-time PCR. Age, UGT1A1-364 CT/TT and CYP27B1 -1260 GT/TT positively predicted liver stiffness values. Deferasirox dose and serum ferritin negatively predicted T2* data, whereas age and CYP2D6 1457 GG genotype positively influenced these values. The discoveries of this research may be useful for personalized medicine and the proposed method could be applied in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and myelodysplastic syndromes.	549	557	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma C

<b>Introduction</b>: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is an adverse effect of several classes of chemotherapy including the taxanes. Predictive PN biomarkers could inform individualized taxane treatment to reduce PN and enhance therapeutic outcomes. Pharmacogenetics studies of taxane-induced PN have focused on genes involved in pharmacokinetics, including enzymes and transporters. Contradictory findings from these studies prevent translation of genetic biomarkers into clinical practice. <b>Areas covered</b>: This review discusses the progress toward identifying pharmacogenetic predictors of PN by assessing the evidence for two independent associations; the effect of pharmacogenetics on taxane pharmacokinetics and the evidence that taxane pharmacokinetics affects PN. Assessing these direct relationships allows the reader to understand the progress toward individualized taxane treatment and future research opportunities. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics is a major determinant of PN. Additional clinical trials are needed to confirm the clinical benefit of individualized dosing to achieve target paclitaxel exposure. Genetics does not meaningfully contribute to paclitaxel pharmacokinetics and may not be useful to inform dosing. However, genetics may contribute to PN sensitivity and could be useful for estimating patients' optimal paclitaxel exposure. For docetaxel, genetics has not been demonstrated to have a meaningful effect on pharmacokinetics and there is no evidence that pharmacokinetics determines PN.	21	31	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	Peripheral
Efavirenz (EFV) is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor commonly used as first-line therapy in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with a narrow therapeutic range and a high between-subject variability which can lead to central nervous system toxicity or therapeutic failure. To characterize the sources of variability and better predict EFV steady-state plasma concentrations, a population pharmacokinetic model was developed from 96 HIV-positive individuals, using a nonlinear mixed-effect method with Monolix® software. A one-compartment with first-order absorption and elimination model adequately described the data. To explain between-subject variability, demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters, hepatitis C virus-HIV coinfection, and genetic polymorphisms were tested. A combination of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs2279343 and rs3745274, both in the CYP2B6 gene, were the only covariates influencing clearance, included in the final model. Oral clearance was estimated to be 19.6 L/h, 14.15 L/h, and 6.08 L/h for wild-type, heterozygous mutated and homozygous mutated individuals, respectively. These results are in accordance with the current knowledge of EFV metabolism and also suggest that in homozygous mutated individuals, a dose adjustment is necessary. Hepatitis C virus-HIV coinfection does not seem to be a predictive indicator of EFV pharmacokinetic disposition.	383	389	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma
The 21st century has witnessed the discovery of multiple rare and common gene variants associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and these discoveries have already provided a starting point for the investigation of the biology of the disorder and novel treatments. The purpose of this selective review is to examine genetic findings from the past 5 years and consider their implications for the conceptualization of ADHD and future clinical practice. Recent discoveries reveal the strong genetic overlaps between ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as intellectual disability. Thus, the removal of the previous diagnostic exclusion criteria for ADHD in the presence of ASD is a welcome change in DSM-5. However, ADHD also shows substantial genetic correlations with a much broader group of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as with nonpsychiatric conditions (e.g., lung cancer). Investigating potential explanations for these links is an important next step. ADHD, while usefully conceptualized as a disorder in clinical practice, can be viewed as a trait. Recent genome-wide association study findings, consistent with twin studies, highlight that ADHD lies at the extreme end of a continuously distributed dimension, akin to hypertension along the continuum of blood pressure. Although ADHD levels typically decline with age, twin and molecular genetic studies suggest that a persistent trajectory is associated with higher genetic loading. Routine testing for rare mutations in ADHD is not yet recommended, although guidelines in many countries recommend testing individuals with mild intellectual disability or ASD, so practice could change. Common gene variants for ADHD are only weakly predictive and therefore have limited clinical value at present, as does pharmacogenomics.

Data variability is a costly complication of biomedical experimentation because the same experiment must be repeated a sufficient number of times so that the sample mean becomes a credible representation of the entire population. Since sampling is ideally done randomly in populations normalized for environmental and genetic backgrounds, data variability is viewed as a purely statistical issue reflecting the distribution in the population and captured as the standard deviation of the sampled data. The factors contributing to data variability are not analyzed by statistical methods; for want of a better explanation, data scatter is simply attributed to random noise and/or methodological limitations. In this commentary, evidence is discussed that documents an important role of interindividual biological diversity as a cause for data variability based on studies in which repeated sampling in the same individual permitted statistical comparisons between individuals in the same sample. Significant differences were found for proximal fluid reabsorption and plasma renin concentration between sample means of individuals of the same population. Furthermore, arterial blood pressure varied significantly between individual mice independently of strain and sex. Recognition of the extent of interindividual variability has important implications for data reproducibility, data collection, and data presentation in physiological research. Such nonrandom data variability may have different causes, but DNA modifications by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms could generate phenotype variants without being associated with disease symptoms. Exploration of the heritability of phenotypical diversity in physiology may be defined as "physiogenetics," and it would thus be the physiological corollary of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics.	1066	1078	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma renin
Due to interindividual variability in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, traditional isoniazid fixed-dose regimens may lead to suboptimal or toxic isoniazid concentrations in the plasma of patients with tuberculosis, contributing to adverse drug reactions, therapeutic failure, or the development of drug resistance. Achieving precision therapy for isoniazid requires a multifaceted approach that could integrate various clinical and genomic factors to tailor the isoniazid dose to individual patient characteristics. This includes leveraging molecular diagnostics to perform the comprehensive profiling of host pharmacogenomics to determine how it affects isoniazid metabolism, such as its metabolism by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), and studying drug-resistant mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome for enabling targeted therapy selection. Several other molecular signatures identified from the host pharmacogenomics as well as other omics-based approaches such as gut microbiome, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic approaches have provided mechanistic explanations for isoniazid pharmacokinetic variability and/or adverse drug reactions and thereby may facilitate precision therapy of isoniazid, though further validations in larger and diverse populations with tuberculosis are required for clinical applications. Therapeutic drug monitoring and population pharmacokinetic approaches allow for the adjustment of isoniazid dosages based on patient-specific pharmacokinetic profiles, optimizing drug exposure while minimizing toxicity and the risk of resistance. Current evidence has shown that with the integration of the host pharmacogenomics-particularly NAT2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomics data along with isoniazid pharmacokinetic concentrations in the blood and patient factors such as anthropometric measurements, comorbidities, and type and timing of food administered-precision therapy approaches in isoniazid therapy can be tailored to the specific characteristics of both the host and the pathogen for improving tuberculosis treatment outcomes.	182	188	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma

Liraglutide is a long-acting human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue and an effective treatment for patients with metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. This review focuses on the mechanism of action of liraglutide as a well-known glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in patients with T2DM and obesity. The lower and the higher doses of GLP-1 RAs are used for glycaemic control in T2DM and in obesity respectively. GLP-1 RAs such as liraglutide enhance insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon release via the stimulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs). Liraglutide decreases hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients when prescribes as monotherapy or in combination with one or more antidiabetic drugs. Usually, it is well tolerated with minor hypoglycemia in combination therapy. Liraglutide reduces cardiovascular events and related risk factors including improvement of lipid profile and control of blood pressure. Accordingly, it can be cost-effective and may be a budget neutral medication option by considering its protective effect on the cardiovascular system in long-term use in the health care plan. In the near future, by pharmacogenomics approach, prediction of the highest patient's response with the lowest adverse drug reactions and also rationality of drug development will be possible. Liraglutide can be used as a desirable medicine for glycemic control and obesity. It shows extensive evidence based benefits in diabetes complications. In this narrative review, we have summarized and evaluated studies related to the role of liraglutide in clinical practice.	989	994	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
The nucleus accumbens is a critical mediator of depression-related outcomes to social defeat stress. Previous studies demonstrate distinct neuroplasticity adaptations in the two medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, those enriched in dopamine receptor D1 versus dopamine receptor D2, in reward and reinforcement leading to opposing roles for these MSNs in these behaviors. However, the distinct roles of nucleus accumbens MSN subtypes, in depression, remain poorly understood.	402	423	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	nucleus accumbens MSN
The heritability of hypertension (HTN) is widely recognized and as a result, extensive studies ranging from genetic linkage analyses to genome-wide association studies are actively ongoing to elucidate the etiology of both monogenic and polygenic forms of HTN. Due to the complex nature of essential HTN, however, single genes affecting blood pressure (BP) variability remain difficult to isolate and identify and have rendered the development of single-gene targeted therapies challenging. The roles of other causative factors in modulating BP, such as gene-environment interactions and epigenetic factors, are increasingly being brought to the forefront. In this review, we discuss the various monogenic HTN syndromes and corresponding pathophysiologic mechanisms, the different methodologies employed in genetic studies of essential HTN, the mechanisms for epigenetic modulation of essential HTN, pharmacogenomics and HTN, and finally, recent advances in genetic studies of essential HTN in the pediatric population.	337	342	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
Kidney transplantation requires lifelong immunosuppression with agents that prevent allograft rejection. Immunosuppressive regimens typically include a steroid, an immune modulator (eg, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or mycophenolate sodium), and a calcineurin inhibitor, either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Tacrolimus is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 in both the liver and small intestine. Drugs that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4, as well as inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4, can cause significant interactions with tacrolimus. A review of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus is important to enhance practitioners' understanding when using tacrolimus after kidney transplantation. It is also important to educate patients and their families about tacrolimus. Patients' adherence to this medication regimen is pivotal for allograft survival. A consistent and comprehensive approach to education and discharge teaching is a key component of adherence and the attainment of therapeutic drug levels. At Shands Jacksonville Transplant Center, discharge education and teaching tools aid the transplant professionals and facilitate patients' adherence. This in turn supports the goals of maintaining therapeutic serum levels of tacrolimus and improving renal allograft survival.	1259	1264	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum
In advanced renal cell carcinoma, a transition of drug therapies from cytokines to molecular-targeted drugs and immune-oncology drugs provides more clinical benefits to patients, while adequate management is required for various and sometimes serious adverse events. At present, the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of many drugs and their effectiveness or adverse events has been elucidated, and therapeutic drug monitoring is being applied to some immunosuppressive, anti-epileptic and antibacterial drugs in daily clinical practice. Most of the molecular-targeted drugs used in patients with renal cell carcinoma are orally active, and are affected by absorption and disposition, which can be different for each individual. The monitoring of the circulating drug concentration could be beneficial to patients by providing information for the adjustment of drug dose and the maintenance of a therapeutic plasma concentration range. Genetic polymorphisms are known to be involved in pharmacokinetics, and cause individual differences in clinical efficacy and adverse events. Therefore, a more scientific strategy should be used in regard to the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with molecular-targeted drugs by accumulating evidence on pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics.	915	921	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma
Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) encoded by orosomucoid genes (ORM1 and ORM2) is an acute-phase response protein and functions as a drug-binding protein that affects pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics of binding drugs. To explore the effects of genetic variations of ORMs and a role of AGP on paclitaxel (PTX) therapy, we analyzed the duplication and genetic variations/haplotypes of ORMs in 165 Japanese cancer patients and then investigated their associations with serum AGP levels and the PK parameters of PTX. No effects of ORM duplications on serum AGP levels at baseline or PK of PTX were observed, but close associations of ORM1 -559T > A with the increases of AGP levels and area under the curve (AUC) of PTX metabolites were detected. In addition, a significant correlation between the serum AGP level and the AUCs of PTX metabolites was observed, suggesting that AGP may function as a carrier of PTX from the blood into the liver via putative receptors. This study provided useful information on the possible clinical importance of ORM genetic polymorphisms and a novel role of AGP in PTX therapy.	470	479	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum AGP

Thiazide (TZD) diuretics are among the most commonly prescribed antihypertensives globally; however their chronic blood pressure (BP) lowering mechanism remains unclear. Herein we discuss the current evidence regarding specific mechanisms regulating the antihypertensive effects of TZDs, suggesting that TZDs act via multiple complex and interacting mechanisms, including natriuresis with short term use and direct vasodilatory effects chronically. Additionally, we review pharmacogenomics signals that have been associated with TZDs BP-response in several cohorts (i.e. NEDD4L, PRKCA, EDNRA-GNAS, and YEATS4) and discuss how these genes might be related to TZD BP-response mechanism. Understanding the association between these genes and TZD BP mechanism might facilitate the development of new drugs and therapeutic approaches based on a deeper understanding of the determinants of BP-response.	114	119	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
Two independent lines of High Drinking in the Dark (HDID-1, HDID-2) mice have been bred to reach high blood alcohol levels after a short period of binge-like ethanol drinking. Male mice of both lines were shown to have reduced sensitivity to develop a taste aversion to a novel flavor conditioned by ethanol injections as compared with their unselected HS/NPT founder stock. We have subsequently developed inbred variants of each line. The current experiments established that reduced ethanol-conditioned taste aversion is also seen in the inbred variants, in both males and females. In other experiments, we asked whether HDID mice would ingest sufficient doses of ethanol to lead to a conditioned taste aversion upon retest. Different manipulations were used to elevate consumption of ethanol on initial exposure. Access to increased ethanol concentrations, to multiple tubes of ethanol, and fluid restriction to increase thirst motivation all enhanced initial drinking of ethanol. Each condition led to reduced intake the next day, consistent with a mild conditioned taste aversion. These experiments support the conclusion that one reason contributing to the willingness of HDID mice to drink to the point of intoxication is a genetic insensitivity to the aversive effects of ethanol.	102	115	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood alcohol
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Essential hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of other cardiovascular diseases and is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors, with up to 50% of blood pressure variance currently attributed to an individual's genetic makeup. By studying genes that cause monogenic forms of hypertension and pathways relevant to blood pressure control, a number of polymorphisms have been identified that increase an individual's risk of developing high blood pressure. We report on candidate gene association studies and genome-wide association studies that have been performed to date in the field of hypertension research. It is becoming clear that for the majority of people there is no single gene polymorphism that causes hypertension, but rather a number of common genetic variants, each having a small effect. Using pharmacogenomics to personalize the treatment of hypertension holds promise for achieving and sustaining normotensive pressures quickly, while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions and unwanted side-effects. This will decrease the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in individuals and lead to a reduced burden of disease upon society as a whole.	252	257	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood

Pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing is commonly utilized to predict a patient's response to medications based on the presence of genetic variants. However, certain conditions have been associated with potentially inaccurate PGx results. The majority of medications are predominantly metabolized in the liver; therefore, in the case of liver transplantation, PGx results may be misinterpreted in the context of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Other instances of ambiguous PGx results have been reported in the literature in conditions such as allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute or chronic myeloid leukemia and blood transfusion. In order to prevent potential inaccuracies in PGx testing, Sanford Imagenetics developed an active, interruptive alert to inform providers of the potential for inaccurate PGx results.	648	653	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood

The associations between plasma letrozole concentrations and CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genetic variants were tested in the Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenomics (ELPH) trial. ELPH is a multicenter, open-label prospective clinical trial in women randomly assigned (n≈250 in each arm) to receive 2 years of treatment with either oral letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or oral exemestane (25 mg/day). CYP2A6 and CYP3A showed effects on letrozole metabolism in vitro. DNA samples were genotyped for variants in the CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genes. Plasma letrozole concentrations showed high interpatient variability (>10-fold) and were associated significantly with CYP2A6 genotypes (P<0.0001), body mass index (BMI) (P<0.0001), and age (P=0.0035). However, CYP3A5 genotypes showed no association with plasma letrozole concentrations. These data suggest that CYP2A6 is the principal clearance mechanism for letrozole in vivo. CYP2A6 metabolic status, along with BMI and age, may serve as a biomarker of the efficacy of letrozole treatment or a predictor of adverse effects.	25	41	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma letrozole

Warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant, but large interindividual variations exist in the dose required to achieve comparable therapeutic effects. Several clinical and genetic variables have been identified that influence warfarin dosing. However, interactions between genotype and nutrition remain uncertain in terms of dietary vitamin K intake. To investigate genotype-nutrient interactions in warfarin anticoagulation therapy, 202 consecutive outpatients (M/F = 142/60, mean age, 69 years) undergoing treatment with warfarin were enrolled. Prevalent single nucleotide polymorphisms in VKORC1 and CYP2C9 were genotyped, and dietary vitamin K intake during the week preceding the blood sampling was quantitatively estimated by a dietitian-assisted questionnaire. Patients were classified according to low, medium, or high vitamin K intake. The mean daily warfarin dose in subjects with a VKORC1-1639 A/A genotype was significantly smaller than that with a -1639A/G genotype (2.74 vs. 3.91 mg/day, respectively, p < 0.0001). Dose requirements did not differ between subjects with a CYP2C9 *1/*3 genotype versus a CYP2C9 *1/*1 genotype. In subjects with a variant VKORC1-1639 G allele, the mean daily warfarin dose was significantly attenuated by low vitamin K intake compared with medium and high intake after adjustment for covariates (3.4 vs. 5.0 vs. 4.0 mg/day, respectively, p = 0.028). No such genotype effects were observed in homozygous patients for the VKORC1-1639 A allele. The results of the present study suggest that the capacity of dietary vitamin K intake to influence warfarin dose requirements during anticoagulation therapy is VKORC1 genotype-dependent, at least in part.	700	705	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
Pharmacogenetics has often been touted as a cornerstone for precision medicine as detailed knowledge of a specific genetic makeup may allow for accurate predictions of a patient's individual drug response. Still, the widespread use of genetic tests is limited as they remain expensive and cumbersome, requiring sophisticated tools and highly trained personnel. In order for pharmacogenetics to reach its full potential, more cost-effective and easily accessible genotyping methods are desired. To meet these challenges, we present a silicon-based integrated microsystem for the detection of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) directly from human blood. The device combines a blood lysis chamber, a cross-flow filter, a T-junction mixer, and a microreactor for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Using this device, successful on-chip genotyping of two clinically relevant SNPs in human CYP2C9 gene was demonstrated with TaqMan assays, starting from blood. The two SNPs were detected simultaneously by introducing a sequence of plugs, each containing a different set of primers and probes. The method can be easily extended to detect several SNPs. The microsystem described here offers a rapid, reproducible, and accurate sample-to-answer technology enabling multiplex SNP profiling in point-of-care settings, bringing pharmacogenetics-based precision medicine a step closer to reality.	688	693	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood

The biological fingerprint of environmental adversity may be key to understanding health and disease, as it encompasses the damage induced as well as the compensatory reactions of the organism. Metabolic and hormonal changes may be an informative but incomplete window into the underlying biology. We endeavored to identify objective blood gene expression biomarkers for psychological stress, a subjective sensation with biological roots. To quantify the stress perception at a particular moment in time, we used a simple visual analog scale for life stress in psychiatric patients, a high-risk group. Then, using a stepwise discovery, prioritization, validation, and testing in independent cohort design, we were successful in identifying gene expression biomarkers that were predictive of high-stress states and of future psychiatric hospitalizations related to stress, more so when personalized by gender and diagnosis. One of the top biomarkers that survived discovery, prioritization, validation, and testing was FKBP5, a well-known gene involved in stress response, which serves as a de facto reassuring positive control. We also compared our biomarker findings with telomere length (TL), another well-established biological marker of psychological stress and show that newly identified predictive biomarkers such as NUB1, APOL3, MAD1L1, or NKTR are comparable or better state or trait predictors of stress than TL or FKBP5. Over half of the top predictive biomarkers for stress also had prior evidence of involvement in suicide, and the majority of them had evidence in other psychiatric disorders, providing a molecular underpinning for the effects of stress in those disorders. Some of the biomarkers are targets of existing drugs, of potential utility in patient stratification, and pharmacogenomics approaches. Based on our studies and analyses, the biomarkers with the best overall convergent functional evidence (CFE) for involvement in stress were FKBP5, DDX6, B2M, LAIR1, RTN4, and NUB1. Moreover, the biomarker gene expression signatures yielded leads for possible new drug candidates and natural compounds upon bioinformatics drug repurposing analyses, such as calcium folinate and betulin. Our work may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment for stress disorders such as PTSD, that result in decreased quality of life and adverse outcomes, including addictions, violence, and suicide.	334	339	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
The detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is of increasing importance in many areas including clinical diagnostics, patient stratification for pharmacogenomics, and advanced forensic analysis. In the work reported, we apply a semiautomated system for solid-phase electrochemical melting curve analysis (éMCA) for the identification of the allele present at a specific SNP site associated with an increased risk of bone fracture and predisposition to osteoporosis. Asymmetric isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification using ferrocene labeled forward primers was employed to generate single stranded redox labeled amplicons. In a first approach to demonstrate the proof of concept of combining asymmetric RPA with solid-phase éMCA, a simplified system housing a multielectrode array within a polymeric microsystem, sandwiched between two aluminum plates of a heater device, was used. Sample manipulation through the microfluidic channel was controlled by a syringe pump, and an external Ag/AgCl reference electrode was employed. Individual electrodes of the array were functionalized with four different oligonucleotide probes, each probe equivalent in design with the exception of the middle nucleotide. The isothermally generated amplicons were allowed to hybridize to the surface-tethered probes and subsequently subjected to a controlled temperature ramp, and the melting of the duplex was monitored electrochemically. A clear difference between the fully complementary and a single mismatch was observed. Having demonstrated the proof-of-concept, a device for automated éMCA with increased flexibility to house diverse electrode arrays with internal quasi-gold reference electrodes, higher resolution, and broader melting temperature range was developed and exploited for the detection of SNP hetero/homozygosity. Using the optimized conditions, the system was applied to the identification of the allele present at an osteoporosis associated SNP site, rs2741856, in 10 real fingerprick/venous blood samples, with results validated using Sanger sequencing.	2017	2022	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
No pharmacogenetic studies have yet been conducted in community pharmacies, despite pharmacogenetics being an emerging discipline. Pharmacotherapeutic follow-up (PFU) was performed for 6 months in 37 patients receiving antihypertensive treatment, and they were genotyped for variant alleles *2 and *3 in the CYP2C9 gene and *1B in CYP3A4. Systolic blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, and adherence improved with PFU. Most of the interactions between drugs were represented by concurrent administration of statins and calcium channel blockers, which both use CYP3A4 for their metabolism. Heterozygotic patients for the CYP2C9*2 allele showed higher mean heart rate values after PFU than homozygous patients (73.4 ± 10.0 pulse/min vs 66.2 ± 10.6 pulse/min, respectively; P = .048). Carriers of CYP2C9*2 showed a tendency to less frequent negative outcomes associated with medication due to inefficacy than homozygous patients (50% vs 78.9%, respectively; P = .072). Pharmacogenetics and PFU can be used in community pharmacies to carry out a more exhaustive study of medication in hypertensive outpatients.	348	353	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
Antipsychotic medications (APs), particularly second-generation APs, are associated with significant weight gain in schizophrenia patients. Recent evidence suggests that the immune system may contribute to antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) via AP-mediated alterations of cytokine levels. Antipsychotics with a high propensity for weight gain, such as clozapine and olanzapine, influence the expression of immune genes, and induce changes in serum cytokine levels to ultimately down-regulate neuroinflammation. Since inflammatory cytokines are normally involved in anorexigenic responses, reduced inflammation has been independently shown to mediate changes in feeding behaviours and other metabolic parameters, resulting in obesity. Genetic variation in pro-inflammatory cytokines is also associated with both general obesity and weight change during AP treatment, and thus, may be implicated in the pharmacogenetics of AIWG. At this time, preliminary data support a cytokine-mediated model of AIWG which may have clinical utility in developing more effective metabolic monitoring guidelines and prevention measures. However, further research is still needed to clearly elucidate the validity of this immune model. This article reviews the evidence implicating inflammatory cytokines in AIWG and its potential clinical relevance.	448	462	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum cytokine
Eighty-four subjects, premenopausal female patients (n = 42, mean (SD) age: 26.4 (4.2) years) diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 42, mean (SD) age: 27.6(3.4) years), were included in this study. Data on physical examination, anthropometric measurements and blood biochemistry analysis were recorded for each subject along with analysis for SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The relation of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism to PCOS status and insulin resistance was analysed via logistic regression analysis. Mean (SD) levels for BMI (28.5(6.5) vs.22.5 (4.9) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p < .001), HOMA-IR (3.1(1.8) vs.1.5 (1.0), p < .001), LDL-cholesterol (115.9(32.7) vs.100.7 (27.3)mg/dL, p = .03) and triglyceride (113.8(64.9) vs.83.3(36.3)mg/dL, p = .017) were significantly higher in patients. Groups were similar in terms of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism. No significant relation of this polymorphism was noted to PCOS and HOMA-IR. Our findings revealed no difference between groups in terms of the rate of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism, and no significant relation of this polymorphism to insulin resistance and PCOS status. Impact statement Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common cause of anovulation and the most commonly encountered form of female endocrine disease. SOCS proteins have been suggested to play a fundamental role in the negative feedback regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which is the major signalling pathway involved in a wide range of physiologic and pathologic processes, including inflammatory diseases, malignancies and immune disorders. Pathways involving the induction of suppression of SOCS proteins were also shown likely to be involved in mediating cytokine-induced insulin resistance. The present study was designed to determine the frequency of SOCS1-1478 CA/del gene polymorphism in patients with PCOS in relation to healthy controls and insulin resistance. Our findings revealed significantly higher rates of insulin resistance, obesity and dyslipidaemia in Turkish patients with PCOS compared with age-matched healthy controls, while no difference between study groups in terms of the rate of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism along with no significant relation of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism to insulin resistance and PCOS status. Future larger scale studies with the application of standardised diagnostic methods and criteria, and of state-of-the-art modern techniques including genomics, proteomics and pharmacogenetics would provide better understanding of the association between PCOS and genomic variants.	22	35	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	premenopausal

For safe and effective use of antibacterial agents in neonates, specific knowledge on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and its covariates is needed. This necessitates a stepwise approach, including prospective validation. Areas covered: We describe our approach throughout almost two decades to improve amikacin exposure in neonates. A dosing regimen has been developed and validated using pharmacometrics, considering current weight, postnatal age, perinatal asphyxia, and ibuprofen use. This regimen has been developed based on clinical and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data collected during routine care, and subsequently underwent prospective validation. A similar approach has been scheduled to quantify the impact of hypothermia. Besides plasma observations, datasets on deep compartment PK were also collected. Finally, the available literature on developmental toxicology (hearing, renal) of amikacin is summarized. Expert opinion: The amikacin model reflects a semi-physiological function for glomerular filtration. Consequently, this model can be used to develop dosing regimens for other aminoglycosides or to validate physiology-based pharmacokinetic models. Future studies should explore safety with incorporation of covariates like pharmacogenetics, biomarkers, and long-term outcomes. This includes a search for mechanisms of developmental toxicity. Following knowledge generation and grading the level of evidence in support of data, dissemination and implementation initiatives are needed.	742	748	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma
It remains unclear why the dose of xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI) allopurinol or febuxostat varies among patients though they reach similar serum uric acid (SUA) goal. We pursued genomic sequencing of XOI metabolism and clearance genes to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relate to differences in XOI dose. Subjects with a diagnosis of Gout based on the 1977 American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria for the disorder, who were on stable doses of a XOI, and who were at their goal SUA level, were enrolled. The primary outcome was relationship between SNPs in any of these genes to XOI dose. The secondary outcome was relationship between SNPs and change in pre- and post-treatment SUA. We enrolled 100 subjects. The average patient age was 68.6 ± 10.6 years old. Over 80% were men and 77% were Caucasian. One SNP was associated with a higher XOI dose: rs75995567 (p = 0.031). Two SNPs were associated with 300 mg daily of allopurinol: rs11678615 (p = 0.022) and rs3731722 on Aldehyde Oxidase (AO) (His1297Arg) (p = 0.001). Two SNPs were associated with a lower dose of allopurinol: rs1884725 (p = 0.033) and rs34650714 (p = 0.006). For the secondary outcome, rs13415401 was the only SNP related to a smaller mean SUA change. Ten SNPs were identified with a larger change in SUA. Though multiple SNPs were identified in the primary and secondary outcomes of this study, rs3731722 is known to alter catalytic function for some aldehyde oxidase substrates.	143	158	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum uric acid
High-dose methotrexate is a cornerstone agent in the chemotherapeutic treatment of patients with osteosarcoma. However, patients often develop methotrexate-induced toxicities. We aim to identify determinants of methotrexate-induced toxicities in osteosarcoma patients by investigating the relation between drug plasma levels, methotrexate-induced toxicities, and germline variants in genes related to drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. A cohort of 114 osteosarcoma patients was genotyped for 1,931 variants in 231 genes using the Drug Metabolism Enzymes and Transporters Plus array. Methotrexate plasma levels and laboratory measurements during and after high-dose methotrexate treatment concerning renal function, liver damage, and myelopoiesis to reflect toxicity outcomes were obtained. One hundred and thirteen patients and a subset of 545 variants in 176 genes passed quality control checks. Methotrexate plasma levels showed associations with creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, and hemoglobin. Genetic variant rs3736599 in the 5'-untranslated region of <i>SULT1E1</i> was associated with lower 48 hour methotrexate plasma levels [coef -0.313 (95% CI -0.459 - -0.167); p = 2.60 × 10<sup>-5</sup>].

Moreover, a secondary analysis with a binary approach using CTCAE toxicity criteria resulted in a nominal significant associations (p < 0.05) for two out of three variants (rs4803418 and rs4808326). This is the first study to identify genetic variants in <i>SULT1E1, CYP2B6</i>, and <i>CYP4F8</i> to be associated with methotrexate pharmacokinetics and toxicities. Validation of these variants in an independent cohort and further functional investigation of variants in the identified genes is needed to determine if and how they affect methotrexate plasma levels and the development of methotrexate-induced toxicities.	311	317	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma

Morphine prescribed for analgesia has caused drug-related deaths at an estimated incidence of 0.3% to 4%. Morphine has pharmacological properties that make it particularly difficult to assess the causality of morphine administration with a patient's death, such as its slow transfer between plasma and central nervous sites of action and the existence of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide with opioid agonistic effects, Furthermore, there is no well-defined toxic dose or plasma/blood concentration for morphine. Dosing is often adjusted for adequate pain relief. Here, we summarize reported deaths associated with morphine therapy, including associated morphine exposure and modulating patient factors such as pharmacogenetics, concomitant medications, or comorbidities. In addition, we systematically analyzed published numerical information on the stability of concentrations of morphine and its relevant metabolites in biological samples collected postmortem. A medicolegal case is presented in which the causality of morphine administration with death was in dispute and pharmacokinetic modeling was applied to infer the administered dose. The results of this analytical review suggest that (i) inference from postmortem blood concentrations to the morphine dose administered has low validity and (ii) causality between a patient's death and the morphine dose administered remains a highly context-dependent and collaborative assessment among experts from different medical specialties.	1237	1242	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood

The objective of this prospective study was to examine the exposure to the main active metabolites of ciprofloxacin in critically ill patients and to examine the factors (demographic, laboratory and genetic) that could potentially affect the drug metabolic conversion of ciprofloxacin. The secondary aim was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for the metabolite showing the most associations with the abovementioned factors. A total of 29 patients were treated with intravenous infusion of ciprofloxacin and enrolled on this trial. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken at 1, 4, and 11.5 h following the completion of the infusion. Sex, age, body weight, height, serum creatinine and bilirubin levels, and creatinine clearance (CL<sub>CR</sub>) were recorded, and polymorphisms rs2032582 and rs1045642 in the <i>ABCB1</i> gene, rs4148977 in the <i>SLCO1A2</i> gene and rs762551 in the <i>CYP1A2</i> gene were analyzed. A three-stage parent drug-metabolite population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Median (IQR) metabolite/parent ratios of the desethylene ciprofloxacin, formyl ciprofloxacin and oxociprofloxacin were 5.86 (4.09-9.87)%, 4.08 (3.38-6.92)% and 5.91 (3.42-13.65)%, respectively. The desethylene ciprofloxacin metabolic ratio was positively associated with height (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2277, <i>p</i> = 0.0089) and CL<sub>CR</sub> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2023, <i>p</i> = 0.0144) and negatively associated with age (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2227, <i>p</i> = 0.0112). Males had a significantly higher oxociprofloxacin metabolic ratio than females (9.14 vs 3.42%, <i>p</i> = 0.0043). In the desethylene ciprofloxacin population PK model, the volume of distribution decreased with age, the parent drug-metabolite transfer rate constant increased with CL<sub>CR</sub>, and the metabolite elimination rate constant decreased with age and is increased in <i>CYP1A2</i> rs762551 variant allele carriers. We therefore hypothesized that the CYP1A2 inhibition by ciprofloxacin is mediated by its metabolite desethylene ciprofloxacin.	690	706	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum creatinine
Background Despite the well-studied safety profile of dabigatran, its interactions with genetic polymorphism parameters are poorly understood, especially in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD). The study assessed whether genetic factors can contribute to CKD and alter dabigatran concentration. Methods Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and stage 3 CKD treated with dabigatran 110 or 150 mg have been included in the study. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene (rs1045642 and rs4148738) and CES1 gene (rs2244613). A plasma trough concentration/dose (C/D) ratio was used as a pharmacokinetic index. Results A total of 96 patients aged 51-89 years (median age: 75 years) were evaluated. Patients on a reduced regimen of 110 mg twice a day were older (79.8 vs. 67.9, p < 0.0001) and had lower creatinine clearance (49.7 vs. 62.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.015). Patients with the rs2244613 CC genotype had lower C/D values (70% reduction in the mean C/D vs. AA genotype, p = 0.001). Linear stepwise regression has shown the CKD epidemiology collaboration to be the only significant predictor of C/D among genetic factors and kidney function characteristics. During the median follow-up of 15 months, there were 15 bleedings in 13 patients. Conclusions Polymorphism of CES1 rs2244613 can contribute to the safety of dabigatran in patients with AF and CKD. There was no influence of the aforementioned polymorphisms of ABCB1 on dabigatran trough plasma concentrations and C/D. Kidney function is a mainstay of clinical decision-making on direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dose, and further knowledge should be accumulated on the role of genetic factors.	607	613	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma

In pediatric age and particularly in newborn infants the drug efficacy and safety are influenced by the growth and development on drug Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME). Thanks to the fast development of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics, the drug therapy promises to be adapted to the genetic profile of the individual, reducing considerably the side effects of drugs and increasing their efficacy. Interindividual variability in drug response is well known in both adults and children. Such a variability is multifactorial considering both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Drug distribution in the neonate is influenced by a variety of age-dependent factors as a total body water content and distribution variations, role of drug transporters, blood/tissue protein binding, blood and tissue pH and perfusion. The development of enzymes involved in human metabolism were classified in 3 categories: 1) those expressed during the whole or part of the fetal period, but silenced or expressed at low levels within 1-2 years after birth; 2) those expressed at relatively constant levels throughout fetal development, but increased to some extent postnatally; and 3) those whose onset of expression can occur in the third trimester, but substantial increase is noted in the first 1-2 years after birth. Besides this intrinsic aspects influencing pharmacokinetics during the neonatal period there are other important events such as inborn or acquired diseases, environment and finally pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Thousands of deaths every years are caused by fatal drug reactions; among the potential causes there are not only the severity of the disease being treated, drug interactions, nutritional status, renal and liver functions, but also the inherited differences in drug metabolism and genetic polymorphism. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among pediatric patients have been shown to be three times more frequent than in adults. On August 2010 The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) addressed patient safety issues in the NICU, recognizing that to understand and prevent adverse events, systematic research and education in safety issues needed. From all these concepts in terms of ADME, pharmacogenetics (relative to a single gene) and pharmacogenomics (relative to many genes) it is becoming more evident the perspective of the new concept of individualized medicine. The goal of this should be to identify which group of patients responds positively, which patients are nonresponders and who experiences adverse reaction for the same drug and dose. The interindividual variability in response to any drug is mostly dependent on DNA sequence variations across the human genome, the haplotype map (HAPMAP). At present there is still a big distance beween the knowledge in genetic and the practical application to model the drug profile to the genetic/genomic profile of the single patient. In the neonatal period the effects of growth in the pharmacodynamic, processes can help optimizing the dosage of neonatal frequently used medicines, thereby, minimizing their toxicity and increasing their efficacy. It should be useful to create accurate dosage adjustments according to the week of development.	804	809	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood
In this report, we present a case study of how pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics can be useful to characterize safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in early phase new drug development clinical trials. During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p ＜ 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.	348	354	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma

The present study sought to investigate the genetic variants in drug metabolizing enzyme and transporter (DMET) genes associated with steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone among Thai autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. ASD patients taking risperidone for at least 1 month were enrolled for this pharmacogenomic study. Genotyping profile was obtained using Affymetrix DMET Plus array interrogating 1931 variants in 231 genes. Steady-state plasma risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay. The final analysis included 483 markers for 167 genes. Six variants, <i>ABCB11</i> (c.3084A > G, c.<sup>∗</sup>420A > G, c.<sup>∗</sup>368G > A, and c.<sup>∗</sup>236G > A) and <i>ADH7</i> (c.690G > A and c.-5360G > A), were found to be associated with plasma concentrations of risperidone. 9-Hydroxyrisperidone and the total active-moiety levels were associated with six gene variants, <i>SCLO1B1</i> (c.-11187G > A and c.521T > C), <i>SLCO1B3</i> (c.334G > T, c.699A > G, and c.1557G > A), and <i>SLC7A5</i> c.<sup>∗</sup>438C > G.

Increased awareness of the cardiovascular toxic effects of chemotherapy has led to the emergence of cardio-oncology (or onco-cardiology), which focuses on screening, monitoring and treatment of patients with cardiovascular dysfunctions resulting from chemotherapy. Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, and HER2 inhibitors, such as trastuzumab, both have cardiotoxic effects. The biological rationale, mechanisms of action and cardiotoxicity profiles of these two classes of drugs, however, are completely different, suggesting that cardiotoxic effects can occur in a range of different ways. Advances in genomics and proteomics have implicated several genomic variants and biological pathways that can influence the susceptibility to cardiotoxicity from these, and other drugs. Established pathways include multidrug resistance proteins, energy utilization pathways, oxidative stress, cytoskeletal regulation and apoptosis. Gene-expression profiles that have revealed perturbed pathways have vastly increased our knowledge of the complex processes involved in crosstalk between tumours and cardiac function. Utilization of mathematical and computational modelling can complement pharmacogenomics and improve individual patient outcomes. Such endeavours should enable identification of variations in cardiotoxicity, particularly in those patients who are at risk of not recovering, even with the institution of cardioprotective therapy. The application of systems biology holds substantial potential to advance our understanding of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.	27	41	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular

Trinidad & Tobago has the highest prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Caribbean and clopidogrel is a ubiquitously used treatment. Yet, the extent of genetically mediated clopidogrel resistance is unknown. To determine this, we investigated whether the association between CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 genetic variants and clopidogrel resistance holds, and calculated the frequencies of these in the Trinidadian CVD population.	48	62	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Liraglutide is a long-acting human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue and an effective treatment for patients with metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. This review focuses on the mechanism of action of liraglutide as a well-known glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in patients with T2DM and obesity. The lower and the higher doses of GLP-1 RAs are used for glycaemic control in T2DM and in obesity respectively. GLP-1 RAs such as liraglutide enhance insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon release via the stimulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs). Liraglutide decreases hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients when prescribes as monotherapy or in combination with one or more antidiabetic drugs. Usually, it is well tolerated with minor hypoglycemia in combination therapy. Liraglutide reduces cardiovascular events and related risk factors including improvement of lipid profile and control of blood pressure. Accordingly, it can be cost-effective and may be a budget neutral medication option by considering its protective effect on the cardiovascular system in long-term use in the health care plan. In the near future, by pharmacogenomics approach, prediction of the highest patient's response with the lowest adverse drug reactions and also rationality of drug development will be possible. Liraglutide can be used as a desirable medicine for glycemic control and obesity. It shows extensive evidence based benefits in diabetes complications. In this narrative review, we have summarized and evaluated studies related to the role of liraglutide in clinical practice.	888	902	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are now an accepted and widely used first-line treatment for pediatric depression and anxiety. However, the data indicate that SSRI treatment achieves a clinical response in only 55-60% of children, and some may develop drug-induced suicidal behavior. Clinicians have no reliable tools to help them identify in advance those youths who are not likely to respond to an SSRI, or who are likely to develop SSRI-induced suicidality. Pharmacogenetic research attempts to identify genetic markers that are associated with response and side-effect profile. This review covers all the pharmacogenetic studies conducted as yet on pediatric samples and compares them with available data on adult samples. An emphasis is put on serotonergic genes such as the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and additional genes known to be active in the CNS.	873	876	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS
Behçet disease (BD) is an enigmatic inflammatory disorder with multisystemic complications which is endemic in some countries but can be seen in the entire world. Valid diagnostic criteria are available. The pathology is related to a specific perivasculitis with involvement of both arteries and veins of all sizes. Minor arterial and cardiac involvement is frequent in BD but is usually asymptomatic. In exceptional cases cardiac symptoms may be the 1st manifestation of BD. The prevalence of severe cardiac complications (cardio-Behçet) should be < 10%. An impressive therapeutic improvement has been achieved by using appropriate catheterization techniques, coronary and intra-arterial stents, colchicine, drug-response modifying drugs and immunotherapy but, still cardio-Behçet has a poor prognosis. Efforts are undertaken to improve morbidity and prognosis with the use of newer drugs. An important part of the complications in BD are related to the frequent thromboembolic complications and there is high possibility that newer oral anticoagulants will be superior to the classical anticoagulants presently used. Available biologic agents have already been frequently used and seem to have improved the prognosis, but efforts are undertaken to find newer biologic agents with better therapeutic performance and less side-effects. Summarizing as much as possible the effects of the presently used biotherapy in BD, interferon-alpha is effective against many ocular, genital and perhaps vascular manifestations, but its effectiveness is limited by frequent adverse-effects (even if not dangerous for the cardiovascular system). Infliximab is a valid option in the therapy of ocular and cutaneous manifestations but it is less convincing in the therapy of vascular manifestations in vascular- and neuro-Behçet; furthermore, side-effects, including severe cardiovascular complications, are seen in a minority of patients; perhaps worse, infliximab seems to loose efficacy in the long-term therapy, while pharmacogenetics and receptor polymorphism may explain the existence of non-responders and the occurrence of resistance. Adalimumab might be a promising alternative for infliximab and seems to exert a good effect in an eurysmatic and other vascular complications. However, we lack long-term studies. Other biologic agents have been used only in few cases and it is too early to say if they offer new therapeutic perspectives.	1608	1622	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Essential hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of other cardiovascular diseases and is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors, with up to 50% of blood pressure variance currently attributed to an individual's genetic makeup. By studying genes that cause monogenic forms of hypertension and pathways relevant to blood pressure control, a number of polymorphisms have been identified that increase an individual's risk of developing high blood pressure. We report on candidate gene association studies and genome-wide association studies that have been performed to date in the field of hypertension research. It is becoming clear that for the majority of people there is no single gene polymorphism that causes hypertension, but rather a number of common genetic variants, each having a small effect. Using pharmacogenomics to personalize the treatment of hypertension holds promise for achieving and sustaining normotensive pressures quickly, while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions and unwanted side-effects. This will decrease the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in individuals and lead to a reduced burden of disease upon society as a whole.	0	14	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	Cardiovascular

Genetic polymorphisms or variations, randomly distributed in a population, may cause drug-gene response variations. Investigation into these polymorphisms may identify novel mechanisms contributing to a specific disease process. Such investigation necessitates the use of Mendelian randomization, an analytical method that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables for modifiable risk factors that affect population health.<sup>1</sup> In the past decade, advances in our understanding of genetic polymorphisms have enabled the identification of genetic variants in candidate genes that impact low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) regulating pathways and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. A specific candidate gene of interest is that of the LDL receptor degrading protein, PCSK9. In fact, loss-of-function genetic variants for the PCSK9 gene are what first highlighted this pathway as a candidate for pharmacologic inhibition. PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) are a class of cholesterol-lowering medications that provide significant reductions in LDL by inhibiting the degradation of LDL receptors (LDLR). These inhibitors have also been found to reduce production and enhance clearance of lipoprotein A (Lp[a]), an LDL-like particle currently under study as a separate risk factor for atherosclerotic CVD. Here, we discuss the promise of personalized medicine in developing a more efficacious and individualized pharmacogenomics-based approach for the use of PCSK9i that considers genetic variation and targets different patient populations. This review explores the pharmacogenomics of PCSK9i in the context of PCSK9 allele variants related to drug-metabolizing enzymes and responses since more studies are demonstrating that some patients are hyporesponsive or non-responsive to PCSK9i.<sup>2</sup> In summary, the pharmacogenomics of PCSK9 are a promising therapeutic target and genetic information from prospective randomized clinical trials is warranted to gain a full understanding of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of such allele and/or gene-guided PCSK9i therapy.	668	682	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is genetic autosomal recessive disease caused by reduced or absent function of CFTR protein. Treatments for patients with CF have primarily focused on the downstream end-organ consequences of defective CFTR. Since the discovery of the CFTR gene that causes CF in 1989 there have been tremendous advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of CF. This has recently led to the development of new CFTR mutation-specific targeted therapies for select patients with CF. This review will discuss the characteristics of the CFTR gene, the CFTR mutations that cause CF and the new mutation specific pharmacological treatments including gene therapy that are contributing to the dawning of a new era in cystic fibrosis care.	187	196	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	end-organ
Pharmacogenomics addresses the impacts of diverse and multiple genes in populations as determinants of responses of individual patients to drugs. The field has its roots in basic science, and is pivotal in drug development, elucidation of therapeutic efficacy, and constraining the risks of adverse drug reactions. Regulatory agencies are relying increasingly on pharmacogenomics for identification of patients who are particularly likely to benefit from treatment with specific agents and exclusion of those at risk of adverse drug reactions. Practical applications of pharmacogenomics already abound particularly in the use of drugs acting on the central nervous system and on the cardiovascular system. The Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine (SEBM) is proud and pleased to have devoted its 2008 symposium, presented at the annual Experimental Biology meeting in San Diego on April 6, 2008, to advances in pharmacogenomics with emphasis on drug development, regulatory agency considerations, and clinical applications.	649	671	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system

The large-scale implementation of genomic medicine in Africa has not been actualized. This overview describes how routine molecular genetics and advanced protein engineering/structural biotechnology could accelerate the implementation of genomic medicine. By using data-mining and analysis approaches, we analyzed relevant information obtained from public genomic databases on pharmacogenomics biomarkers and reviewed published studies to discuss the ideas. The results showed that only 68 very important pharmacogenes currently exist, while 867 drug label annotations, 201 curated functional pathways, and 746 annotated drugs have been catalogued on the largest pharmacogenomics database (PharmGKB). Only about 5009 variants of the reported ∼25,000 have been clinically annotated. Predominantly, the genetic variants were derived from 43 genes that contribute to 2318 clinically relevant variations in 57 diseases. Majority (∼60%) of the clinically relevant genetic variations in the pharmacogenes are missense variants (1390). The enrichment analysis showed that 15 pharmacogenes are connected biologically and are involved in the metabolism of cardiovascular and cancer drugs. The review of studies showed that cardiovascular diseases are the most frequent non-communicable diseases responsible for approximately 13% of all deaths in Africa. Also, warfarin pharmacogenomics is the most studied drug on the continent, while CYP2D6, CYP2C9, DPD, and TPMT are the most investigated pharmacogenes with allele activities indicated in African and considered to be intermediate metaboliser for DPD and TPMT (8.4% and 11%). In summary, we highlighted a framework for implementing genomic medicine starting from the available resources on ground.	1214	1228	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
No pharmacogenetic studies have yet been conducted in community pharmacies, despite pharmacogenetics being an emerging discipline. Pharmacotherapeutic follow-up (PFU) was performed for 6 months in 37 patients receiving antihypertensive treatment, and they were genotyped for variant alleles *2 and *3 in the CYP2C9 gene and *1B in CYP3A4. Systolic blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, and adherence improved with PFU. Most of the interactions between drugs were represented by concurrent administration of statins and calcium channel blockers, which both use CYP3A4 for their metabolism. Heterozygotic patients for the CYP2C9*2 allele showed higher mean heart rate values after PFU than homozygous patients (73.4 ± 10.0 pulse/min vs 66.2 ± 10.6 pulse/min, respectively; P = .048). Carriers of CYP2C9*2 showed a tendency to less frequent negative outcomes associated with medication due to inefficacy than homozygous patients (50% vs 78.9%, respectively; P = .072). Pharmacogenetics and PFU can be used in community pharmacies to carry out a more exhaustive study of medication in hypertensive outpatients.	364	378	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Understanding and predicting inter-individual differences related to the success of drug therapy is of tremendous importance, both during drug development and for clinical applications. Importantly, while seminal twin studies indicate that the majority of inter-individual differences in drug disposition are driven by hereditary factors, common genetic polymorphisms explain only less than half of this genetically encoded variability. Recent progress in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has for the first time allowed to comprehensively map the genetic landscape of human pharmacogenes. Importantly, these projects have unveiled vast numbers of rare genetic variants, which are estimated to contribute substantially to the missing heritability of drug metabolism phenotypes. However, functional interpretation of these rare variants remains challenging and constitutes one of the important frontiers of contemporary pharmacogenomics. Furthermore, NGS technologies face challenges in the interrogation of genes residing in complex genomic regions, such as CYP2D6 and HLA genes. We here provide an update of the implementation of pharmacogenomic variations in the clinical setting and present emerging strategies that facilitate the translation of NGS data into clinically useful information. Importantly, we anticipate that these developments will soon result in a paradigm shift of pre-emptive genotyping away from the interrogation to candidate variants and towards the comprehensive profiling of an individuals genotype, thus allowing for a true individualization of patient drug treatment regimens.	205	212	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	seminal

Morphine prescribed for analgesia has caused drug-related deaths at an estimated incidence of 0.3% to 4%. Morphine has pharmacological properties that make it particularly difficult to assess the causality of morphine administration with a patient's death, such as its slow transfer between plasma and central nervous sites of action and the existence of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide with opioid agonistic effects, Furthermore, there is no well-defined toxic dose or plasma/blood concentration for morphine. Dosing is often adjusted for adequate pain relief. Here, we summarize reported deaths associated with morphine therapy, including associated morphine exposure and modulating patient factors such as pharmacogenetics, concomitant medications, or comorbidities. In addition, we systematically analyzed published numerical information on the stability of concentrations of morphine and its relevant metabolites in biological samples collected postmortem. A medicolegal case is presented in which the causality of morphine administration with death was in dispute and pharmacokinetic modeling was applied to infer the administered dose. The results of this analytical review suggest that (i) inference from postmortem blood concentrations to the morphine dose administered has low validity and (ii) causality between a patient's death and the morphine dose administered remains a highly context-dependent and collaborative assessment among experts from different medical specialties.	302	323	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous sites
The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment has improved our understanding and management of complex pharmacological issues that have driven improved outcomes and quality of life of the HIV-infected patient. These issues include adherence, long- and short-term toxicities, pharmacoenhancement, pharmacogenomics, therapeutic drug monitoring, differential penetration of drugs into sanctuary sites, such as the central nervous system, genital tract and small bowel, and drug-drug and drug-food interactions related to cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferases and drug transporters, to name a few. There is future promise, as an increased understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HIV and global public health initiatives are driving novel treatment approaches with goals to prevent, control and, ultimately, eradicate HIV.	427	449	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system
Existing warfarin dose prediction algorithms based on pharmacogenetics and clinical parameters have not been used clinically due to the absence of external validation, lack of assessment for clinical utility, and high risk of bias. Moreover, given the high degree of heterogeneity across different datasets used to develop these algorithms, it is unsurprising that prediction errors remain high, and dosing accuracy is dependent on specific ethnic populations. To circumvent these challenges, deep neural models are increasingly used to improve the precision and accuracy of warfarin dose predictions. Hence, this study sought to develop a deep learning-based model using a well-established curated dataset of over 6000 patients from the International Warfarin Pharmacogenomics Consortium (IWPC). Clinically-relevant input data such as physical attributes, medical conditions, concomitant medications, genotype status of functional warfarin genetic polymorphisms, and therapeutic INR were entered followed by applying a unique and robust training and validation method. The deep model yielded a low average mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.6 mg/week and a relatively low mean percentage of error of 40.9% in Asians, 14.2 mg/week MAE and 36.9% in African Americans, and 12.7 mg/week MAE and 45.4% mean percentage of error in White Caucasians. This model also resulted in 36.4% of all patients with a predicted dose within 20% of the administered dose. Hence, our proposed deep model provides an alternative to predicting warfarin dose in the clinical setting upon validation in ethnically-similar datasets.	1575	1593	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	ethnically-similar
Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) represents a common final pathway leading to heart failure. We have searched for genetic determinants of left ventricular (LV) mass using values for absolute electrocardiographic QRS voltage in a healthy Japanese population. After adjusting for covariates, the corrected S and R wave voltages in leads V1 and V5 from 2,994 healthy volunteers in the Japan Pharmacogenomics Data Science Consortium (JPDSC) database were subjected to a genome-wide association study. Potential associations were validated by an in silico replication study using an independent Japanese population obtained from the Nagahama Prospective Genome Cohort for Comprehensive Human Bioscience. We identified a novel association between the lead V5, R wave voltage in Japanese individuals and SNP rs7301743[G], which maps near the gene encoding T-box transcription factor Tbx3. Meta-analysis of two independent Japanese datasets demonstrated a marginally significant association of SNP rs7301743 in TBX3|MED13L with a 0.071 mV (95% CI, 0.038-0.11 mV) shorter R wave amplitude in the V5 lead per minor allele copy (P = 7.635 x 10(-8)). The transcriptional repressor, TBX3, is proposed to suppress the development of working ventricular myocardium. Our findings suggest that genetic variation of Tbx3 is associated with LV mass in a healthy Japanese population.	158	160	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	LV
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have a high mortality rate, and despite the several available therapeutic targets, non-response to antihypertensives remains a common problem. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are important classes of drugs recommended as first-line therapy for several CVDs. However, response to ACEIs and ARBs varies among treated patients. Pharmacogenomics assesses how an individual's genetic characteristics affect their likely response to drug therapy. Currently, numerous studies suggest that genetic polymorphisms may contribute to variability in drug response. Moreover, further studies evaluating gene-gene interactions within signaling pathways in response to antihypertensives might help to unravel potential genetic predictors for antihypertensive response. This review summarizes the pharmacogenetic data for ACEIs and ARBs in patients with CVD, and discusses the potential pharmacogenetics of these classes of antihypertensives in clinical practice. However, replication studies in different populations are needed. In addition, studies that evaluate gene-gene interactions that share signaling pathways in the response to antihypertensive drugs might facilitate the discovery of genetic predictors for antihypertensive response.	0	14	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	Cardiovascular
Dementia is an important issue in western societies, and in the following years, this problem will also rise in the developing regions, such as Africa and Asia. The most common types of dementia in adults are Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Vascular Dementia (VaD), of which, AD accounts for more than half of the cases. The most prominent symptom of AD is cognitive impairment, currently treated with four drugs: Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, enhancing cholinergic transmission; as well as memantine, protecting neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity. Despite ongoing efforts, no new drugs in the treatment of AD have been registered for the last ten years, thus multiple studies have been conducted on genetic factors affecting the efficacy of antidementia pharmacotherapy. The researchers investigate the effects of variants in multiple genes, such as ABCB1, ACE, CHAT, CHRNA7, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, NR1I2, NR1I3, POR, PPAR, RXR, SLC22A1/2/5, SLC47A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 and UGT2B7, associated with numerous pathways: the development of pathological proteins, formation and metabolism of acetylcholine, transport, metabolism and excretion of antidementia drugs and transcription factors regulating the expression of genes responsible for metabolism and transport of drugs. The most promising results have been demonstrated for APOE E4, dementia risk variant, BCHE-K, reduced butyrylcholinesterase activity variant, and CYP2D6 UM, ultrarapid hepatic metabolism. Further studies investigate the possibilities of the development of emerging drugs or genetic editing by CRISPR/Cas9 for causative treatment. In conclusion, the pharmacogenetic studies on dementia diseases may improve the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in some patients with beneficial genetic variants, at the same time, identifying the carriers of unfavorable alleles, the potential group of novel approaches to the treatment and prevention of dementia.	249	253	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	Lewy
Sex is an important variable in biomedical research. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly utilized as a powerful new model organism in translational neuroscience and pharmacology. Mounting evidence indicates important sex differences in zebrafish behavioral and neuropharmacological responses. Here, we discuss the role of sex in zebrafish central nervous system (CNS) models, their molecular mechanisms, recent findings and the existing challenges in this field. We also emphasize the growing utility of zebrafish models in translational neuropharmacological research of sex differences, fostering future CNS drug discovery and the search for novel sex-specific therapies. Finally, we highlight the interplay between sex and environment in zebrafish models of sex-environment correlations as an important strategy of CNS disease modeling using this aquatic organism.	371	374	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS

Recent advances in genomic medicine have contributed to the acceleration of our understanding regarding the pathogenesis of dementia, improving diagnostic accuracy with the introduction of novel biomarkers and personalizing therapeutics with the incorporation of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic procedures to drug development and clinical practice. Most neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), share some common features, such as a genomic background in which hundreds of genes might be involved, genome-environment interactions, complex pathogenic pathways, poor therapeutic outcomes and chronic disability. The main aim of a cost-effective treatment is to halt disease progression via modification of the functional cascade involving AD genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Unfortunately, the drugs available for the treatment of dementia are not cost effective. The pharmacological treatment of dementia accounts for 10-20% of direct costs, and fewer than 20% of the patients are moderate responders to conventional drugs, some of which may cause important adverse drug reactions. Future antidementia drugs must address the complex pathogenic niche of the disease from a multifactorial perspective. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic factors may account for 60-90% of drug variability in drug disposition and pharmacodynamics. In addition to antidementia drugs, patients with AD or with other forms of dementia need concomitant medications for the treatment of diverse disorders of the CNS associated with progressive brain dysfunction. Approximately 60-80% of drugs acting on the CNS are metabolized via enzymes of the CYP gene superfamily, and 10-20% of Caucasians are carriers of defective CYP2D6 polymorphic variants that alter the metabolism of many psychotropic agents. Only 26% of the patients are pure extensive metabolizers for the trigenic cluster integrated by allelic variants of the CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 in combination. Although many genes have been suggested to be associated with AD, with the exception of APOE, most polymorphic variants of potential risk exhibit a very weak association with AD. APOE-4/4 carriers exhibit a dramatic biological disadvantage in comparison with other genotypes, and AD patients harboring this homozygous condition are the worst responders to conventional drugs. The incorporation of pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic protocols into AD research and clinical practice can foster the optimization of therapeutics by helping to develop cost-effective biopharmaceuticals and improving drug efficacy and safety.	1538	1541	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS

In pediatric age and particularly in newborn infants the drug efficacy and safety are influenced by the growth and development on drug Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME). Thanks to the fast development of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics, the drug therapy promises to be adapted to the genetic profile of the individual, reducing considerably the side effects of drugs and increasing their efficacy. Interindividual variability in drug response is well known in both adults and children. Such a variability is multifactorial considering both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Drug distribution in the neonate is influenced by a variety of age-dependent factors as a total body water content and distribution variations, role of drug transporters, blood/tissue protein binding, blood and tissue pH and perfusion. The development of enzymes involved in human metabolism were classified in 3 categories: 1) those expressed during the whole or part of the fetal period, but silenced or expressed at low levels within 1-2 years after birth; 2) those expressed at relatively constant levels throughout fetal development, but increased to some extent postnatally; and 3) those whose onset of expression can occur in the third trimester, but substantial increase is noted in the first 1-2 years after birth. Besides this intrinsic aspects influencing pharmacokinetics during the neonatal period there are other important events such as inborn or acquired diseases, environment and finally pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Thousands of deaths every years are caused by fatal drug reactions; among the potential causes there are not only the severity of the disease being treated, drug interactions, nutritional status, renal and liver functions, but also the inherited differences in drug metabolism and genetic polymorphism. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among pediatric patients have been shown to be three times more frequent than in adults. On August 2010 The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) addressed patient safety issues in the NICU, recognizing that to understand and prevent adverse events, systematic research and education in safety issues needed. From all these concepts in terms of ADME, pharmacogenetics (relative to a single gene) and pharmacogenomics (relative to many genes) it is becoming more evident the perspective of the new concept of individualized medicine. The goal of this should be to identify which group of patients responds positively, which patients are nonresponders and who experiences adverse reaction for the same drug and dose. The interindividual variability in response to any drug is mostly dependent on DNA sequence variations across the human genome, the haplotype map (HAPMAP). At present there is still a big distance beween the knowledge in genetic and the practical application to model the drug profile to the genetic/genomic profile of the single patient. In the neonatal period the effects of growth in the pharmacodynamic, processes can help optimizing the dosage of neonatal frequently used medicines, thereby, minimizing their toxicity and increasing their efficacy. It should be useful to create accurate dosage adjustments according to the week of development.	979	984	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	fetal

The major challenges that delay the implementation of pharmacogenomics based clinical practice in the developing countries, primarily the low- and middle-income countries need to be recognized. This review was conducted to systematically review evidence of the cost-effectiveness for the conduct of pharmacogenomics testing in the developing countries. Studies that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics testing in the developing countries as defined by the United Nations were included in this study. Twenty-seven articles met the criteria. Pharmacogenomics effectiveness were evaluated for drugs used in the treatment of cancers, cardiovascular diseases and severe cutaneous adverse reactions in gout and epilepsy. Most studies had reported pharmacogenomics testing to be cost-effective (cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and tuberculosis) and economic models were evaluated from multiple perspectives, different cost categories and time horizons. Additionally, most studies used a single gene, rather than a gene panel for the pharmacogenomics testing. Genotyping cost and frequency of risk alleles in the populations influence the cost-effectiveness outcome. Further studies are warranted to examine the clinical and economic validity of pharmacogenomics testing in the developing countries.	647	661	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular

A large number of women receive codeine for obstetric pain while breastfeeding. Following a case of fatal opioid poisoning in a breastfed neonate whose codeine prescribed mother was a CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer (UM), we examined characteristics of mothers and infants with or without signs of central nervous system (CNS) depression following codeine exposure while breastfeeding in a case-control study. Mothers of symptomatic infants (n = 17) consumed a mean 59% higher codeine dose than mothers of asymptomatic infants (n = 55) (1.62 (0.79) mg/kg/day vs. 1.02 (0.54) mg/kg/day; P = 0.004). There was 71% concordance between maternal and neonatal CNS depression. Two mothers whose infants exhibited severe neonatal toxicity were CYP2D6 UMs and of the UGT2B7*2/*2 genotype. There may be a dose-response relationship between maternal codeine use and neonatal toxicity, and strong concordance between maternal-infant CNS depressive symptoms. Breastfed infants of mothers who are CYP2D6 UMs combined with the UGT2B7*2/*2 are at increased risk of potentially life-threatening CNS depression.	296	318	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system

Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are NAD⁺-dependent protein deacetylases/ADP ribosyltransferases with important roles in chromatin silencing, cell cycle regulation, cellular differentiation, cellular stress response, metabolism and aging. Sirtuins are components of the epigenetic machinery, which is disturbed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing to AD pathogenesis. There is an association between the <i>SIRT2-C/T</i> genotype (rs10410544) (50.92%) and AD susceptibility in the <i>APOEε4</i>-negative population (<i>SIRT2-C/C</i>, 34.72%; <i>SIRT2-T/T</i> 14.36%). The integration of <i>SIRT2</i> and <i>APOE</i> variants in bigenic clusters yields 18 haplotypes. The 5 most frequent bigenic genotypes in AD are <i>33CT</i> (27.81%), <i>33CC</i> (21.36%), <i>34CT</i> (15.29%), <i>34CC</i> (9.76%) and <i>33TT</i> (7.18%). There is an accumulation of <i>APOE-3/4</i> and <i>APOE-4/4</i> carriers in <i>SIRT2-T/T</i> > <i>SIRT2-C/T</i> > <i>SIRT2-C/C</i> carriers, and also of <i>SIRT2-T/T</i> and <i>SIRT2-C/T</i> carriers in patients who harbor the <i>APOE-4/4</i> genotype. <i>SIRT2</i> variants influence biochemical, hematological, metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes, and modestly affect the pharmacoepigenetic outcome in AD. <i>SIRT2-C/T</i> carriers are the best responders, <i>SIRT2-T/T</i> carriers show an intermediate pattern, and <i>SIRT2-C/C</i> carriers are the worst responders to a multifactorial treatment. In <i>APOE-SIRT2</i> bigenic clusters, <i>33CC</i> carriers respond better than <i>33TT</i> and <i>34CT</i> carriers, whereas <i>24CC</i> and <i>44CC</i> carriers behave as the worst responders. CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EM) are the best responders, poor metabolizers (PM) are the worst responders, and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM) tend to be better responders that intermediate metabolizers (IM). In association with <i>CYP2D6</i> genophenotypes, <i>SIRT2-C/T</i>-EMs are the best responders. Some Sirtuin modulators might be potential candidates for AD treatment.	1144	1158	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular

Hypertension is a leading age-related disease in our society and if left untreated, leads to fatal cardiovascular complications. The prevalence of hypertension has increased and becomes a significant global health economic burden, particularly in lower-income societies. Many loci associated with blood pressure and hypertension have been reported by genome-wide association studies that provided potential targets for pharmacotherapy. Pharmacogenetic research had shown interindividual variations in drug efficacy, safety, and tolerability. This could be due to genetic polymorphisms in the pharmacokinetics (genes involved in a transporter, plasma protein binding, and metabolism) or pharmacodynamic pathway (receptors, ion channels, enzymes). Pharmacogenetics promises great hope toward targeted therapy, but challenges remain in implementing pharmacogenetic aided antihypertensive therapy in clinical practice. Using various databases, we analyzed the underlying mechanisms between the candidate gene polymorphisms and antihypertensive drug interactions and the challenges of implementing precision medicine. We review the emergence of pharmacogenetics and its relevance to clinical pharmacological practice.	99	113	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are some of the most widely prescribed medications worldwide and have been shown to be effective at lowering cholesterol in numerous long-term prospective trials, yet there are significant limitations to their use. First, patients receiving statin therapy have relatively low levels of medication adherence compared with other drug classes. Next, numerous statin formulations are available, each with its own unique safety and efficacy profile, and it may be unclear to prescribers which treatment is optimal for their patients. Finally, statins have class-wide side effects of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis that have resulted in a product recall and dosage limitations. Recent evidence suggests that two genomic markers, KIF6 and SLCO1B1, may inform the therapy choice of patients initiating statins. Given the prevalence of statin usage, their potential health advantages and their overall cost to the healthcare system, there could be significant clinical benefit from creating personalized treatment regimens. Ultimately, if this approach is effective it may encourage higher adoption of generic statins when appropriate, promote adherence, lower rates of myopathy, and overall achieve higher value cardiovascular care. This paper will review the evidence for personalized prescribing of statins via KIF6 and SLCO1B1 and consider some of the implications for testing these markers as part of routine clinical care.	1258	1272	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Human leukocyte antigen (<i>HLA</i>) encoded by the <i>HLA</i> gene is an important modulator for immune responses and drug hypersensitivity reactions as well. Genetic polymorphisms of <i>HLA</i> vary widely at population level and are responsible for developing severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), maculopapular exanthema (MPE). The associations of different <i>HLA</i> alleles with the risk of drug induced SJS/TEN, DRESS and MPE are strongly supportive for clinical considerations. Prescribing guidelines generated by different national and international working groups for translation of <i>HLA</i> pharmacogenetics into clinical practice are underway and functional in many countries, including Thailand. Cutting edge genomic technologies may accelerate wider adoption of <i>HLA</i> screening in routine clinical settings. There are great opportunities and several challenges as well for effective implementation of <i>HLA</i> genotyping globally in routine clinical practice for the prevention of drug induced SCARs substantially, enforcing precision medicine initiatives.	404	416	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	eosinophilia
Most neurodegenerative diseases are currently incurable, with large social and economic impacts. Recently, there has been renewed interest in investigating natural products in the modern drug discovery paradigm as novel, bioactive small molecules. Moreover, the discovery of potential therapies for neurological disorders is challenging and involves developing optimized animal models for drug screening. In contemporary biomedicine, the growing need to develop experimental models to obtain a detailed understanding of malady conditions and to portray pioneering treatments has resulted in the application of zebrafish to close the gap between in vitro and in vivo assays. Zebrafish in pharmacogenetics and neuropharmacology are rapidly becoming a widely used organism. Brain function, dysfunction, genetic, and pharmacological modulation considerations are enhanced by both larval and adult zebrafish. Bioassay-guided identification of natural products using zebrafish presents as an attractive strategy for generating new lead compounds. Here, we see evidence that the zebrafish's central nervous system is suitable for modeling human neurological disease and we review and evaluate natural product research using zebrafish as a vertebrate model platform to systematically identify bioactive natural products. Finally, we review recently developed zebrafish models of neurological disorders that have the potential to be applied in this field of research.	1084	1106	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system
Studies in hypertension (HTN) pharmacogenomics seek to identify genetic sources of variable antihypertensive drug response. Genetic association studies have detected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that link to drug responses; however, to understand mechanisms underlying how genetic traits alter drug responses, a biological interface is needed. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potential source for studying otherwise inaccessible tissues that may be important to antihypertensive drug response. The present study established multiple iPSC lines from an HTN pharmacogenomics cohort. We demonstrated that established HTN iPSCs can robustly and reproducibly differentiate into functional vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), a cell type most relevant to vasculature tone control. Moreover, a sensitive traction force microscopy assay demonstrated that iPSC-derived VSMCs show a quantitative contractile response on physiological stimulus of endothelin-1. Furthermore, the inflammatory chemokine tumor necrosis factor α induced a typical VSMC response in iPSC-derived VSMCs.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the ABCB1 (formerly MDR1) gene, is among the most well-characterized drug transporters, particularly in veterinary medicine. P-gp is expressed by a variety of normal tissues, including the intestines, brain capillary endothelial cells, renal tubular cells, and biliary canalicular cells, where it functions to actively extrude substrate drugs. In this capacity, P-gp limits oral absorption and central nervous system entry of many substrate drugs and enhances their excretion from the body. Many drugs used in veterinary medicine are substrates for P-gp, including many chemotherapeutic agents and macrocyclic lactones (avermectins and milbemycin). A 4-base pair deletion mutation in the ABCB1 gene occurs in many herding breed dogs, including collies, Australian shepherds, and Shetland sheepdogs. The mutation (ABCB1-1Delta) renders affected animals extremely susceptible to toxicosis induced by substrate drugs, such as the macrocyclic lactones at doses well below those tolerated by dogs with the wild-type ABCB1 gene. However, at the manufacturer's recommended dose, all FDA-approved heartworm preventive products marketed in the United States are safe, even for dogs with the ABCB1 mutant/mutant genotype.	560	582	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system
Various diseases require the selection of preferable treatment out of available alternatives. Multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune inflammatory/neurodegenerative disease of the CNS, requires long-term medication with either specific disease-modifying therapy (DMT) - IFN-β or glatiramer acetate (GA) - which remain the only first-line DMTs in all countries. A significant share of MS patients are resistant to treatment with one or the other DMT; therefore, the earliest choice of preferable DMT is of particular importance. A number of conventional pharmacogenetic studies performed up to the present day have identified the treatment-sensitive genetic biomarkers that might be specific for the particular drug; however, the suitable biomarkers for selection of one or another first-line DMT are remained to be found. Comparative pharmacogenetic analysis may allow the identification of the discriminative genetic biomarkers, which may be more informative for an a priori DMT choice than those found in conventional pharmacogenetic studies. The search for discriminative markers of preferable first-line DMT, which differ in carriage between IFN-β responders and GA responders as well as between IFN-β nonresponders and GA nonresponders, has been performed in 253 IFN-β-treated MS patients and 285 GA-treated MS patients. A bioinformatics algorithm for identification of composite biomarkers (allelic sets) was applied on a unified set of immune-response genes, which are relevant for IFN-β and/or GA modes of action, and identical clinical criteria of treatment response. We found the range of discriminative markers, which include polymorphic variants of CCR5, IFNAR1, TGFB1, DRB1 or CTLA4 genes, in different combinations. Every allelic set includes the CCR5 genetic variant, which probably suggests its crucial role in the modulation of the DMT response. Special attention should be given to the (CCR5*d+ IFNAR1*G) discriminative combination, which clearly points towards IFN-β treatment choice for carriers of this combination. As a whole the comparative approach provides an option for the identification of prognostic composite biomarkers for a preferable medication among available alternatives.	179	182	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS
Hypertension is the strongest modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, affecting 80 million individuals in the US and responsible for ∼360,000 deaths, at total annual costs of $93.5 billion. Antihypertension therapies guided by single genotypes are clinically more effective and may avert more adverse events than the standard of care of layering anti-hypertensive drug therapies, thus potentially decreasing costs. This study aimed to determine the economic benefits of the implementation of multi-gene panel guided therapies for hypertension from the payer perspective within a 3-year time horizon.	57	71	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
The statin class of cholesterol-lowering drugs have been used for decades to successfully lower plasma cholesterol concentrations and cardiovascular risk. Adverse effects of statins are generally considered mild, but increase with age of patients and polypharmacy. One aspect of statin therapy that is still difficult for prescribers to predict is the individual's response to statin therapy. Recent advances in the field of pharmacogenomics have indicated variants of candidate genes that affect statin efficacy and safety. In this review, a number of candidates that affect statin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are discussed. Some of these candidates, in particular those involved in import and efflux of statins, have now been linked to increased risk of side effects. Furthermore, pharmacogenomic studies continue to reveal new players that are involved in the fine-tuning of the complex regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and response to statins.	134	148	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
FSH brings about its physiological actions by activating a specific receptor located on target cells. Normal functioning of the FSH receptor (FSHR) is crucial for follicular development and estradiol production in females and for the regulation of Sertoli cell function and spermatogenesis in males. In the last two decades, the number of inactivating and activating mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and spliced variants of FSHR gene has been identified in selected infertile cases. Information on genotype-phenotype correlation and in vitro functional characterization of the mutants has helped in understanding the possible genetic cause for female infertility in affected individuals. The information is also being used to dissect various extracellular and intracellular events involved in hormone-receptor interaction by studying the differences in the properties of the mutant receptor when compared with WT receptor. Studies on polymorphisms in the FSHR gene have shown variability in clinical outcome among women treated with FSH. These observations are being explored to develop molecular markers to predict the optimum dose of FSH required for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Pharmacogenetics is an emerging field in this area that aims at designing individual treatment protocols for reproductive abnormalities based on FSHR gene polymorphisms. The present review discusses the current knowledge of various genetic alterations in FSHR and their impact on receptor function in the female reproductive system.	163	173	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	follicular

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 gene have been associated with high interindividual variation in efavirenz pharmacokinetics.

Drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions are of major medical concern because they are associated with high morbidity and high mortality. In addition, individual patients' reactions are impossible to predict in each patient. In the field of severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cutaneous ADR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DHIS) or drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), major advances have recently been gained through studies of an association between HLA alleles and drug hypersensitivity induced by specific drugs. The results of these pharmacogenomic studies allow prediction of the risk of adverse reactions in patients treated with certain drugs, including carbamazepine and other aromatic antiepileptic drugs, allopurinol and abacavir. However, different ethnic populations show variations in the genetic associations. A strong association between carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN and HLA-B*1502 has been found in Southeast Asian patients but not in Caucasian and Japanese patients. Moderate associations between aromatic amine anticonvulsants and other HLA alleles have been proposed in Japanese patients. In contrast, HLA-B*5801 was found to be associated with allopurinol-induced cutaneous ADR, including SJS/TEN and DIHS/DRESS, in Caucasian and Asian patients, including the Japanese. These differences may, at least in part, be due to the differences in allele frequency in different ethnic populations. This article reviews the progress in pharmacogenomics, associated mainly with carbamazepine and allopurinol in different ethnic populations. Pharmacogenetic screening based on associations between adverse reactions and specific HLA alleles helps to avoid serious conditions associated with drug hypersensitivity.	438	450	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	eosinophilia
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system, often resulting in significant disability in early adulthood. The field of pharmacogenomics holds promise in distinguishing responders from non-responders to drug treatment. Most studies on genetic polymorphisms in MS have addressed treatment with interferon-β, yet few findings have been replicated. This review outlines the barriers that currently hinder the validity, reproducibility, and inter-study comparison of pharmacogenomics research as it relates to the use of interferon-β. Notably, statistical power, varying definitions of responder status, varying assay and genotyping methodologies, and anti-interferon-β neutralizing antibodies significantly confound existing data. Future work should focus on addressing these factors in order to optimize interferon-β treatment outcomes in MS.	57	79	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system
This review focuses first on the concept of pharmacogenomics and its related concepts (biomarkers and personalized prescription). Next, the first generation of five DNA pharmacogenomic tests used in the clinical practice of psychiatry is briefly reviewed. Then the possible involvement of these pharmacogenomic tests in the exploration of early clinical proof of mechanism is described by using two of the tests and one example from the pharmaceutical industry (iloperidone clinical trials). The initial attempts to use other microarray tests (measuring RNA expression) as peripheral biomarkers for CNS disorders are briefly described. Then the challenge of taking pharmacogenomic tests (compared to drugs) into clinical practice is explained by focusing on regulatory oversight, the methodological/scientific issues concerning diagnostic tests, and cost-effectiveness issues. Current information on medicine-based evidence and cost-effectiveness usually focuses on average patients and not the outliers who are most likely to benefit from personalized prescription. Finally, future research directions are suggested. The future of 'personalized prescription' in psychiatry requires consideration of pharmacogenomic testing and environmental and personal variables that influence pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug response for each individual drug used by each patient.	599	602	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS
Although aspirin is a well-established antiplatelet agent, the mechanisms of aspirin resistance remain poorly understood. Metabolomics allows for measurement of hundreds of small molecules in biological samples, enabling detailed mapping of pathways involved in drug response. We defined the metabolic signature of aspirin exposure in subjects from the Heredity and Phenotype Intervention Heart Study. Many metabolites, including known aspirin catabolites, changed on exposure to aspirin, and pathway enrichment analysis identified purine metabolism as significantly affected by drug exposure. Furthermore, purines were associated with aspirin response, and poor responders had higher postaspirin adenosine and inosine levels than did good responders (n = 76; both P < 4 × 10(-3)). Using our established "pharmacometabolomics-informed pharmacogenomics" approach, we identified genetic variants in adenosine kinase associated with aspirin response. Combining metabolomics and genomics allowed for more comprehensive interrogation of mechanisms of variation in aspirin response--an important step toward personalized treatment approaches for cardiovascular disease.	1140	1154	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
It is well established that the CYP2C19 nonfunctional *2 and *3 polymorphisms impair the bioactivation and antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel, and increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events following percutaneous coronary intervention. In contrast, CYP2C19 genotype does not impact clinical response to prasugrel or ticagrelor. Recent studies have evaluated the impact of CYP2C19 genotype-guided selection of antiplatelet therapy on clinical outcomes and begun to close some of the gaps in knowledge and uncertainty that have impeded widespread clinical implementation of this precision medicine approach. This review will critically evaluate recent data and offer new insight into the potential clinical utility of genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy in the context of current clinical practice guidelines.	177	191	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
About 30% of approved drugs are cleared predominantly by renal clearance (CL<sub>r</sub>). Of these, many are secreted by transporters. For these drugs, in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation of transporter-mediated renal secretory clearance (CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub>) is important to prospectively predict their renal clearance and to assess the impact of drug-drug interactions and pharmacogenetics on their pharmacokinetics. Here we compared the ability of the relative expression factor (REF) and the relative activity factor (RAF) approaches to quantitatively predict the in vivo CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> of 26 organic anion transporter (OAT) substrates assuming that OAT-mediated uptake is the rate-determining step in the CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> of the drugs. The REF approach requires protein quantification of each transporter in the tissue (e.g., kidney) and transporter-expressing cells, whereas the RAF approach requires the use of a transporter-selective probe substrate (both in vitro and in vivo) for each transporter of interest. For the REF approach, 50% and 69% of the CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> predictions were within 2- and 3-fold of the observed values, respectively; the corresponding values for the RAF approach were 65% and 81%. We found no significant difference between the two approaches in their predictive capability (as measured by accuracy and bias) of the CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> or CL<sub>r</sub> of OAT drugs. We recommend that the REF and RAF approaches can be used interchangeably to predict OAT-mediated CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> Further research is warranted to evaluate the ability of the REF or RAF approach to predict CL<sub>sec,plasma</sub> of drugs when uptake is not the rate-determining step. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This is the first direct comparison of the relative expression factor (REF) and relative activity factor (RAF) approaches to predict transporter-mediated renal clearance (CL<sub>r</sub>). The RAF, but not REF, approach requires transporter-selective probes and that the basolateral uptake is the rate-determining step in the CL<sub>r</sub> of drugs. Given that there is no difference in predictive capability of the REF and RAF approach for organic anion transporter-mediated CL<sub>r</sub>, the REF approach should be explored further to assess its ability to predict CL<sub>r</sub> when basolateral uptake is not the sole rate-determining step.	1905	1910	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	renal
Puerto Ricans are a unique Hispanic population with European, Native American (Taino), and higher West African ancestral contributions than other non-Caribbean Hispanics. In admixed populations, such as Puerto Ricans, genetic variants can be found at different frequencies when compared to parental populations and uniquely combined and distributed. Therefore, in this review, we aimed to collect data from studies conducted in healthy Puerto Ricans and to report the frequencies of genetic polymorphisms with major relevance in drug response. Filtering for healthy volunteers or individuals, we performed a search of pharmacogenetic studies in academic literature databases without limiting the period of the results. The search was limited to Puerto Ricans living in the island, excluding those studies performed in mainland (United States). We found that the genetic markers impacting pharmacological therapy in the areas of cardiovascular, oncology, and neurology are the most frequently investigated. Coincidently, the top causes of mortality in the island are cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. In addition, polymorphisms in genes that encode for members of the CYP450 family (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6) are also available due to their relevance in the metabolism of drugs. The complex genetic background of Puerto Ricans is responsible for the divergence in the reported allele frequencies when compared to parental populations (Africans, East Asians, and Europeans). The importance of reporting the findings of pharmacogenetic studies conducted in Puerto Ricans is to identify genetic variants with potential utility among this genetically complex population and eventually move forward the adoption of personalized medicine in the island.	1066	1080	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Tachycardia is a common cardiovascular disease. Drugs blocking β1-adrenergic receptors (ADRB1) are used in the therapy of arrhythmogenic heart diseases. Disease-related polymorphisms can be observed within the <i>ADRB1</i> gene. The two most important are Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly, and they influence the treatment efficacy. The family of the cytochrome P450 system consists of the isoenzyme CYP2D6 (Debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase), which is involved in phase I metabolism of almost 25% of clinically important drugs, including antiarrhythmic drugs. A study was conducted to detect the <i>ADRB1</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i> gene polymorphisms. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: The material for the test was whole blood from 30 patients with ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia and 20 controls. The samples were obtained from the Department of Pediatric Cardiology. The first to be made was the extraction of DNA using a GeneMATRIX Quick Blood DNA Purification Kit from EURx. The selected <i>ADRB1</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i> gene polymorphisms were detected by high-resolution melting polymerase chain reaction (HRM-PCR) analysis. <i>Results</i>: Based on the analysis of melt profile data for each PCR product, the identification of polymorphisms was carried out. Heterozygotes and homozygotes were found in the examined alleles. <i>Conclusions</i>: The frequency of the Arg389Gly polymorphism differs statistically significantly between the control group and patients with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as between these two groups of patients. Moreover, the Arg389Gly polymorphism was statistically more prevalent in the group of girls with SVT arrhythmia compared to girls with VT. A few carriers of homozygous and heterozygous systems of the S49G polymorphism were detected among patients with arrhythmias, as well as control group. The percentage of individuals carrying the <i>CYP2D6 4</i> allele as either homozygous or heterozygous was observed in the study and control groups. The high prevalence of the <i>CYP2D6*4</i> allele carriers in both groups prompts the optimization of beta-1 blocker therapy.	58	72	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS) may cause future stroke and therefore patients with ACAS require best medical treatment. Patients at high risk for stroke may opt for additional revascularization (either surgery or stenting) but the future stroke risk should outweigh the risk for peri/post-operative stroke/death. Current risk stratification for patients with ACAS is largely based on outdated randomized-controlled trials that lack the integration of improved medical therapies and risk factor control. Furthermore, recent circulating and imaging biomarkers for stroke have never been included in a risk stratification model. The TAXINOMISIS Project aims to develop a new risk stratification model for cerebrovascular complications in patients with ACAS and this will be tested through a prospective observational multicentre clinical trial performed in six major European vascular surgery centres.	715	730	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cerebrovascular
Second-generation antipsychotics can greatly improve symptoms of psychosis-spectrum disorders. Unfortunately, these drugs are associated with weight gain, which increases a patient's risk for developing chronic diseases including Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or other obesity-related complications. There are interindividual differences in weight gain resulting from antipsychotic drug use that may be explained by pharmacodynamic characteristics of these agents as well as clinical factors. In addition, genetic variations in pathways associated with satiety are increasingly recognized as potential contributors to antipsychotic-associated weight gain. Polymorphisms in the leptin gene, as well as the leptin receptor gene, are potential pharmacogenetic markers associated with these outcomes. This article summarizes evidence for the associations of the leptin gene and the leptin receptor gene polymorphisms with antipsychotic-induced weight gain, potential mechanisms underlying these relationships, and discusses areas for future pharmacogenetic investigation.	247	261	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Type 2 diabetes is one of the major causes of mortality with rapidly increasing prevalence. Pharmacological treatment is the first recommended approach after failure in lifestyle changes. However, a significant number of patients shows-or develops along time and disease progression-drug resistance. In addition, not all type 2 diabetic patients have the same responsiveness to drug treatment. Despite the presence of nongenetic factors (hepatic, renal, and intestinal), most of such variability is due to genetic causes. Pharmacogenomics studies have described association between single nucleotide variations and drug resistance, even though there are still conflicting results. To date, the most reliable approach to investigate allelic variants is Next-Generation Sequencing that allows the simultaneous analysis, on a genome-wide scale, of nucleotide variants and gene expression. Here, we review the relationship between drug responsiveness and polymorphisms in genes involved in drug metabolism (CYP2C9) and insulin signaling (ABCC8, KCNJ11, and PPARG). We also highlight the advancements in sequencing technologies that to date enable researchers to perform comprehensive pharmacogenomics studies. The identification of allelic variants associated with drug resistance will constitute a solid basis to establish tailored therapeutic approaches in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.	458	468	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	intestinal

Factor XIIIA (FXIIIA) levels are independent predictors of early prognosis after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and the Valine-to-Leucine (V34L) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) seems associated with lower AMI risk. Since the long-term AMI prognosis merits deeper investigation, we performed an observational study evaluating relationships between FXIIIA residual levels, cardiovascular risk-factors, and inherited genetic predispositions. FXIIIA V34L was genotyped in 333 AMI patients and a five-year follow-up was performed. FXIIIA levels assessed at day-zero (d0) and four days after AMI (d4), and conventional risk factors were analyzed, focusing on the development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). FXIIIA assessed at d0 and d4 was also an independent MACE predictor in the long-term follow-up (FXIIIA<sub>d0</sub>, Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.02, 1.79⁻5.1, <i>p</i> = 0.013; FXIIIA<sub>d4</sub>, OR = 4.46, 2.33⁻8.55, <i>p</i> = 0.0001). FXIIIA<sub>d4</sub> showed the strongest MACE association, suggesting that the FXIIIA protective role is maximized when high levels are maintained for longer time. Conversely, FXIIIA levels stratified by V34L predicted MACE at a lesser extent among L34-carriers (Hazard Risk (HR)<sub>VV34</sub> = 3.89, 2.19⁻6.87, <i>p</i> = 0.000003; HR<sub>L34-carriers</sub> = 2.78, 1.39⁻5.57, <i>p</i> = 0.0039), and V34L did not predict all MACE, only multiple-MACE occurrence (<i>p</i> = 0.0087). Finally, in survival analysis, heart failure and death differed significantly from stroke and recurrent ischemia (<i>p</i> = 0.0013), with FXIIIA levels appreciably lower in the former (<i>p</i> = 0.05). Overall, genetically-determined FXIIIA levels have a significant long-term prognostic role, suggesting that a pharmacogenetics approach might help to select those AMI patients at risk of poor prognosis in the need of dedicated treatments.	379	393	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Folate has been implicated in cardiovascular disease with atypical antipsychotic (AAPs) use, and individuals with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) variants are at greater risk. This study examined the relationship between the MTHFR 677C/T, MTHFR 1298A/C, and COMT Val158Met variants; metabolic syndrome; and lifestyle measures in schizophrenia and bipolar subjects. A total of 237 subjects with bipolar or schizophrenia receiving an antipsychotic for at least 6 months were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Subjects were screened for the metabolic syndrome (National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) and MTHFR 677C/T, MTHFR 1298A/C, and Val158Met genotypes. In addition, serum folate and homocysteine were measured along with lifestyle factors. The subject's mean age was 44.7 (SD, 11.7) years; 72% were white, and 51% male; 61% were receiving an AAP; the mean body mass index was 32.6 (SD, 8.2) kg/m, and 48% were current smokers. Overall, 41% met metabolic syndrome criteria (n = 98). There were no differences in age, sex, AAP exposure, or body mass index between genotype groups. Metabolic syndrome was related to age, smoking, and the MTHFR 677T and COMT 158Val alleles (χ = 34.4, P < 0.0001). In addition, AAP use showed a trend association with metabolic syndrome (χ = 3.21, P = 0.07). These data support our previous reports and add more data pointing to folate's role in mediating a link between mental illness and cardiovascular disease. Use of this information clinically may help to reduce the risk for AAP metabolic complications in those whose clinical care necessitates the use of AAPs.	1519	1533	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Curidium Medica, plc is a personalized medicine company intent on developing targeted medicines and their associated companion diagnostics to treat patients more effectively and safely. Through the use of its proprietary gene-expression analysis tool, Homomatrix<sup>®</sup>, Curidium aims to reveal different patient subgroups characterized by distinct underlying disease mechanisms. This is anticipated to lead to the identification of diagnostics to subclassify patients within heterogeneous disease populations and improved therapies for different patient subgroups, ultimately resulting in the development of personalized medicines using companion diagnostics and targeted treatments. The company's initial focus on diseases of the CNS has resulted in the identification of a blood diagnostic tool, PsychINDx™, which classifies patients with schizophrenia/bipolar disorder into four subgroups. PsychINDx may have the potential to improve the treatment of patients with schizophrenia/bipolar disorder. Curidium aims to continue to use this approach to improve patient treatments in a variety of therapeutic areas and heterogeneous diseases. The first such additional application using Homomatrix has been initiated within a strategic research alliance with Takeda (Osaka, Japan) in the area of major depressive disorder.	737	740	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS
In a move indicative of the enthusiastic support of precision medicine, the U.S. President Barack Obama announced the Precision Medicine Initiative in January 2015. The global precision medicine ecosystem is, thus, receiving generous support from the United States ($215 million), and numerous other governments have followed suit. In the context of precision medicine, drug treatment and prediction of its outcomes have been important for nearly six decades in the field of pharmacogenomics. The field offers an elegant solution for minimizing the effects and occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) plays an important role in this context, and it aims at specifically guiding the translation of clinically relevant and evidence-based pharmacogenomics research. In this forward-looking analysis, we make particular reference to several of the CPIC guidelines and their role in guiding the treatment of highly relevant diseases, namely cardiovascular disease, major depressive disorder, cancer, and human immunodeficiency virus, with a view to predicting and managing ADRs. In addition, we provide a list of the top 10 crosscutting opportunities and challenges facing the fields of precision medicine and pharmacogenomics, which have broad applicability independent of the drug class involved. Many of these opportunities and challenges pertain to infrastructure, study design, policy, and science culture in the early 21st century. Ultimately, rational pharmacogenomics study design and the acquisition of comprehensive phenotypic data that proportionately match the genomics data should be an imperative as we move forward toward global precision medicine.	1004	1018	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Fibrates are a medication class prescribed for decades as 'broad-spectrum' lipid-modifying agents used to lower blood triglyceride levels and raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Such lipid changes are associated with a decrease in cardiovascular disease, and fibrates are commonly used to reduce risk of dangerous cardiovascular outcomes. As with most drugs, it is well established that response to fibrate treatment is variable, and this variation is heritable. This has motivated the investigation of pharmacogenomic determinants of response, and multiple studies have discovered a number of genes associated with fibrate response. Similar to other complex traits, the interrogation of single nucleotide polymorphisms using candidate gene or genome-wide approaches has not revealed a substantial portion of response variation. However, recent innovations in technological platforms and advances in statistical methodologies are revolutionizing the use and integration of other 'omes' in pharmacogenomics studies. Here, we detail successes, challenges, and recent advances in fibrate pharmacogenomics.	246	260	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) is a key enzyme responsible for nitric oxide (NO) generation in the vascular endothelium. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by reduced NO production, and is a hallmark of cardiovascular diseases. Drugs with cardiovascular action may activate NOS3 and result in NO release and vasodilation. Moreover, genetic variations affect NOS3 expression and activity, and may partially explain the variability in the responses to cardiovascular drugs. We reviewed NO signaling and genetic effects on NO formation, and the effects of NOS3 polymorphisms, haplotypes and gene-gene interactions within NO signaling pathways on the responses to cardiovascular drugs. We discuss the role of rare NOS3 variants and further gene-gene interactions analysis for the development of novel therapies for cardiovascular diseases.	219	233	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular

I present the thesis that 'being physiological,' i.e., analyzing eating under conditions that do not perturb, or minimally perturb, the organism's endogenous processes, should be a central goal of the neuroscience of eating. I describe my understanding of 'being physiological' based on [i] the central neural-network heuristic of CNS function that traces back to Cajal and Sherrington, [ii] research on one of the simpler problems in the neuroscience of eating, identification of endocrine signals that control eating. In this context I consider natural meals, physiological doses and ranges, and antagonist studies. Several examples involve CCK. Next I describe my view of the cutting edge in the molecular neuroscience of eating as it has evolved from the discovery of leptin signaling through the application of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods. Finally I describe some novel approaches that may advance the neuroscience of eating in the foreseeable future. I conclude that [i] the neuroscience of eating may soon be able to discern 'physiological' function in the operation of CNS networks mediating eating, [ii] the neuroscience of eating should capitalize on methods developed in other areas of neuroscience, e.g., improved methods to record and manipulate CNS function in behaving animals, identification of canonical regional circuits, use of population electrophysiology, etc., and [iii] subjective aspects of eating are crucial aspects of eating science, but remain beyond mechanistic understanding.	331	334	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS

I conclude that [i] the neuroscience of eating may soon be able to discern 'physiological' function in the operation of CNS networks mediating eating, [ii] the neuroscience of eating should capitalize on methods developed in other areas of neuroscience, e.g., improved methods to record and manipulate CNS function in behaving animals, identification of canonical regional circuits, use of population electrophysiology, etc., and [iii] subjective aspects of eating are crucial aspects of eating science, but remain beyond mechanistic understanding.	1271	1274	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS
One of the ongoing issues in perinatal medicine is the risk of birth defects associated with maternal drug use. The teratogenic effect of a drug depends, apart from other factors, on the exposition of the fetus to the drug. Transporter proteins are known to be involved in the pharmacokinetics of drugs and have an effect on drug level and fetal drug exposure. This condition may subsequently alter the risk of teratogenicity, which occurs in a dose-dependent manner. This review focuses on the clinically important polymorphisms of transporter proteins and their effects on the mRNA and protein expression in placental tissue. We also propose a novel approach on how the different genotypes of the polymorphism can be translated into phenotypes to facilitate genetic association studies. The last section looks into the recent studies exploring the association between P-glycoprotein polymorphisms and the risk of fetal birth defects associated with medication use during pregnancy.	340	345	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	fetal
RECQ5, a member of the conserved RECQ helicase family, is the sole human RECQ homolog that has not been linked to a hereditary developmental syndrome. Nonetheless, dysregulation of RECQ5 has emerged as a significant clinical concern, being linked to cancer predisposition, cardiovascular disease, and inflammation. In cells, RECQ5 assumes a crucial role in the regulation of DNA repair pathways, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and inter-strand DNA crosslinks. Moreover, RECQ5 exhibits a capacity to modulate gene expression by interacting with transcription machineries and their co-regulatory proteins, thus safeguarding against transcription-induced DNA damage. This review aims to provide an overview of the multifaceted functions of RECQ5 and its implications in maintaining genomic stability. We will discuss the potential effects of clinical variants of RECQ5 on its cellular functions and their underlying mechanisms in the pathogenesis of cancer and cardiovascular disease. We will review the impact of RECQ5 variants in the field of pharmacogenomics, specifically their influence on drug responses, which may pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions targeting RECQ5 in human diseases.	273	287	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular

Clinical practice sometimes brings to face with situations quite peculiar, potentially dangerous for the patient's life. In the great majority of cases, pathologies associated with each other (cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological), while in other cases we can treat rare diseases or syndromes. It's considered exceptional the simultaneous presence of "rare" pathologies in a single patient. This exceptionality has been a push to treat a patient as a "unique" asking for help to deeper studies of pharmacogenetics. Our case reports the management of a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), undergoing a total thyroidectomy. We found several problems, and we tried to find effective solutions for the management of the patient during the whole peri-operative process, from a clinical, pharmacological and also from a surgical point of view.	193	207	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular
Due to interindividual variability in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, traditional isoniazid fixed-dose regimens may lead to suboptimal or toxic isoniazid concentrations in the plasma of patients with tuberculosis, contributing to adverse drug reactions, therapeutic failure, or the development of drug resistance. Achieving precision therapy for isoniazid requires a multifaceted approach that could integrate various clinical and genomic factors to tailor the isoniazid dose to individual patient characteristics. This includes leveraging molecular diagnostics to perform the comprehensive profiling of host pharmacogenomics to determine how it affects isoniazid metabolism, such as its metabolism by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), and studying drug-resistant mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome for enabling targeted therapy selection. Several other molecular signatures identified from the host pharmacogenomics as well as other omics-based approaches such as gut microbiome, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic approaches have provided mechanistic explanations for isoniazid pharmacokinetic variability and/or adverse drug reactions and thereby may facilitate precision therapy of isoniazid, though further validations in larger and diverse populations with tuberculosis are required for clinical applications. Therapeutic drug monitoring and population pharmacokinetic approaches allow for the adjustment of isoniazid dosages based on patient-specific pharmacokinetic profiles, optimizing drug exposure while minimizing toxicity and the risk of resistance. Current evidence has shown that with the integration of the host pharmacogenomics-particularly NAT2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomics data along with isoniazid pharmacokinetic concentrations in the blood and patient factors such as anthropometric measurements, comorbidities, and type and timing of food administered-precision therapy approaches in isoniazid therapy can be tailored to the specific characteristics of both the host and the pathogen for improving tuberculosis treatment outcomes.	983	986	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	gut
Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants' interindividual trough concentration variability affects efficacy and safety, especially in bleeding events. Rivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4/5-, CYP2J2-, and CYP-independent mechanisms and is a substrate of two transporter proteins: ABCB1 (MDR1, P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (BCRP; breast-cancer-resistance protein). The polymorphisms of these genes may possibly affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban and, consequently, its safety profile. Rivaroxaban variability may be associated with age, liver and kidney function, concomitant illness and therapy, and pharmacogenetic predisposition. This case series is the first, to our knowledge, that presents multiple risk factors for rivaroxaban-related bleeding (RRB) including age, renal function, concomitant diseases, concomitant treatment, and pharmacogenetic data. It presents patients with RRB, along with their complete clinical and pharmacogenetic data, as well as an evaluation of possible risk factors for RRB. Thirteen patients were carriers of <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>ABCG2</i>, <i>CYP2J2</i>, and/or <i>CYP3A4</i>/5 gene polymorphisms. Possible drug-drug interactions with increased bleeding risk were identified in nine patients. Six patients had eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Our data suggest a possible role of multiple factors and their interactions in predicting RRB; however, they also indicate the need for further comprehensive multidisciplinary research to enable safer use of this product based on a personalised approach.	25	44	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants
Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are commonly used to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Endorsed by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and the European Society of Cardiology, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have displaced warfarin as the OAC of choice for both conditions, due to improved safety profiles, fewer drug-drug and drug-diet interactions, and lack of monitoring requirements. Despite their widespread use and improved safety over warfarin, DOAC-related bleeding remains a major concern for patients. DOACs have stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; however, variability in DOAC response is common and may be attributed to numerous factors, including patient-specific factors, concomitant medications, comorbid conditions, and genetics. Although DOAC randomized controlled trials included patients of varying ages and levels of kidney function, they failed to include patients of diverse ancestries. Additionally, current evidence to support DOAC pharmacogenetic associations have primarily been derived from European and Asian individuals. Given differences in genotype frequencies and disease burden among patients of different biogeographic groups, future research must engage diverse populations to assess and quantify the impact of predictors on DOAC response. Current under-representation of patients from diverse racial groups does not allow for proper generalization of the influence of clinical and genetic factors in relation to DOAC variability. Herein, we discuss factors affecting DOAC response, such as age, sex, weight, kidney function, drug interactions, and pharmacogenetics, while offering a new perspective on the need for further research including frequently excluded groups.	274	293	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants

Behçet disease (BD) is an enigmatic inflammatory disorder with multisystemic complications which is endemic in some countries but can be seen in the entire world. Valid diagnostic criteria are available. The pathology is related to a specific perivasculitis with involvement of both arteries and veins of all sizes. Minor arterial and cardiac involvement is frequent in BD but is usually asymptomatic. In exceptional cases cardiac symptoms may be the 1st manifestation of BD. The prevalence of severe cardiac complications (cardio-Behçet) should be < 10%. An impressive therapeutic improvement has been achieved by using appropriate catheterization techniques, coronary and intra-arterial stents, colchicine, drug-response modifying drugs and immunotherapy but, still cardio-Behçet has a poor prognosis. Efforts are undertaken to improve morbidity and prognosis with the use of newer drugs. An important part of the complications in BD are related to the frequent thromboembolic complications and there is high possibility that newer oral anticoagulants will be superior to the classical anticoagulants presently used. Available biologic agents have already been frequently used and seem to have improved the prognosis, but efforts are undertaken to find newer biologic agents with better therapeutic performance and less side-effects. Summarizing as much as possible the effects of the presently used biotherapy in BD, interferon-alpha is effective against many ocular, genital and perhaps vascular manifestations, but its effectiveness is limited by frequent adverse-effects (even if not dangerous for the cardiovascular system). Infliximab is a valid option in the therapy of ocular and cutaneous manifestations but it is less convincing in the therapy of vascular manifestations in vascular- and neuro-Behçet; furthermore, side-effects, including severe cardiovascular complications, are seen in a minority of patients; perhaps worse, infliximab seems to loose efficacy in the long-term therapy, while pharmacogenetics and receptor polymorphism may explain the existence of non-responders and the occurrence of resistance. Adalimumab might be a promising alternative for infliximab and seems to exert a good effect in an eurysmatic and other vascular complications. However, we lack long-term studies. Other biologic agents have been used only in few cases and it is too early to say if they offer new therapeutic perspectives.	1034	1053	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants
Current strategies to treat type 2 diabetes (DMT2) include reducing insulin resistance using glitazones, supplementing with exogenous insulin, increasing endogenous insulin production with sulfonylureas and meglitinides, reducing hepatic glucose production through biguanides, and limiting postprandial glucose absorption with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. In all of these areas, new generations of molecules with improved efficacy and safety profiles, are being investigated. Promising biological targets are rapidly emerging such as the role of lipotoxicity as a cause of glucometabolic insulin resistance, leading to a host of new molecular drug targets such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators, recombinant adiponectin derivatives, and fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitors. Insulin action can be enhanced in muscle, liver and fat, with small-molecule activators of the insulin receptor or inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase (FTP)-IB. Defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic B-cells could be alleviated with recombinant glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) or agonists to the GLP-1 receptor. This review presents a new approach for obesity and DMT2 drug discovery through pharmacogenomics. Several compounds have already been validated through genetic engineering in animal models or the preliminary use of therapeutic compounds in humans.	290	310	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	postprandial glucose
The associations between plasma letrozole concentrations and CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genetic variants were tested in the Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenomics (ELPH) trial. ELPH is a multicenter, open-label prospective clinical trial in women randomly assigned (n≈250 in each arm) to receive 2 years of treatment with either oral letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or oral exemestane (25 mg/day). CYP2A6 and CYP3A showed effects on letrozole metabolism in vitro. DNA samples were genotyped for variants in the CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genes. Plasma letrozole concentrations showed high interpatient variability (>10-fold) and were associated significantly with CYP2A6 genotypes (P<0.0001), body mass index (BMI) (P<0.0001), and age (P=0.0035). However, CYP3A5 genotypes showed no association with plasma letrozole concentrations. These data suggest that CYP2A6 is the principal clearance mechanism for letrozole in vivo. CYP2A6 metabolic status, along with BMI and age, may serve as a biomarker of the efficacy of letrozole treatment or a predictor of adverse effects.	323	337	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral letrozole

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective controller medications for asthma, and variability in ICS response is associated with genetic variation. Despite ICS treatment, some patients with poor asthma control experience severe asthma exacerbations, defined as a hospitalization or emergency room visit. We hypothesized that some individuals may be at increased risk of asthma exacerbations, despite ICS use, due to genetic factors. A GWAS of 237,726 common, independent markers was conducted in 806 Caucasian asthmatic patients from two population-based biobanks: BioVU, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) in Tennessee (369 patients), and Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP) at the Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin (437 patients). Using a case-control study design, the association of each SNP locus with the outcome of asthma exacerbations (defined as asthma-related emergency department visits or hospitalizations concurrent with oral corticosteroid use), was evaluated for each population by logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age, gender and the first four principal components. A meta-analysis of the results was conducted. Validation of expression of selected candidate genes was determined by evaluating an independent microarray expression data set. Our study identified six novel SNPs associated with differential risk of asthma exacerbations (P < 10(-05)). The top GWAS result, rs2395672 in CMTR1, was associated with an increased risk of exacerbations in both populations (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11; joint P = 2.3 × 10(-06)). Two SNPs (rs2395672 and rs279728) were associated with increased risk of exacerbations, while the remaining four SNPs (rs4271056, rs6467778, rs2691529, and rs9303988) were associated with decreased risk. Three SNPs (rs2395672, rs6467778, and rs2691529) were present in three genes: CMTR1, TRIM24 and MAGI2. The CMTR1 mRNA transcript was significantly differentially expressed in nasal lavage samples from asthmatics during acute exacerbations, suggesting potential involvement of this gene in the development of this phenotype. We show that genetic variability may contribute to asthma exacerbations in patients taking ICS. Furthermore, our studies implicate CMTR1 as a novel candidate gene with potential roles in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations.	963	982	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral corticosteroid
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a silent progressive polygenic metabolic disorder resulting from ineffective insulin cascading in the body. World-wide, about 415 million people are suffering from T2DM with a projected rise to 642 million in 2040. T2DM is treated with several classes of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) viz. biguanides, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, etc. Treatment strategies for T2DM are to minimize long-term micro and macro vascular complications by achieving an optimized glycemic control. Genetic variations in the human genome not only disclose the risk of T2DM development but also predict the personalized response to drug therapy. Inter-individual variability in response to OADs is due to polymorphisms in genes encoding drug receptors, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes for example, genetic variants in solute carrier transporters (SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A3, SLC47A1 and SLC47A2) are actively involved in glycemic/HbA1c management of metformin. In addition, CYP gene encoding Cytochrome P450 enzymes also play a crucial role with respect to metabolism of drugs. Pharmacogenetic studies provide insights on the relationship between individual genetic variants and variable therapeutic outcomes of various OADs. Clinical utility of pharmacogenetic study is to predict the therapeutic dose of various OADs on individual basis. Pharmacogenetics therefore, is a step towards personalized medicine which will greatly improve the efficacy of diabetes treatment.	290	294	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
Metformin is a first-line oral antidiabetic agent that has shown additional effects in treating obesity and metabolic syndrome. Inter-individual variability in metformin response could be partially explained by the genetic component. Here, we aimed to test whether common genetic variants can predict the response to metformin intervention in obese children. The study was a multicenter and double-blind randomized controlled trial that was stratified according to sex and pubertal status in 160 children with obesity. Children were randomly assigned to receive either metformin (1g/d) or placebo for six months after meeting the defined inclusion criteria. We conducted a post hoc genotyping study in 124 individuals (59 placebo, 65 treated) comprising finally 231 genetic variants in candidate genes. We provide evidence for 28 common variants as promising pharmacogenetics regulators of metformin response in terms of a wide range of anthropometric and biochemical outcomes, including body mass index (BMI) Z-score, and glucose, lipid, and inflammatory traits. Although no association remained statistically significant after multiple-test correction, our findings support previously reported variants in metformin transporters or targets as well as identify novel and promising loci, such as the <i>ADYC3</i> and the <i>BDNF</i> genes, with plausible biological relation to the metformin's action mechanism.

Kinetics-based dose targeting is often conducted in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients conditioned with intravenous (IV) or oral busulfan to lower rates of rejection, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse. Using the candidate gene approach, the authors evaluated whether busulfan clearance was associated with polymorphisms in the genes regulating the predominant metabolizing enzymes involved in busulfan conjugation, specifically glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoenzymes A1 (GSTA1) and M1 (GSTM1). Busulfan clearance was estimated after the morning dose on days 1, 2, and 3; each patient's average clearance was used for analyses. The average (± standard deviation) busulfan clearance was 3.2 ± 0.56 mL/min/kg in the separate population of 95 patients who received oral busulfan and 103 ± 24 ml/min/m(2) in the 57 patients who received IV busulfan. Oral busulfan clearance was associated with GSTA1 (P = .008) but not GSTM1 (P = .57) genotypes. However, among the GSTA1 haplotypes (ie, *A*A, *A*B, *B*B), there was significant overlap in the observed oral busulfan clearance and similar rates of achieving the target busulfan exposure. Clearance of IV busulfan was not associated with GSTA1 (P = .21) or GSTM1 (P = .99). These data suggest that personalizing either IV or oral busulfan dosing cannot be simplified on the basis of GSTA1 or GSTM1 genotype.	134	147	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral busulfan

The CYP2C9 enzyme metabolizes a wide range of relevant drugs, among which are oral anticoagulants. VKORC1 is the pharmacodynamic target of the oral anticoagulants. The genetic polymorphisms CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 -1639 G>A are the major determinants of the inter-individual variability in the dosage requirements of oral anticoagulants. This study provides a first evaluation of these 3 polymorphisms in a Romanian population. A total of 332 Romanian individuals were genotyped for the CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphisms using the PCR-RFLP technique. Sixty-two individuals (18.7%) were heterozygous for CYP2C9*2, whereas 47 individuals (14.1%) were heterozygous for CYP2C9*3. Fourteen individuals (4.2%) had a CYP2C9*2 homozygous, CYP2C9*3 homozygous or CYP2C9*2/CYP2C9*3 compound heterozygous genotype. These individuals are predicted to have the lowest CYP2C9 enzymatic activity. The allele frequencies of the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms were 11.3% and 9.3% respectively. For the VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism, there were 170 heterozygotes (51.2%) and 55 (16.6%) homozygotes for the A allele. The frequency of the A allele was 42.2%. Overall, the distribution of the CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphisms observed in our cohort is in accordance with other Caucasian populations. A large number of Romanians are expected to harbour at least one CYP2C9 variant allele and/or one VKORC1 -1639 G>A allele. This frequency has major implications in the pharmacogenomics of oral anticoagulants in Romanians.	78	97	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants

A total of 332 Romanian individuals were genotyped for the CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphisms using the PCR-RFLP technique. Sixty-two individuals (18.7%) were heterozygous for CYP2C9*2, whereas 47 individuals (14.1%) were heterozygous for CYP2C9*3. Fourteen individuals (4.2%) had a CYP2C9*2 homozygous, CYP2C9*3 homozygous or CYP2C9*2/CYP2C9*3 compound heterozygous genotype. These individuals are predicted to have the lowest CYP2C9 enzymatic activity. The allele frequencies of the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms were 11.3% and 9.3% respectively. For the VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism, there were 170 heterozygotes (51.2%) and 55 (16.6%) homozygotes for the A allele. The frequency of the A allele was 42.2%. Overall, the distribution of the CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphisms observed in our cohort is in accordance with other Caucasian populations. A large number of Romanians are expected to harbour at least one CYP2C9 variant allele and/or one VKORC1 -1639 G>A allele. This frequency has major implications in the pharmacogenomics of oral anticoagulants in Romanians.	323	342	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants
The CYP2C9 enzyme metabolizes a wide range of relevant drugs, among which are oral anticoagulants. VKORC1 is the pharmacodynamic target of the oral anticoagulants.

The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment has improved our understanding and management of complex pharmacological issues that have driven improved outcomes and quality of life of the HIV-infected patient. These issues include adherence, long- and short-term toxicities, pharmacoenhancement, pharmacogenomics, therapeutic drug monitoring, differential penetration of drugs into sanctuary sites, such as the central nervous system, genital tract and small bowel, and drug-drug and drug-food interactions related to cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferases and drug transporters, to name a few. There is future promise, as an increased understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HIV and global public health initiatives are driving novel treatment approaches with goals to prevent, control and, ultimately, eradicate HIV.	451	464	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	genital tract
To provide the best patient care related to medication administration and prescription, an understanding of the specific enzymes is essential. Enzymes affect the metabolizing of most medications that nurses administer and that nurse practitioners and physicians prescribe on a regular basis. More specifically, the most important p450 enzymes in drug metabolism are cytochrome p450 (CYP) 1A2, the CYP2C family, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In addition, the enzymes are instrumental in the body's reaction to environmental factors, some of which are carcinogens.	480	484	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	body
Human cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) accounts for approximately 20% of total hepatic CYP content and metabolizes approximately 15% clinically used drugs including S-warfarin, tolbutamide, phenytoin, losartan, diclofenac, and celecoxib. To date, there are at least 33 variants of CYP2C9 (*1B through to *34) being identified. CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 differ from the wild-type CYP2C9*1 by a single point mutation: CYP2C9*2 is characterised by a 430C>T exchange in exon 3 resulting in an Arg144Cys amino acid substitution, whereas CYP2C9*3 shows an exchange of 1075A>C in exon 7 causing an Ile359Leu substitution in the catalytic site of the enzyme. CYP2C9*2 is frequent among Caucasians with approximately 1% of the population being homozygous carriers and 22% heterozygous. The corresponding figures for the CYP2C9*3 allele are 0.4% and 15%, respectively. Worldwide, a number of other variants have also to be considered. The CYP2C9 polymorphisms are relevant for the efficacy and adverse effects of numerous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, sulfonylurea antidiabetic drugs and, most critically, oral anticoagulants belonging to the class of vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitors. Numerous clinical studies have shown that the CYP2C9 polymorphism should be considered in warfarin therapy and practical algorithms how to consider it in therapy are available. These studies have highlighted the importance of the CYP2C9*2 and *3 alleles. Warfarin has served as a practical example of how pharmacogenetics can be utilized to achieve maximum efficacy and minimum toxicity. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 have the potential to affect the toxicity of CYP2C9 drugs with somewhat lower therapeutic indices such as warfarin, phenytoin, and certain antidiabetic drugs. CYP2C9 is one of the clinically significant drug metabolising enzymes that demonstrates genetic variants with significant phenotype and clinical outcomes. Genetic testing of CYP2C9 is expected to have a role in predicting drug clearance and implementing individualized pharmacotherapy. Prospective clinical studies with large samples are required to establish gene-dose and gene-effect relatiohsips for CYP2C9.	1097	1116	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants

Clozapine is primarily metabolized via cytochrome P450(CYP)1A2 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Metabolic inhibitors of clozapine, such as fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin, are important to recognize to avoid adverse drug events. Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives (eOCPs) are weaker CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 inhibitors but are associated with a 2-fold increase of clozapine concentrations. The potential for phenoconversion due to a CYP genetic polymorphism can add additional complexities when considering drug interactions. A case report is presented of a suspected interaction between newly initiated clozapine and a prescribed eOCP for which the patient's pharmacogenomic status was known. A 17-year-old, nonsmoking, White female with a history of schizophrenia was initiated on clozapine 12.5 mg at bedtime with a plan to increase by 25 mg every 4 days in the outpatient setting. The patient was a known rapid CYP1A2 metabolizer without identified sources of CYP1A2 induction and a CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer. Based on pharmacogenomic testing, there was no suspicion for significant gene-drug interactions. Yet, as the patient was prescribed an eOCP, a clozapine concentration was obtained after reaching 150 mg at bedtime. This steady-state clozapine concentration was found to be 560 ng/mL, correlating with worsening sedation and constipation. Given ongoing side effects, clozapine was lowered to 100 mg at bedtime; however, ongoing intolerance ultimately led to clozapine discontinuation. This case highlights the potential interaction between clozapine and eOCP in a CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer, leading to clozapine intolerance and discontinuation. The concomitant use of clozapine and eOCPs should be undertaken judiciously.	266	285	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral contraceptives
The objective of this prospective study was to examine the exposure to the main active metabolites of ciprofloxacin in critically ill patients and to examine the factors (demographic, laboratory and genetic) that could potentially affect the drug metabolic conversion of ciprofloxacin. The secondary aim was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for the metabolite showing the most associations with the abovementioned factors. A total of 29 patients were treated with intravenous infusion of ciprofloxacin and enrolled on this trial. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken at 1, 4, and 11.5 h following the completion of the infusion. Sex, age, body weight, height, serum creatinine and bilirubin levels, and creatinine clearance (CL<sub>CR</sub>) were recorded, and polymorphisms rs2032582 and rs1045642 in the <i>ABCB1</i> gene, rs4148977 in the <i>SLCO1A2</i> gene and rs762551 in the <i>CYP1A2</i> gene were analyzed. A three-stage parent drug-metabolite population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Median (IQR) metabolite/parent ratios of the desethylene ciprofloxacin, formyl ciprofloxacin and oxociprofloxacin were 5.86 (4.09-9.87)%, 4.08 (3.38-6.92)% and 5.91 (3.42-13.65)%, respectively. The desethylene ciprofloxacin metabolic ratio was positively associated with height (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2277, <i>p</i> = 0.0089) and CL<sub>CR</sub> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2023, <i>p</i> = 0.0144) and negatively associated with age (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2227, <i>p</i> = 0.0112). Males had a significantly higher oxociprofloxacin metabolic ratio than females (9.14 vs 3.42%, <i>p</i> = 0.0043). In the desethylene ciprofloxacin population PK model, the volume of distribution decreased with age, the parent drug-metabolite transfer rate constant increased with CL<sub>CR</sub>, and the metabolite elimination rate constant decreased with age and is increased in <i>CYP1A2</i> rs762551 variant allele carriers. We therefore hypothesized that the CYP1A2 inhibition by ciprofloxacin is mediated by its metabolite desethylene ciprofloxacin.	669	673	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	body

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious adverse effect of long-term antipsychotic use. Because of genetic susceptibility for developing TD and because it is difficult to predict and prevent its development prior to or during the early stages of medication, pharmacogenetic research of TD is important. Additionally, these studies enhance our knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying abnormal dyskinetic movements, such as Parkinson's disease. However, the pathophysiology of TD remains unclear. The oxidative stress hypothesis of TD is one of the possible pathophysiologic models for TD. Preclinical and clinical studies of the oxidative stress hypothesis of TD indicate that neurotoxic free radical production is likely a consequence of antipsychotic medication and is related to the occurrence of TD. Several studies on TD have focused on examining the genes involved in oxidative stress. Among them, manganese superoxide dismutase gene Ala-9Val polymorphisms show a relatively consistent association with TD susceptibility, although not all studies support this. Numerous pharmacogenetic studies have found a positive relationship between TD and oxidative stress based on genes involved in the antioxidant defense mechanism, dopamine turnover and metabolism, and other antioxidants such as estrogen and melatonin. However, many of the positive findings have not been replicated. We expect that more research will be needed to address these issues.	425	436	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	Parkinson's
Warfarin has a long record of safe and effective clinical use, and it remains one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic conditions even in the era of direct oral anticoagulants. To address its large interindividual variability and narrow therapeutic window, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium has recommended using pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms, such as the ones developed by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC) and by Gage et al, to dose warfarin when genotype information is available. In China, dosing algorithms based on local patient populations have been developed and evaluated for predictive accuracy of warfarin maintenance doses. In this study, percentage deviations of doses predicted by 15 Chinese dosing algorithms from that by IWPC and Gage algorithms were systematically evaluated to understand the differences between Chinese and Western algorithms. In general, dose predictions by Chinese dosing algorithms tended to be lower than those predicted by IWPC or Gage algorithms for the most prevalent VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes in the Chinese population. The extent of negative prediction deviation appeared to be largest in the younger age group with smaller body weight. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that Asians have a higher sensitivity to warfarin and require lower doses than Western populations.	208	227	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants

The primary aim of the present study was to assess the possible associations between dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic system-related genes and adverse events after antipsychotic treatment in paranoid schizophrenia patients. The second aim of the study was to compare the intensity of these symptoms between atypical (ziprasidone and olanzapine) and typical (perazine) antipsychotic drugs. One-hundred and ninety-one Polish patients suffering from paranoid schizophrenia were genotyped for polymorphisms of DRD2, DAT1, COMT, MAOA, SERT, 5HT2A, and GRIK3. The patients were randomized to treatment with perazine, olanzapine or ziprasidone monotherapy for 3 months. The intensity of side effects (changes in body weights and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)) was measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. After 3 months of therapy, the weight increase was the greatest in the group treated with olanzapine and the least in the group treated with ziprasidone. None of the examined gene polymorphisms was associated with the body weight changes. Perazine treatment was associated with the significantly highest intensity of EPS. None of the examined polymorphisms was associated with the changes in extrapyramidal adverse events after antipsychotic treatment. The selected polymorphisms are not primarily involved in changes in body weights and EPS related to antipsychotic treatment in paranoid schizophrenia patients.	1056	1060	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	body

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and oral fluoropyrimidines, such as capecitabine, are widely used in the treatment of cancer, especially gastrointestinal tumors and breast cancer, but their administration can produce serious and even lethal toxicity. This toxicity is often related to the partial or complete deficiency of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme, which causes a reduction in clearance and a longer half-life of 5-FU. It is advisable to determine if a DPD deficiency exists before administering these drugs by genotyping DPYD gene polymorphisms. The objective of this consensus of experts, in which representatives from the Spanish Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Society and the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology participated, is to establish clear recommendations for the implementation of genotype and/or phenotype testing for DPD deficiency in patients who are candidates to receive fluoropyrimidines. The genotyping of DPYD previous to treatment classifies individuals as normal, intermediate, or poor metabolizers. Normal metabolizers do not require changes in the initial dose, intermediate metabolizers should start treatment with fluoropyrimidines at doses reduced to 50%, and poor metabolizers are contraindicated for fluoropyrimidines.	26	48	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral fluoropyrimidines
One of the major goals of pharmacogenetics is to elucidate mechanisms and identify patients at increased risk of adverse events (AEs). To date, however, there have been only a few successful examples of this type of approach. In this paper, we describe a retrospective case-control pharmacogenetic study of an AE of unknown mechanism, characterized by elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) during long-term treatment with the oral direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran. The study was based on 74 cases and 130 treated controls and included both a genome-wide tag single nucleotide polymorphism and large-scale candidate gene analysis. A strong genetic association between elevated ALAT and the MHC alleles DRB1(*)07 and DQA1(*)02 was discovered and replicated, suggesting a possible immune pathogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, immunological studies suggest that ximelagatran may have the ability to act as a contact sensitizer, and hence be able to stimulate an adaptive immune response.	445	449	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
The aim of this analysis was to create a pharmacometric model of efavirenz developmental pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics in HIV-infected children. The data consisted of 3,172 plasma concentrations from 96 HIV-1-infected children who participated in the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group 382 (PACTG382) study. Analyses were performed using NONMEM, and the impacts of body weight, age, race, sex, formulation, liver function, and cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6)-G516T and multidrug-resistance transporter gene (MDR1)-C3435T polymorphisms were assessed. A one-compartment model using weight-based allometry on oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution adequately described the data. A sigmoid maximum-effect (Emax) maturation model demonstrated an increase in oral clearance with age to reach 90% of its mature level by the age of 9 months. The liquid formulation bioavailability relative to the capsule was found to increase with age to reach 90% of its mature value by the age of 8 years. The CYP2B6-G516T polymorphism decreased oral clearance, while the MDR1-C3435T polymorphism demonstrated no effect.	375	379	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	body

TNF-α inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy both as monotherapy and in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the treatment of chronic inflammatory immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis (Ps) and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and may be administered off-label to treat disseminated granuloma annulare, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. There are several TNF-α inhibitors available for clinical use including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept. In this article, we discuss the efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of spondyloarthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Etanercept is effective in the treatment of PsA, AS, JIA and uveitis. Independent predictors of achieving a sustained clinical improvement or MDA in children with JIA include shorter disease duration, no concurrent oral corticosteroid use, history of chronic anterior uveitis and age <9 years. IBD incidence was lower in patients receiving etanercept plus MTX. Intra-articular administration of etanercept seems to favor a prompt target joint improvement without serious adverse events. Etanercept improve endothelial function reducing the risk of acute cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events.

The scaling up of data in clinical pharmacology and the merger of systems biology and pharmacology has led to the emergence of a new discipline of Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP). This new research direction might significantly advance the discovery, development, and clinical use of therapeutic drugs. Research communities from computational biology, systems biology, and biological engineering--working collaboratively with pharmacologists, geneticists, biochemists, and analytical chemists--are creating and modeling large data on drug effects that is transforming our understanding of how these drugs work at a network level. In this review, we highlight developments in a new and rapidly growing field--pharmacometabolomics--in which large biochemical data-capturing effects of genome, gut microbiome, and environment exposures is revealing information about metabotypes and treatment outcomes, and creating metabolic signatures as new potential biomarkers. Pharmacometabolomics informs and complements pharmacogenomics and together they provide building blocks for QSP.	803	806	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	gut

The impact of drug transporters on drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics has been increasingly recognized in recent years. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the ABCB1 (formerly MDR1) gene, is among the most well-characterized drug transporters, particularly in veterinary medicine. P-gp is expressed by a variety of normal tissues, including the intestines, brain capillary endothelial cells, renal tubular cells, and biliary canalicular cells, where it functions to actively extrude substrate drugs. In this capacity, P-gp limits oral absorption and central nervous system entry of many substrate drugs and enhances their excretion from the body. Many drugs used in veterinary medicine are substrates for P-gp, including many chemotherapeutic agents and macrocyclic lactones (avermectins and milbemycin). A 4-base pair deletion mutation in the ABCB1 gene occurs in many herding breed dogs, including collies, Australian shepherds, and Shetland sheepdogs. The mutation (ABCB1-1Delta) renders affected animals extremely susceptible to toxicosis induced by substrate drugs, such as the macrocyclic lactones at doses well below those tolerated by dogs with the wild-type ABCB1 gene. However, at the manufacturer's recommended dose, all FDA-approved heartworm preventive products marketed in the United States are safe, even for dogs with the ABCB1 mutant/mutant genotype.	540	544	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
Pharmacomicrobiomics and toxicomicrobiomics study how variations within the human microbiome (the combination of human-associated microbial communities and their genomes) affect drug disposition, action, and toxicity. These emerging fields, interconnecting microbiology, bioinformatics, systems pharmacology, and toxicology, complement pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics, expanding the scope of precision medicine. Areas covered: This article reviews some of the most recently reported pharmacomicrobiomic and toxicomicrobiomic interactions. Examples include the impact of the human gut microbiota on cardiovascular drugs, natural products, and chemotherapeutic agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although the gut microbiota has been the most extensively studied, some key drug-microbiome interactions involve vaginal, intratumoral, and environmental bacteria, and are briefly discussed here. Additionally, computational resources, moving the field from cataloging to predicting interactions, are introduced. Expert opinion: The rapid pace of discovery triggered by the Human Microbiome Project is moving pharmacomicrobiomic research from scattered observations to systematic studies focusing on screening microbiome variants against different drug classes. Better representation of all human populations will improve such studies by avoiding sampling bias, and the integration of multiomic studies with designed experiments will allow establishing causation. In the near future, pharmacomicrobiomic testing is expected to be a key step in screening novel drugs and designing precision therapeutics.	724	727	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	gut
Priapism is a urologic emergency representing a true disorder of penile erection that persists beyond or is unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation. A variety of psychotropic drugs are known to produce priapism, albeit rarely, through their antagonistic action on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. We report such a case of priapism induced by a single oral dose of 10 mg aripiprazole, a drug with the least affinity to adrenergic receptors among all atypical antipsychotics. Polymorphism of alpha-2A adrenergic receptor gene in schizophrenia patients is known to be associated with sialorrhea while on clozapine treatment. Probably, similar polymorphism of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor gene could contribute to its altered sensitivity and resultant priapism. In future, pharmacogenomics-based approach may help in personalizing the treatment and effectively prevent the emergence of such side effects.	65	71	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	penile

In future, pharmacogenomics-based approach may help in personalizing the treatment and effectively prevent the emergence of such side effects.	352	356	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
The proven therapeutic efficacy of methadone in cancer pain is hindered by a challenging pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile, considerable interpatient variation, and increasing concern about the complexities of dosing. The objective of this study was to assess the evidence for the use of methadone in cancer pain management. The authors conducted a systematic literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published post the 2007 Cochrane review of methadone in cancer pain. Trial quality was assessed using the Oxford Quality Scoring System and Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Of the 152 abstracts found, 4 were RCTs (272 participants). Two RCTs compared the efficacy and safety of methadone with placebo or active control and two investigated rotation to methadone from other opioids. The studies used different routes of administration, dosing, initiation, and titration of methadone and distinct pain scoring tools and did not address the issues raised by the Cochrane review. Methadone has an important role in the management of cancer pain, with many advantages including low cost, high oral bioavailability, rapid onset of action, once-daily dosing, and postulated benefits in difficult pain control scenarios. However, due to limited research in this area, methadone dosing remains a challenge, with vigilant dose initiation, adjustment, and monitoring required. There is a need for further studies using standardized methodology to evaluate the optimal dosing strategy of methadone, the effect on different types of pain, and the role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics in clinical outcomes.	1138	1142	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
<b>Background:</b> Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are a major clinical problem accounting for significant hospital admission rates, morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. One-third of people with diabetes experience at least one ADR. However, there is notable interindividual heterogeneity resulting in patient harm and unnecessary medical costs. Genomics is at the forefront of research to understand interindividual variability, and there are many genotype-drug response associations in diabetes with inconsistent findings. Here, we conducted a systematic review to comprehensively examine and synthesize the effect of genetic polymorphisms on the incidence of ADRs of oral glucose-lowering drugs in people with type 2 diabetes. <b>Methods:</b> A literature search was made to identify articles that included specific results of research on genetic polymorphism and adverse effects associated with oral glucose-lowering drugs. The electronic search was carried out on 3rd October 2020, through Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science using keywords and MeSH terms. <b>Result:</b> Eighteen articles consisting of 10, 383 subjects were included in this review. Carriers of reduced-function alleles of organic cation transporter 1 (OCT 1, encoded by <i>SLC22A1</i>) or reduced expression alleles of plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT, encoded by <i>SLC29A4</i>) or serotonin transporter (SERT, encoded by <i>SLC6A4</i>) were associated with increased incidence of metformin-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects. These effects were shown to exacerbate by concomitant treatment with gut transporter inhibiting drugs. The CYP2C9 alleles, <sup>*</sup> <i>2</i> (rs1799853C>T) and <sup>*</sup> <i>3</i> (rs1057910A>C) that are predictive of low enzyme activity were more common in subjects who experienced hypoglycemia after treatment with sulfonylureas. However, there was no significant association between sulfonylurea-related hypoglycemia and genetic variants in the ATP-binding cassette transporter sub-family C member 8 (<i>ABCC8</i>)<i>/</i>Potassium Inwardly Rectifying Channel Subfamily J Member 11 (<i>KCNJ11)</i>. Compared to the wild type, the low enzyme activity C allele at CYP2C8<sup>*</sup> <i>3</i> (rs1057910A>C) was associated with less weight gain whereas the C allele at rs6123045 in the <i>NFATC2</i> gene was significantly associated with edema from rosiglitazone treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> In spite of limited studies investigating genetics and ADR in diabetes, some convincing results are emerging. Genetic variants in genes encoding drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes are implicated in metformin-related GI adverse effects, and sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia, respectively. Further studies to investigate newer antidiabetic drugs such as DPP-4i, GLP-1RA, and SGLT2i are warranted. In addition, pharmacogenetic studies that account for race and ethnic differences are required.	675	679	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral

Eslicarbazepine acetate is a third-generation anti-epileptic prodrug quickly and extensively transformed to eslicarbazepine after oral administration. Reduction in seizure frequency in patients managed with eslicarbazepine is only partial in the majority of patients and many of them suffer considerable ADRs that require a change of treatment. The P-glycoprotein, encoded by the ABCB1 gene, is expressed throughout the body and can impact the pharmacokinetics of several drugs. In terms of epilepsy treatment, this transporter was linked to drug-resistant epilepsy, as it conditions drug access into the brain due to its expression at the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of three ABCB1 common polymorphisms (i.e., C3435T, or rs1045642, G2677A or rs2032582 and C1236T or rs1128503) in the pharmacokinetics and safety of eslicarbazepine. For this purpose, 22 healthy volunteers participating in a bioequivalence clinical trial were recruited. No significant relationship was observed between sex, race and ABCB1 polymorphism and eslicarbazepine pharmacokinetic variability. In contrast, ABCB1 C1236T C/C diplotype was significantly related to the occurrence of ADRs: one volunteer with this genotype suffered dizziness, somnolence and hand paresthesia, while no other volunteer suffered any of these ADRs (p < 0.045). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study published to date evaluating eslicarbazepine pharmacogenetics. Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to compare the results obtained here.	130	134	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic pathology affecting the Central Nervous System characterized by inflammatory processes that lead to demyelination and neurodegeneration. In MS treatment, disease modifying therapies (DMTs) are essential to reduce disease progression by suppressing the inflammatory response responsible for promoting lesion formation. Recently, in addition to the classical injectable DMTs like Interferons and Glatiramer acetate, new orally administered drugs have been approved for MS therapy: dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide and fingolimod. These drugs act with different mechanisms on the immune system, in order to suppress the harmful inflammatory process. An additional layer of complexity is introduced by the influence of polymorphic gene variants in the Human Leukocyte Antigen region on the risk of developing MS and its progression. To date, pharmacogenomic studies have mainly focused on the patient's response following admission of injectable drugs. Therefore, greater consideration must be made to pharmacogenomics with a view to developing more effective and personalized therapies. This review aims to shed light on the mechanism of action of the new oral drugs dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide and fingolimod, taking into account both the importance of immunogenetics in drug response and pharmacogenomic studies.	1190	1194	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral

Dabigatran is a novel direct oral anticoagulant agent, whose plasma concentration is closely related to bleeding risk. Genetic polymorphisms can affect the level of plasma dabigatran. The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between dabigatran-related genes and the plasma level of dabigatran in healthy Chinese subjects after taking a single oral dose. This study was performed with a single-center, single-dose, randomized, open-label, and four-period crossover trial design under both fasting and fed conditions. A total of 106 eligible healthy subjects were enrolled in the study and 104 were genotyped. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare pharmacokinetic parameters among different genotypes and linear regression was applied to explore the multiplicative interaction between variables. In this study, we found that the genotype frequencies of CES1 rs2244613 and CES1 rs8192935 were significantly different between Chinese and Caucasians, but the genotype frequencies of ABCB1 rs1045642 and ABCB1 rs4148738 were similar in both populations. CES1 rs8192935 were associated with the peak concentration of dabigatran. There was no significant gender difference in the exposure level of dabigatran. Furthermore, food significantly delayed the absorption of dabigatran but had little effect on C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-∞</sub>.	363	367	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
<b>Introduction:</b> Bleeding is one of the most undesirable complications of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). While the ryanodine receptor (<i>RYR2</i>) has been related to cardiac diseases, research on bleeding complications is lacking. This study aimed to elucidate the association between <i>RYR2</i> and bleeding risk to develop the risk scoring system in patients treated with DOACs. <b>Methods:</b> This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected samples. We selected ten SNPs within the <i>RYR2</i> gene, and two models were constructed (Model I: demographic factors only, Model II: demographic and genetic factors) in multivariable analysis. Independent risk factors for bleeding were used to develop a risk scoring system. <b>Results:</b> A total of 447 patients were included, and 49 experienced either major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding. In Model I, patients using rivaroxaban and experiencing anemia exhibited an increased bleeding risk after adjusting for covariates. Upon incorporating genetic factors into Model I, a significant association with bleeding was also observed in cases of overdosing on DOACs and in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min, in addition to rivaroxaban and anemia (Model II). Among genetic factors, <i>RYR2</i> rs12594 GG, rs17682073 AA, rs3766871 GG, and rs6678625 T alleles were associated with bleeding complications. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of Model I was 0.670, whereas that of Model II increased to 0.803, demonstrating better performance with the inclusion of genetic factors. Using the significant variables in Model II, a risk scoring system was constructed. The predicted bleeding risks for scores of 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and 9-10 points were 0%, 1.2%, 4.6%, 15.7%, 41.7%, and 73.3%, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study revealed an association between <i>RYR2</i> and bleeding complications among patients taking DOACs and established a risk scoring system to support individualized DOAC treatment for these patients.	85	104	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants
To investigate the role of IRS1 locus on failure to oral antidiabetes drugs (OADs) we genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2943641, rs7578326 (tagging all SNPs genome-wide associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related traits at this locus) and rs1801278 (that is, the loss-of-function IRS1 G972R amino acid substitution) in 2662 patients with T2D. Although no association with OAD failure was observed for rs2943641 and rs7578326 SNPs (odds ratio (OR): 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.16 and OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.87-1.09 respectively), a significant association was observed for rs1801278 (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08-1.66). When meta-analyzed with previous published data, an allelic OR of 1.41 (1.15-1.72; P=0.001) was obtained, so that homozygous R972R individuals have >80% higher risk of failing to OADs as compared with their G972G counterparts. In all, though further studies are needed for confirming this finding, our present data point to IRS1 rs1801278 as a potential biomarker for pursuing the goal of stratified medicine in the field of antihyperglycemic treatment in T2D.	52	56	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
Combination therapy with three drug regimens for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection significantly suppresses the viral replication. However, this therapeutic impact is restricted by adverse drug events and response in terms of short and long term efficacy. There are multiple factors involved in different responses to antiretrovirals (ARVs) such as age, body weight, disease status, diet and heredity. Pharmacogenomics deals with individual genetic make-up and its role in drug efficacy and toxicity. In depth genetic research has provided evidence to predict the risk of developing certain toxicities for which personalized screening and surveillance protocols may be developed to prevent side effects. Here we describe the use of pharmacogenomics for optimal use of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy).	365	369	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	body

Genetic variation can impact on efficacy and risk of adverse events to commonly used oral agents in -diabetes. Metformin is not metabolized and its mechanism of action remains debated; however, several cation transporters have been identified. Variation in these pharmacokinetic genes might influence metformin response. Conversely, although the cytochrome P450 system has been implicated in sulfonylurea response in some small studies, to date variants affecting pharmacodynamics, including those in ABCC8 (SUR1) and TCF7L2, are the most promising. For thiazolidinedione response, variants in PPARG or ADIPOQ (adiponectin) have been variably associated with response. With increasing well-phenotyped cohorts and new methods, including genome-wide association studies, the next few years offer great hope to use pharmacogenetics to unravel drug and disease mechanisms, as well as the possibility to individualize therapy by genotype.	85	89	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
This case involved a 27-year-old man with extreme obesity (body mass index 45.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) who had a history of fulminant hepatitis and living-donor liver transplantation at 11 years of age. He had been receiving oral sustained-release tacrolimus (TAC) 1.5 mg daily, and the trough concentration in the blood was below 2.0 ng/mL. He has an intrinsic cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5)*3/*3 (G/G) genotype and graft liver with CYP3A5*3 allele donated by his biological father. Additionally, there were no data on the phenotype of P-glycoprotein. He did not take medications, grapefruit, or St. John's wort, which interact with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. He intentionally took 30 mg of TAC and presented with symptoms of general malaise and poisoning. On the day of hospitalization (day 0), TAC was discontinued due to an elevated blood TAC concentration of > 60 ng/mL. Additionally, the blood TAC concentration exceeded 10 ng/mL for more than 3 days. He exhibited mild elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine phosphokinase without apparent clinical symptoms. After discharge, blood TAC concentration decreased to 7.4 and 3.7 ng/mL on days 14 and 28, respectively, from the day of excessive TAC intake. Finally, the blood TAC concentration fell below 2.0 ng/mL on day 66. This case report showed that extreme obesity and the liver CYP3A5*3 allele delayed the elimination of TAC after excessive intake of the drug.	220	253	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral sustained-release tacrolimus
For patients requiring long-term anticoagulation, oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) such as warfarin have overwhelming efficacy data and present significant challenges. In addition to the potential exposure to numerous drug-drug and drug-food interactions, patients receiving warfarin require frequent monitoring. It had been hoped that the integration of pharmacogenomic with clinical information would improve anticoagulation control with warfarin, but trials have not supported this aim. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer both advantages and disadvantages and deserve consideration in appropriate patients.	497	516	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a nonsegmented positive sense RNA, enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the family of β-coronaviridae. This virus shall cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which consequently leads to breathing difficulty and need to admit to intensive care units (ICUs). The current conventional treatment combination in most of the hospitals in Iran includes azithromycin 500 + naproxen 500 + vitamin C 1,000 + Zinc + vitamin D3 1,000. In this case reports ( <i>n</i>  = 4), we would like to report significant findings in course of COVID-19 treatment reported to our clinic on August 8 and 9, 2020; patients presented as walk in and were advised house isolation and complete bed rest as there were no signs of lung involvement and their overall condition was stable. By the inclusion of cephalexin 500 in treatment combination, patients who received cephalexin 500 for 5 days along with other medicines did not develop any lung involvement and breathing complications. Cephalexin is the gold standard in upper and lower respiratory tract infections and here also shall play a vital role besides other conventional therapies. Azithromycin is a macrodial antibiotic working via the <i>ABCB1</i> gene pathway. As of date, there is no clear evidence of pharmacogenomics data in COVID-19 patients. More research needs to be performed in COVID-19 before any sort of pharmacogenomics tests could be advised.	1085	1090	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	tract
This study aimed to characterize the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of ethambutol in tuberculosis-HIV-coinfected adult patients. Ethambutol plasma concentrations, determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, in 63 patients receiving ethambutol as part of rifampin-based fixed-dose combination therapy for tuberculosis were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. A one-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination and four transit compartments prior to first-order absorption was found to adequately describe the concentration-time profiles of ethambutol in plasma. Body weight was implemented as an allometric function on the clearance and volume parameters. Estimates of oral clearance and volume of distribution were 77.4 liters/h and 76.2 liters, respectively. A G/A mutation with regard to CYP1A2 2159 G>A was associated with a 50% reduction in relative bioavailability. Simulations revealed that doses of 30 mg/kg of body weight and 50 mg/kg for G/G and G/A carriers, respectively, would result in clinically adequate exposure. The results presented here suggest that CYP1A2 polymorphism affects ethambutol exposure in this population and that current treatment guidelines may result in underexposure in patients coinfected with tuberculosis and HIV. Based on simulations, a dose increase from15 to 20 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg is suggested. However, the 50-mg/kg dose required to reach therapeutic exposure in G/A carriers may be inappropriate due to the dose-dependent toxicity of ethambutol. Additional studies are required to further investigate CYP450 polymorphism effects on ethambutol pharmacokinetics.	731	735	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral

Genetic defects in the pyrimidine nucleoside transporters of the CNT transporter family have not yet been reported. Metabolic investigations in a patient with infantile afebrile tonic-clonic seizures revealed increased urinary uridine and cytidine excretion. Segregation of this metabolic trait in the family showed the same biochemical phenotype in a healthy older brother of the index. Whole exome sequencing revealed biallelic mutations in SLC28A1 encoding the pyrimidine nucleoside transporter CNT1 in the index and his brother. Both parents and unaffected sibs showed the variant in heterozygous state. The transporter is expressed in the kidneys. Compelling evidence is available for the disrupting effect of the mutation on the transport function thus explaining the increased excretion of the pyrimidine nucleosides. The exome analysis also revealed a pathogenic mutation in PRRT2 in the index, explaining the epilepsy phenotype in infancy. At present, both the index (10 years) and his older brother are asymptomatic. Mutations in SLC28A1 cause a novel inborn error of metabolism that can be explained by the disrupted activity of the pyrimidine nucleoside transporter CNT1. This is the first report describing a defect in the family of CNT concentrative pyrimidine nucleoside transporter proteins encoded by the SLC28 gene family. In all likelihood, the epilepsy phenotype in the index is unrelated to the SLC28A1 defect, as this can be fully explained by the pathogenic PRRT2 variant. Clinical data on more patients are required to prove whether pathogenic mutations in SLC28A1 have any clinical consequences or are to be considered a benign metabolic phenotype.	219	234	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	urinary uridine
<b>Background:</b> Psoriasis is a chronic disorder with increasing new treatments targeting the T-helper cell (Th)-1/Th17 axis. There remains a subset of patients who experience a primary or secondary failure to biologic treatments.<b>Methods:</b> We present ten patients with psoriasis who failed biologic therapy with measurement of serum drug levels and anti-drug antibody levels (ADAs) with review of the current literature. Our objective was to identify demographic factors, disease status, drug level and ADAs which might correlate with primary and secondary failure.<b>Results:</b> There are a number of factors affecting drug levels in patients with psoriasis on biologics including the presence of ADAs, patient adherence to treatment regimes, pharmacogenetics and the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug following subcutaneous injection. Our results demonstrate that biologic failure is related to low serum drug levels subtherapeutic in 80% of our cohort. Primary failure may correlate with the presence of ADAs but not with serum drug levels. All patients were ANA negative and there remains considerable debate on the utility of routine ANA testing.<b>Conclusions:</b> The role of therapeutic drug monitoring in dermatology remains uncertain and requires further study. We aim to promote debate in the dermatology community as to the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring in routine practice.	827	839	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	subcutaneous
Despite the introduction of direct acting oral anticoagulants, warfarin remains the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant. However, warfarin therapy is plagued by the large inter- and intrapatient variability. The variability in dosing fueled research to identify clinical and genetic predictors and develop more accurate dosing algorithms. Observational studies have demonstrated the significant impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 on warfarin dose in patients of European ancestry and African-Americans. This evidence supported the design and conduct of clinical trials to assess whether genotype-guided dosing results in improved anticoagulation control and outcomes. The trial results have shown discordance by race, with pharmacogenetic algorithms improving dose and anticoagulation control among European ancestry patients compared with African-American patients. Herein, we review the evidence from observational and interventional studies, highlight the need for inclusion of minority race groups and propose the need to develop race specific dosing algorithms.	42	61	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants
Tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant used in solid organ transplantation, has a narrow therapeutic index and exhibits inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability. Achieving and maintaining a therapeutic level of the drug by giving appropriate doses is crucial for successful immunosuppression, especially during the initial post-transplant period. We studied the effect of <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>CYP3A4</i>, and <i>ABCB1</i> gene polymorphisms on tacrolimus trough concentrations in South Indian renal transplant recipients from Kerala to formulate a genotype-based dosing equation to calculate the required starting daily dose of tacrolimus to be given to each patient to attain optimal initial post-transplant period drug level. We also investigated the effect of these genes on drug-induced adverse effects and rejection episodes and looked into the global distribution of allele frequencies of these polymorphisms. One hundred forty-five renal transplant recipients on a triple immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid were included in this study. Clinical data including tacrolimus daily doses, trough levels (C<sub>0</sub>) and dose-adjusted tacrolimus trough concentration (C<sub>0</sub>/D) in blood at three time points (day 6, 6 months, and 1-year post-transplantation), adverse drug effects, rejection episodes, serum creatinine levels, etc., were recorded. The patients were genotyped for <i>CYP3A5</i>*3, <i>CYP3A4</i>*1B, <i>CYP3A4</i>*1G, <i>ABCB1</i> G2677T, and <i>ABCB1</i> C3435T polymorphisms by the PCR-RFLP method. We found that <i>CYP3A5</i>*3 polymorphism was the single most strongly associated factor determining the tacrolimus C<sub>0</sub>/D in blood at all three time points (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Using multiple linear regression, we formulated a simple and easy to compute equation that will help the clinician calculate the starting tacrolimus dose per kg body weight to be administered to a patient to attain optimal initial post-transplant period tacrolimus level. <i>CYP3A5</i> expressors had an increased chance of rejection than non-expressors (<i>p</i> = 0.028), while non-expressors had an increased risk for new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT) than expressors (<i>p</i> = 0.018). Genotype-guided initial tacrolimus dosing would help transplant recipients achieve optimal initial post-transplant period tacrolimus levels and thus prevent the adverse effects due to overdose and rejection due to inadequate dose. We observed inter-population differences in allele frequencies of drug metabolizer and transporter genes, emphasizing the importance of formulating population-specific dose prediction models to draw results of clinical relevance.	1911	1915	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	body
A wide inter-individual variability in the therapeutic response to cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDKis) has been reported. We herein present a case series of five patients treated with either palbociclib or ribociclib referred to our clinical pharmacological counselling, including therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), pharmacogenetics, and drug-drug interaction analysis to support clinicians in the management of CDKis treatment for metastatic breast cancer. Patients' plasma samples for TDM analysis were collected at steady state and analyzed by an LC-MS/MS method for minimum plasma concentration (C<sub>min</sub>) evaluation. Under and overexposure to the drug were defined based on the mean C<sub>min</sub> values observed in population pharmacokinetic studies. Polymorphisms in selected genes encoding for proteins involved in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination were analyzed (<i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>ABCB1, SLCO1B1</i>, and <i>ABCG2</i>). Three of the five reported cases presented a CDKi plasma level above the population mean value and were referred for toxicity. One of them presented a low function <i>ABCB1</i> haplotype (<i>ABCB1-rs1128503</i>, <i>rs1045642</i>, and <i>rs2032582</i>), possibly causative of both increased drug oral absorption and plasmatic concentration. Two patients showed underexposure to CDKis, and one of them was referred for early progression. In one patient, a <i>CYP3A5*1/*3</i> genotype was found to be potentially responsible for more efficient drug metabolism and lower drug plasma concentration. This intensified pharmacological approach in clinical practice has been shown to be potentially effective in supporting prescribing oncologists with dose and drug selection and could be ultimately useful for increasing both the safety and efficacy profiles of CDKi treatment.	1289	1293	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral
Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant. However, it remains a difficult drug to manage mostly because of its narrow therapeutic index and wide interpatient variability in anticoagulant effects. Over the past decade, there has been substantial progress in our understanding of genetic contributions to variable warfarin response, particularly with regard to warfarin dose requirements. The genes encoding for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) are the major genetic determinants of warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, respectively. Numerous studies have demonstrated significant contributions of these genes to warfarin dose requirements. The CYP2C9 gene has also been associated with bleeding risk with warfarin. The CYP4F2 gene influences vitamin K availability and makes minor contributions to warfarin dose requirements. Less is known about genes influencing warfarin response in African-American patients compared with other racial groups, but this is the focus of ongoing research. Several warfarin pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms and United States Food and Drug Administration-cleared genotyping tests are available for clinical use. Clinical trials are ongoing to determine the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of genotypeguided warfarin dosing. Results from these trials will likely influence clinical uptake and third party payer reimbursement for genotype-guided warfarin therapy. There is still a lack of pharmacogenetic data for the newly approved oral anticoagulants, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, and with other oral anticoagulants in the research and development pipeline. These data, once known, could be of great importance as routine monitoring parameters for these agents are not available.	1625	1644	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants
Polychemotherapeutic protocols for the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) always include thiopurines. Specific approaches vary in terms of drugs, dosages and combinations. Such therapeutic schemes, including risk-adapted intensity, have been extremely successful for children with ALL who have reached an outstanding 5-year survival of greater than 90% in developed countries. Innovative drugs such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the bi-specific T cell engager blinatumomab are available to further improve therapeutic outcomes. Nevertheless, daily oral thiopurines remain the backbone maintenance or continuation therapy. Pharmacogenetics allows the personalization of thiopurine therapy in pediatric ALL and clinical guidelines to tailor therapy on the basis of genetic variants in <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i> genes are already available. Other genes of interest, such as <i>ITPA</i> and <i>PACSIN2</i>, have been implicated in interindividual variability in thiopurines efficacy and adverse effects and need additional research to be implemented in clinical protocols. In this review we will discuss current literature and clinical guidelines available to implement pharmacogenetics for tailoring therapy with thiopurines in pediatric ALL.	584	600	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral thiopurines
The effective and toxic ranges of anticancer drugs are very narrow and, in some cases, inverted. Thus determination of the most appropriate dosage and schedule of administration is crucial for optimal chemotherapy. In common arm trials conducted in Japan and by Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) that used the same doses and schedules for the administration of carboplatin plus paclitaxel, the frequency of hematological toxicity was significantly higher in the Japanese trials than in the SWOG trial, despite demonstrating similar response rates. The frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in tumors was significantly higher among East Asian populations, and these populations are also reported to demonstrate a higher response rates to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). The prevalence of interstitial lung disease induced by treatment with EGFR-TKIs has been shown to be quite high in the Japanese population. Clinical trials of cetuximab against non-small cell lung cancer and of bevacizumab against stomach cancer have shown that these agents are only active in Caucasians. In a trial examining the use of sorafenib after transarterial chemoembolization in Korean and Japanese patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, the compliance and dose intensity of the drug were quite low compared with other trials. Although not only identified pharmacogenomics differences but also differences in social environment, and regional medical care, including pharmacoeconomics strongly influence ethnic differences in treatment response, further identification and understanding of the pharmacogenomics underlying ethnic differences will be essential to timely and reliable global development of new anticancer drugs.	1187	1200	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	transarterial
Tamoxifen is a major option for adjuvant endocrine treatment in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer patients. The conversion of the prodrug tamoxifen into the most active metabolite endoxifen is mainly catalyzed by the enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Genetic variation in the <i>CYP2D6</i> gene leads to altered enzyme activity, which influences endoxifen formation and thereby potentially therapy outcome. The association between genetically compromised CYP2D6 activity and low endoxifen plasma concentrations is generally accepted, and it was shown that tamoxifen dose increments in compromised patients resulted in higher endoxifen concentrations. However, the correlation between <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype and clinical outcome is still under debate. This has led to genotype-based tamoxifen dosing recommendations by the Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium (CPIC) in 2018, whereas in 2019, the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) discouraged the use of <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping in clinical practice for tamoxifen therapy. This paper describes the latest developments on <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping in relation to endoxifen plasma concentrations and tamoxifen-related clinical outcome. Therefore, we focused on Pharmacogenetic publications from 2018 (CPIC publication) to 2021 in order to shed a light on the current status of this debate.	494	510	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	endoxifen plasma

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the E23K variant of the potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11 (KCNJ11) gene on gliclazide modified release (MR) treatment in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 108 diabetic patients with no history of antidiabetic medication was treated with gliclazide MR for 16 weeks and underwent follow up at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16. All patients were genotyped for KCNJ11 E23K (rs5219). At baseline, patients with the KK genotype had higher blood glucose and lower serum insulin levels after oral glucose administration than patients with the EE and EK genotypes (P < 0.05 for all). During treatment, individuals with the KK genotype had lower fasting glucose levels and were more likely to attain the target fasting glucose level (Plog rank  = 0.028) than E allele carriers. Patients with the KK genotype had larger augmentations in changes (Δ) in acute insulin response (P = 0.049) and Δ body mass index (P = 0.003). Moreover, patients with the EK genotype had a lower variance in changes in fasting insulin levels (P = 0.049) and homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (P = 0.021) than those with the KK genotype. The findings of the present study suggest that the KCNJ11 E23K variant is associated with a greater effect of sulphonylurea treatment in newly diagnosed Chinese patients with T2DM.	606	618	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral glucose
Genetic polymorphism of genes involved in renal salt handling and arterial vessel tone is considered to be one of the causes of hypertension. Numerous reports suggest that cytochrome P4503A5 (CYP3A5) catalyzes 6β-hydroxylation of endogenous cortisol (CS), which is associated with sodium and water retention in the kidney and involved in the regulation of blood pressure. The purpose of the present study was to study the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYP3A5 gene with the urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol (6β-OH-CS/CS) ratio considered as quantitative phenotypes. CS measurements of three hundred (n=300) healthy, normotensive North Indian individuals was performed on morning spot urine samples by high-performance liquid chromatography. Furthermore, genotyping for CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A5*6 was performed by PCR-RFLP. The results indicated a unimodal distribution of CYP3A phenotypes in the North Indian population. In further analysis, all the phenotypes were distributed into three groups, demonstrating low (n=75), intermediate (n=150) and high CYP3A activity (n=75) based on CS and 6β-OH-CS levels and log 6β-OH-CS/CS ratios. The subjects in the low and high activity groups were genotyped for the CYP3A5*3 and *6 alleles. The present study demonstrated that the allele frequencies of CYP3A5*1 and *3 were 0.29 (95% CI, 0.22-0.36) and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.64-0.78), respectively. Notably, the frequency of normal homozygotes (CYP3A5*1/*1) was significantly higher in the high activity than the low activity group (11% vs. 5%). Similarly, the frequency of mutant homozygotes (CYP3A5*3/*3) was significantly higher in the low activity group than the high activity group (57% vs. 44%). The allele frequency of CYP3A5*3 was significantly higher in the low activity group (0.76) than the high activity group (0.67). The mean 6β-OH-CS/CS ratios were 110, 76 and 69 in wild-type homozygotes (n=12), heterozygotes (n=62) and mutant homozygotes (n=76), respectively. The difference between the normal and mutant homozygotes was statistically significant (P<0.05). The CYP3A5*6 allele was absent from all the subjects genotyped. This is the first study to report the genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5 in a North Indian population and its association with urinary 6β-OH-CS/CS ratio reflecting the CYP3A phenotypes.	498	533	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	urinary 6β-hydroxycortisol/cortisol
Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affects patient outcomes and satisfaction. New research has centered on evaluation of post-discharge and opioid-related nausea and vomiting. Mechanical and drug effects stimulate the release of central nervous system neurotransmitters acting at receptors in the vomiting center, area postrema, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Brain surgery has allowed insight into specific central emetogenic areas. Stimuli from peripheral organs act through afferent vagus neurons and a parasympathetic response causing nausea and vomiting. Opioids stimulate mu receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and cholinergic receptors in the vestibular system. Opioids also affect gastrointestinal (GI) tract mechanics by decreasing gastric emptying, intestinal motility, GI peristalsis, and secretions. Regional blocks and non-opioid multimodal analgesia help to decrease nausea and vomiting. Patient, surgery, and anesthesia factors contribute to risk and degree of PONV experienced. Pharmacogenetics plays a role in gene typing as antiemetic medication metabolism results in varying drug effectiveness. Risk scoring systems are available. Individualized multimodal plans can be designed as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol.	325	333	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	postrema

The calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus, cornerstone of most immunosuppressive regimens, is a drug with a narrow therapeutic window: underexposure can lead to allograft rejection and overexposure can result in an increased incidence of infections, toxicity and malignancies. Tacrolimus is metabolised in the liver and intestine by the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) isoforms CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. This review focusses on the clinical aspects of tacrolimus pharmacodynamics, such as efficacy and toxicity. Factors affecting tacrolimus pharmacokinetics, including pharmacogenetics and the rationale for routine CYP3A5*1/*3 genotyping in prospective paediatric renal transplant recipients, are also reviewed. Therapeutic drug monitoring, including pre-dose concentrations and pharmacokinetic profiles with the available "reference values", are discussed. Factors contributing to high intra-patient variability in tacrolimus exposure and its impact on clinical outcome are also reviewed. Lastly, suggestions for future research and clinical perspectives are discussed.	648	664	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	renal transplant
The advent of anti-TNF agents as the first approved targeted therapy in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients has made a major impact on our existing therapeutic algorithms. They have not only been approved for induction and maintenance treatment in IBD patients, but have also enabled us to define and achieve novel therapeutic outcomes, such as combination of clinical symptom control and endoscopic remission, as well as mucosal healing. Nevertheless, approximately one third of treated patients do not respond to initiated anti-TNF therapy and these treatments are associated with sometimes severe systemic side-effects. There is therefore the currently unmet clinical need do establish predictive markers of response to identify the subgroup of IBD patients, that have a heightened probability of response. There have so far been approaches from different fields of IBD research, to descry markers that would empower us to apply TNF-inhibitors in a more rational manner. These markers encompass findings from disease-related and clinical factors, pharmacokinetics, biochemical markers, blood and stool derived parameters, pharmacogenomics, microbial species, metabolic compounds, and mucosal factors. Furthermore, changes in the intestinal immune cell composition in response to therapeutic pressure of anti-TNF treatment have recently been implicated in the process of molecular resistance to these drugs. Insights into factors that determine resistance to anti-TNF therapy give reasonable hope, that a more targeted approach can then be utilized in these non-responders. Here, IL-23 could be identified as one of the key factors determining resistance to TNF-inhibitors. Growing insights into the molecular mechanism of action of TNF-inhibitors might also enable us to derive critical molecular markers that not only mediate the clinical effects of anti-TNF therapy, but which level of expression might also correlate with its therapeutic efficacy. In this narrative review, we present an overview of currently identified possible predictive markers for successful anti-TNF therapy and discuss identified molecular pathways that drive resistance to these substances. We will also point out the necessity and difficulty of developing and validating a diagnostic marker concerning clinically relevant outcome parameters, before they can finally enter daily clinical practice and enable a more personalized therapeutic approach.	445	452	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	mucosal

<i>Background and</i> <i>Objectives</i>: Codeine requires biotransformation by the <i>CYP2D6</i> enzyme, encoded by the polymorphic <i>CYP2D6</i> gene, to morphine for therapeutic efficacy. CYP2D6 phenotypes of poor, intermediate, and ultra-rapid metabolisers are at risk of codeine non-response and adverse drug reactions due to altered CYP2D6 function. The aim of this study was to determine whether genotype, inferred phenotype, and urinary and oral fluid codeine O-demethylation metabolites could predict codeine non-response following a short course of codeine. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: There were 131 Caucasians with persistent pain enrolled. Baseline assessments were recorded, prohibited medications ceased, and DNA sampling completed before commencing codeine 30 mg QDS for 5 days. Day 4 urine samples were collected 1-2 h post morning dose for codeine O-demethylation metabolites analysis. Final pain assessments were conducted on day 5. <i>Results</i>: None of the poor, intermediate, ultra-rapid metabolisers and only 24.5% of normal metabolisers responded to codeine. A simple scoring system to predict analgesic response from day 4 urinary metabolites was devised with overall prediction success of 79% (sensitivity 0.8, specificity 0.78) for morphine and 79% (sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.83) for morphine:creatinine ratio. <i>Conclusions</i>: In conclusion, this study provides tentative evidence that day 4 urinary codeine O-demethylation metabolites could predict non-response following a short course of codeine and could be utilised in the clinical assessment of codeine response at the point of care to improve analgesic efficacy and safety in codeine therapy. We offer a scoring system to predict codeine response from urinary morphine and urinary morphine:creatinine ratio collected on the morning of day 4 of codeine 30 mg QDS, but this requires validation before it could be considered for use to assess codeine response in clinical practice.	448	458	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral fluid
Warfarin remains the oral anticoagulant of choice in sub-Saharan Africa. However, dosing is challenging due to a highly variable clinical response for a given dose. This study aimed to develop and validate a clinical warfarin dose-initiation model in sub-Saharan Black-African patients. For the development cohort, we used data from 364 patients who were recruited from 8 outpatient clinics and hospital departments in Uganda and South Africa (June 2018-July 2019). Validation was undertaken using the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC) dataset (690 black patients). Four predictors (age, weight, target International Normalized Ratio range, and HIV status) were included in the final model, which achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs; mean of absolute differences between true dose and dose predicted by the model) of 11.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10.4-12.8) and 12.5 (95% CI 11.6-13.4) mg/week in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. Two other clinical models, IWPC and Gage, respectively, obtained MAEs of 12.5 (95% CI 11.3-13.7) and 12.7 (95% CI 11.5-13.8) mg/week in the development cohort, and 12.1 (95% CI 11.2-13.0) and 12.2 (95% CI 11.4-13.1) mg/week in the validation cohort. Compared with fixed dose-initiation, our model decreased the percentage of patients at high risk of suboptimal anticoagulation by 7.5% (1.5-13.7%) and 11.9% (7.1-16.8%) in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The clinical utility of this model will be tested in a prospective study. Study Highlights WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? ☑ Warfarin dosing remains challenging due to a highly variable clinical response for a given dose. WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? ☑ Can a clinical dose-initiation model be developed and validated for sub-Saharan Black-African patients? WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? ☑ We have developed the first warfarin dose-initiation clinical model for Black-African patients in Uganda and South Africa. HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE? ☑ We will be implementing and validating this model in a prospective cohort to inform future large-scale implementation. More optimized dosing should improve the quality of warfarin anticoagulation in these two developing countries.	21	39	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral anticoagulant
Early prediction of clearance mechanisms allows for the rapid progression of drug discovery and development programs, and facilitates risk assessment of the pharmacokinetic variability associated with drug interactions and pharmacogenomics. Here we propose a scientific framework--Extended Clearance Classification System (ECCS)--which can be used to predict the predominant clearance mechanism (rate-determining process) based on physicochemical properties and passive membrane permeability. Compounds are classified as: Class 1A--metabolism as primary systemic clearance mechanism (high permeability acids/zwitterions with molecular weight (MW) ≤400 Da), Class 1B--transporter-mediated hepatic uptake as primary systemic clearance mechanism (high permeability acids/zwitterions with MW >400 Da), Class 2--metabolism as primary clearance mechanism (high permeability bases/neutrals), Class 3A--renal clearance (low permeability acids/zwitterions with MW ≤400 Da), Class 3B--transporter mediated hepatic uptake or renal clearance (low permeability acids/zwitterions with MW >400 Da), and Class 4--renal clearance (low permeability bases/neutrals). The performance of the ECCS framework was validated using 307 compounds with single clearance mechanism contributing to ≥70% of systemic clearance. The apparent permeability across clonal cell line of Madin - Darby canine kidney cells, selected for low endogenous efflux transporter expression, with a cut-off of 5 × 10(-6) cm/s was used for permeability classification, and the ionization (at pH7) was assigned based on calculated pKa. The proposed scheme correctly predicted the rate-determining clearance mechanism to be either metabolism, hepatic uptake or renal for ~92% of total compounds. We discuss the general characteristics of each ECCS class, as well as compare and contrast the framework with the biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) and the biopharmaceutics drug disposition classification system (BDDCS). Collectively, the ECCS framework is valuable in early prediction of clearance mechanism and can aid in choosing the right preclinical tool kit and strategy for optimizing drug exposure and evaluating clinical risk of pharmacokinetic variability caused by drug interactions and pharmacogenomics.	996	1003	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	hepatic

Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis (CRSwNP) affects the quality of life of patients suffering from it. The search for a suitable biomarker has been conducted over the last decades. Interleukin 5 receptor subunit alpha (IL-5Rα) involves the activation, maintenance, and survival of eosinophils, which are highly tied to chronic inflammatory processes of the airways, like asthma or CRSwNP. In this study, we evaluate the utility of <i>IL5RA</i> as a genetic biomarker in CRSwNP. <i>IL5RA</i> mRNA expression level was analyzed in different groups of patients by performing qPCR assays. A significant increase in <i>IL5RA</i> expression was observed in CRSwNP patients, especially those with asthma and atopy. We found differences in expression levels when comparing groups with or without polyposis or asthma, as well as some atypical cases related to eosinophil levels. That opens a path to future studies to further characterize groups of patients with common features in the context of pharmacogenetics and in an era towards developing a more precise personalized treatment with IL-5Rα as a therapeutic target for CRSwNP.	390	396	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	CRSwNP

A significant increase in <i>IL5RA</i> expression was observed in CRSwNP patients, especially those with asthma and atopy. We found differences in expression levels when comparing groups with or without polyposis or asthma, as well as some atypical cases related to eosinophil levels. That opens a path to future studies to further characterize groups of patients with common features in the context of pharmacogenetics and in an era towards developing a more precise personalized treatment with IL-5Rα as a therapeutic target for CRSwNP.	1125	1131	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	CRSwNP
The antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel is bioactivated by the polymorphic enzyme CYP2C19. Prospective clinical studies demonstrated an association between CYP2C19 loss of function (LoF) variants and an increased risk of thrombotic events under clopidogrel, but pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing is not frequently implemented in clinical practice. We report our experience with PGx-guided clopidogrel therapy with particular regard to clinically relevant patient management changes.	218	228	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	thrombotic

Nimodipine, an L-type cerebroselective calcium channel antagonist, is the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the neuroprotection of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Four randomized, placebo-controlled trials of nimodipine demonstrated clinical improvement over placebo; however, these occurred before precision medicine with pharmacogenomics was readily available. The standard enteral dose of nimodipine recommended after aSAH is 60 mg every 4 h. However, up to 78% of patients with aSAH develop systemic arterial hypotension after taking the drug at the recommended dose, which could theoretically limit its neuroprotective role and worsen cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow, particularly when concomitant vasospasm is present. We investigated the association between nimodipine dose changes and clinical outcomes in a consecutive series of 150 patients (mean age, 56 years; 70.7% women) with acute aSAH. We describe the pharmacogenomic relationship of nimodipine dose reduction with clinical outcomes. These results have major implications for future individualized dosing of nimodipine in the era of precision medicine.	173	196	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	aneurysmal subarachnoid

<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To examine whether serotonin (5-HT) related genetic variants moderate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) at the radius, lumbar spine (LS) BMD, total body less head (TBLH) bone mineral content (BMC) and markers of bone metabolism (osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX-1], and bone specific alkaline phosphatase to CTX-1 ratio) were examined in an observational study, enrolling 15- to 20-year-old participants, unmedicated or within a month of SSRI initiation. Variants in <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295), <i>HTR1B</i> (rs6296), <i>HTR1D</i> (rs6300), <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311 and rs6314), <i>HTR2B</i> (rs6736017), and the serotonin transporter intron 2 variable number tandem repeat (STin2 VNTR) were genotyped. Linear mixed-effects regression analysis examined associations between SSRI use, genetic variants, and skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> After adjusting for relevant covariates, rs6295 CC and GC genotypes in 262 participants (60% female, mean ± SD age = 18.9 ± 1.6 years) were significantly associated with higher LS BMD compared to the GG genotype. Rs6311 GG SSRI users had greater LS BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.18, <i>p</i> = <0.0001). Female SSRI users with the combination of rs6295 CC+GC and rs6311 GG genotypes had greater LS BMD than female SSRI nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.29, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). SSRI users with the rs6295 GG genotype had higher trabecular BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 3.60, <i>p</i> = 0.05). No significant interactions were found for TBLH BMC or bone turnover markers. After correcting for multiple comparisons, none of the results retained significance. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> In older adolescents and young adults, <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295) and <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311) variants may moderate the effect of SSRIs on BMD. Sex differences may exist and require further examination. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm our preliminary findings. <b><i>Clinical Trial Registration:</i></b> clinicaltrials.gov NCT02147184.	1249	1251	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	LS
<b>Background:</b> Globally, the use of amphetamines as therapeutic agents in pediatric medicine is a crucial area of concern, especially given the population's vulnerability. <b>Methods:</b> On 6 August 2023, a search was conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov using "amphetamine" as the keyword. Two independent examiners screened trials against set criteria, including a focus on amphetamine, completion status, an interventional approach, and included children. Ongoing or observational studies were excluded. Data extracted from the qualified trials encompassed primary objectives, participant counts, study duration, and outcomes, with the aim of analyzing children disorders treated by amphetamine. <b>Results:</b> On 6 August 2023, a search of the ClinicalTrials.gov database with the term "amphetamines" identified 179 clinical trials. After extensive exclusion criteria, 19 trials were ultimately selected for analysis. The predominant condition under investigation was attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), present in 84.2% of studies. Key study characteristics included: phase 4 trials (36.8%), randomized allocation (63.2%), and the parallel intervention model (42.1%). Masking techniques varied, with no masking in 42.1% of studies, and double and quadruple masking both accounting for 21.1%. Geographically, 78.9% of the studies' participants were from the United States. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study highlights the notable therapeutic potential of amphetamines in pediatric ADHD populations and emphasizes the importance of recognizing potential side effects and addiction risks. As pharmacogenomics offers the prospect of personalized treatments, there is potential to increase therapeutic efficacy and decrease adverse reactions. It is vital to balance these benefits against the inherent risks, understanding the need for continued research to optimize the use of amphetamines in medicine.	1495	1499	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	ADHD
The kidney has attracted the attention of diabetologists as an organ involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis not only by gluconeogenesis, but also by renal glucose excretion. Sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs), particularly SGLT2, are responsible for reabsorption of up to 99% of the filtered glucose. SGLT2 is coded by the SLC5A2 gene, which maps on chromosome 16. Pharmacological reduction of tubular glucose reabsorption results in improved glycemic control in Type 2 diabetic patients. Since the SGLTs reabsorb most of the filtered glucose (90%), it is not surprising that mutations in SLC5A2 cause familial renal glucosuria. A recent study pointed out a possible role of common genetic variation in SLC5A2 in the control of glucose homeostasis. SLC5A2 polymorphisms might therefore represent potential candidates for pharmacogenomic studies targeting the impact of these variants on the efficacy of antidiabetic treatment that is based on inhibition of SGLT2 activity.	625	630	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	renal
Alopecia areata, alopecia totalis, and alopecia universalis likely represent a constellation of related diseases with similar, yet distinct heritability markers. There is currently no known curative therapy that works universally for all patients. Pharmacogenomic research enables the pharmaceutical industry to understand variability of patient responses to drugs during clinical drug development and during post-marketing surveillance. Understanding the genetic basis for patient response/non-response can enable the development of individualized therapies for those patients with an inherited basis for altered response to drug therapy. There are multiple examples of drugs that now contain a recommendation for genetic testing before dosing in their drug labels, directing clinicians to obtain genetic information for each individual patient in order to help direct drug therapy.	0	15	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Alopecia areata

Paritaprevir (PTV) is a non-structural protein 3/4A protease inhibitor developed for the treatment of hepatitis C disease as a fixed dose combination of ombitasvir (OBV) and ritonavir (RTV) with or without dasabuvir. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 on in vitro PTV metabolism using human recombinant CYP3A4, CYP3A5 (rCYP3A4, rCYP3A5) and human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped as either CYP3A5*1/*1, CYP3A5*1/*3 or CYP3A5*3/*3. The intrinsic clearance (CL<sub>int</sub>, V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) for the production of a metabolite from PTV in rCYP3A4 was 1.5 times higher than that in rCYP3A5. The PTV metabolism in CYP3A5*1/*1 and CYP3A5*1/*3 HLMs expressing CYP3A5 was comparable to that in CYP3A5*3/*3 HLMs, which lack CYP3A5. CYP3A4 expression level was significantly correlated with PTV disappearance rate and metabolite formation. In contrast, there was no such correlation found for CYP3A5 expression level. This study represents that the major CYP isoform involved in PTV metabolism is CYP3A4, with CYP3A5 having a minor role in PTV metabolism. The findings of the present study may provide foundational information on PTV metabolism, and may further support dosing practices in HCV-infected patients prescribed PTV-based therapy.	501	503	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	CL

Rilpivirine (RPV), the latest nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor active against HIV-1, is prescribed in a standard dosage of 25 mg once a day in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The aim of this observational study was to characterize the RPV pharmacokinetic profile, to quantify interpatient variability, and to identify potential factors that could influence drug exposure. RPV concentration data were collected from HIV-infected patients as part of routine therapeutic drug monitoring performed in our center (Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology). A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with NONMEM by comparing various structural models. The influence of demographic and clinical covariates, as well as frequent genetic polymorphisms in 5 genes (CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*17, UGT1A1*28, and UGT1A4*2), on RPV elimination was explored. A total of 325 plasma concentration measurements were obtained from 249 HIV-positive patients. Plasma concentrations ranged from 12 to 255 ng/ml. A one-compartment model with zero-order absorption best characterized RPV pharmacokinetics. The average RPV clearance (CL) was 11.7 liters/h, the average volume of distribution was 401 liters, and the mean absorption time was 4 h. The interinterindividual variability (IIV) for CL was estimated to be 33%. None of the available demographic or genetic covariates showed any influence on RPV pharmacokinetics, but 29% of the patients were predicted to present minimal concentrations below the recently identified target cutoff value of 50 ng/ml. The variability in RPV pharmacokinetics appears to be lower than that for most other antiretroviral drugs. However, under the standard regimen of 25 mg daily, a significant number of patients might be underdosed. It remains to be investigated whether the underexposure has an impact on the development of resistance while patients are on maintenance therapy.	1812	1822	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	underdosed
Oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) based on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; coumarin derivatives) is the current mainstay for the prevention and long-term treatment of a variety of thromboembolic disorders. Care of patients on OAT is challenging due to considerable variability in the response to a particular dose. This has been attributed to environmental, demographic, clinical and genetic variables. Individualized responses represent a major clinical challenge because patients may experience adverse health outcomes from bleeding or thrombosis as a result of over- or under-coagulation, respectively. Growing evidence indicates that up to 60% of the individual pharmacological response to coumarins might be due to genetic variables and affected by polymorphisms in the genes encoding two enzymes, namely, vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) and cytochrome P450 CYP2C9. Genetic testing has been proposed as a useful tool for allowing prediction of the dose response during initial anticoagulation therapy, to assess variability in dose maintenance and to identify warfarin 'resistance'. However, genetic testing is not a panacea. Limitations include the optimal composition of test panels, still largely unknown, information concerning inter-individual variability, lack of analytical and quality specifications, lack of comprehensive outcome analyses to enable assessment of cost-effectiveness, lack of universal agreement related to reliable dosing algorithms and other ethical and social issues. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of the pharmacogenetics of VKAs, as well as assessing potential advantages and limitations. Although it might be premature to recommend routine genetic testing, the future development and clinical validation of simple but comprehensive algorithms integrating the most informative gene polymorphisms (VKORC1 and CYP2C9) with some demographic information (age, race, body mass index) and clinical variables (comorbidities, drugs interference), and standardized dietary intake of vitamin K may provide a valuable tool in the care of patients on OAT with conventional VKAs. However, the ongoing development of new anticoagulant drugs targeting thrombin and factor X will introduce a paradigm shift in long-term anticoagulation therapy, so that consideration could be given to demise pharmacogenetics testing for VKAs.	0	18	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Oral anticoagulant
Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are commonly used to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Endorsed by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and the European Society of Cardiology, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have displaced warfarin as the OAC of choice for both conditions, due to improved safety profiles, fewer drug-drug and drug-diet interactions, and lack of monitoring requirements. Despite their widespread use and improved safety over warfarin, DOAC-related bleeding remains a major concern for patients. DOACs have stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; however, variability in DOAC response is common and may be attributed to numerous factors, including patient-specific factors, concomitant medications, comorbid conditions, and genetics. Although DOAC randomized controlled trials included patients of varying ages and levels of kidney function, they failed to include patients of diverse ancestries. Additionally, current evidence to support DOAC pharmacogenetic associations have primarily been derived from European and Asian individuals. Given differences in genotype frequencies and disease burden among patients of different biogeographic groups, future research must engage diverse populations to assess and quantify the impact of predictors on DOAC response. Current under-representation of patients from diverse racial groups does not allow for proper generalization of the influence of clinical and genetic factors in relation to DOAC variability. Herein, we discuss factors affecting DOAC response, such as age, sex, weight, kidney function, drug interactions, and pharmacogenetics, while offering a new perspective on the need for further research including frequently excluded groups.	0	19	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Oral anticoagulants

Behçet disease (BD) is an enigmatic inflammatory disorder with multisystemic complications which is endemic in some countries but can be seen in the entire world. Valid diagnostic criteria are available. The pathology is related to a specific perivasculitis with involvement of both arteries and veins of all sizes. Minor arterial and cardiac involvement is frequent in BD but is usually asymptomatic. In exceptional cases cardiac symptoms may be the 1st manifestation of BD. The prevalence of severe cardiac complications (cardio-Behçet) should be < 10%. An impressive therapeutic improvement has been achieved by using appropriate catheterization techniques, coronary and intra-arterial stents, colchicine, drug-response modifying drugs and immunotherapy but, still cardio-Behçet has a poor prognosis. Efforts are undertaken to improve morbidity and prognosis with the use of newer drugs. An important part of the complications in BD are related to the frequent thromboembolic complications and there is high possibility that newer oral anticoagulants will be superior to the classical anticoagulants presently used. Available biologic agents have already been frequently used and seem to have improved the prognosis, but efforts are undertaken to find newer biologic agents with better therapeutic performance and less side-effects. Summarizing as much as possible the effects of the presently used biotherapy in BD, interferon-alpha is effective against many ocular, genital and perhaps vascular manifestations, but its effectiveness is limited by frequent adverse-effects (even if not dangerous for the cardiovascular system). Infliximab is a valid option in the therapy of ocular and cutaneous manifestations but it is less convincing in the therapy of vascular manifestations in vascular- and neuro-Behçet; furthermore, side-effects, including severe cardiovascular complications, are seen in a minority of patients; perhaps worse, infliximab seems to loose efficacy in the long-term therapy, while pharmacogenetics and receptor polymorphism may explain the existence of non-responders and the occurrence of resistance. Adalimumab might be a promising alternative for infliximab and seems to exert a good effect in an eurysmatic and other vascular complications. However, we lack long-term studies. Other biologic agents have been used only in few cases and it is too early to say if they offer new therapeutic perspectives.	1471	1478	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	genital
Kidney transplantation requires lifelong immunosuppression with agents that prevent allograft rejection. Immunosuppressive regimens typically include a steroid, an immune modulator (eg, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or mycophenolate sodium), and a calcineurin inhibitor, either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Tacrolimus is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 in both the liver and small intestine. Drugs that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4, as well as inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4, can cause significant interactions with tacrolimus. A review of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus is important to enhance practitioners' understanding when using tacrolimus after kidney transplantation. It is also important to educate patients and their families about tacrolimus. Patients' adherence to this medication regimen is pivotal for allograft survival. A consistent and comprehensive approach to education and discharge teaching is a key component of adherence and the attainment of therapeutic drug levels. At Shands Jacksonville Transplant Center, discharge education and teaching tools aid the transplant professionals and facilitate patients' adherence. This in turn supports the goals of maintaining therapeutic serum levels of tacrolimus and improving renal allograft survival.	84	93	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	allograft

This study aimed to analyze associations between genetic variants and the occurrence of clinical outcomes in dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban users. This was a retrospective real-world study linking genotype data of three Finnish biobanks with national register data on drug dispensations and healthcare encounters. We investigated several single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the ABCG2, ABCB1, CES1, and CYP3A5 genes potentially associated with bleeding or thromboembolic events in direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) users based on earlier research. We used Cox regression models to compare the incidence of clinical outcomes between carriers and noncarriers of the SNVs or haplotypes.

Apixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant, a factor Xa inhibitor, used for the prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Despite using recommended dosing a few patients might still experience bleeding or lack of efficacy that might be related to inappropriate drug exposure. We conducted a genome-wide association study using data from 1,325 participants in the pivotal phase three trial of apixaban with the aim to identify genetic factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. A candidate gene analysis was also performed for pre-specified variants in <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>ABCG2</i>, <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>, and <i>SULT1A1</i>, with a subsequent analysis of all available polymorphisms within the candidate genes. Significant findings were further evaluated to assess a potential association with clinical outcome such as bleeding or thromboembolic events. No variant was consistently associated with an altered apixaban exposure on a genome-wide level. The candidate gene analyses showed a statistically significant association with a well-known variant in the drug transporter gene <i>ABCG2</i> (c.421G > T, rs2231142). Patients carrying this variant had a higher exposure to apixaban [area under the curve (AUC), beta = 151 (95% CI 59-243), <i>p</i> = 0.001]. On average, heterozygotes displayed a 5% increase of AUC and homozygotes a 17% increase of AUC, compared with homozygotes for the wild-type allele. Bleeding or thromboembolic events were not significantly associated with <i>ABCG2</i> rs2231142. This large genome-wide study demonstrates that genetic variation in the drug transporter gene <i>ABCG2</i> is associated with the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. However, the influence of this finding on drug exposure was small, and further studies are needed to better understand whether it is of relevance for ischemic and bleeding events.	21	39	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral anticoagulant

Treatments for patients with CF have primarily focused on the downstream end-organ consequences of defective CFTR. Since the discovery of the CFTR gene that causes CF in 1989 there have been tremendous advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of CF. This has recently led to the development of new CFTR mutation-specific targeted therapies for select patients with CF. This review will discuss the characteristics of the CFTR gene, the CFTR mutations that cause CF and the new mutation specific pharmacological treatments including gene therapy that are contributing to the dawning of a new era in cystic fibrosis care.	0	6	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Cystic

Warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant, but large interindividual variations exist in the dose required to achieve comparable therapeutic effects. Several clinical and genetic variables have been identified that influence warfarin dosing. However, interactions between genotype and nutrition remain uncertain in terms of dietary vitamin K intake. To investigate genotype-nutrient interactions in warfarin anticoagulation therapy, 202 consecutive outpatients (M/F = 142/60, mean age, 69 years) undergoing treatment with warfarin were enrolled. Prevalent single nucleotide polymorphisms in VKORC1 and CYP2C9 were genotyped, and dietary vitamin K intake during the week preceding the blood sampling was quantitatively estimated by a dietitian-assisted questionnaire. Patients were classified according to low, medium, or high vitamin K intake. The mean daily warfarin dose in subjects with a VKORC1-1639 A/A genotype was significantly smaller than that with a -1639A/G genotype (2.74 vs. 3.91 mg/day, respectively, p < 0.0001). Dose requirements did not differ between subjects with a CYP2C9 *1/*3 genotype versus a CYP2C9 *1/*1 genotype. In subjects with a variant VKORC1-1639 G allele, the mean daily warfarin dose was significantly attenuated by low vitamin K intake compared with medium and high intake after adjustment for covariates (3.4 vs. 5.0 vs. 4.0 mg/day, respectively, p = 0.028). No such genotype effects were observed in homozygous patients for the VKORC1-1639 A allele. The results of the present study suggest that the capacity of dietary vitamin K intake to influence warfarin dose requirements during anticoagulation therapy is VKORC1 genotype-dependent, at least in part.	39	57	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral anticoagulant
Variations in disease onset and/or severity have often been observed in siblings with cystic fibrosis (CF), despite the same <i>CFTR</i> genotype and environment. We postulated that genomic variation (modifier and/or pharmacogenomic variants) might explain these clinical discordances. From a cohort of patients included in the Wisconsin randomized clinical trial (RCT) of newborn screening (NBS) for CF, we identified two brothers who showed discordant lung disease courses as children, with one milder and the other more severe than average, and a third, eldest brother, who also has severe lung disease. Leukocytes were harvested as the source of DNA, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed. Variants were identified and analyzed using in-house-developed informatics tools. Lung disease onset and severity were quantitatively different between brothers during childhood. The youngest, less severely affected brother is homozygous for <i>HFE</i> p.H63D. He also has a very rare <i>PLG</i> p.D238N variant that may influence host-pathogen interaction during chronic lung infection. Other variants of interest were found differentially between the siblings. Pharmacogenomics findings were consistent with the middle, most severely affected brother having poor outcomes to common CF treatments. We conclude that genomic variation between siblings with CF is expected. Variable lung disease severity may be associated with differences acting as genetic modifiers and/or pharmacogenomic factors, but large cohort studies are needed to assess this hypothesis.	86	92	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	cystic
One strategy for understanding variability in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication response, and therefore redressing the current trial-and-error approach to ADHD medication management, is to identify genetic moderators of treatment. This article summarizes ADHD pharmacogenetic investigative efforts to date, which have primarily focused on short-term response to methylphenidate and largely been limited by modest sample sizes. The most well studied genes include the dopamine transporter and dopamine D(4) receptor, with additional genes that have been significantly associated with stimulant medication response including the adrenergic alpha(2A)-receptor, catechol-O-methyltransferase, D(5) receptor, noradrenaline (norepinephrine) transporter protein 1 and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa. Unfortunately, results of current ADHD pharmacogenetic studies have not been entirely consistent, possibly due to differences in study design, medication dosing regimens and outcome measures. Future directions for ADHD pharmacogenetics investigations may include examination of drug-metabolizing enzymes and a wider range of stimulant and non-stimulant medications. In addition, researchers are increasingly interested in going beyond the individual candidate gene approach to investigate gene-gene interactions or pathways, effect modification by additional environmental exposures and whole genome approaches. Advancements in ADHD pharmacogenetics will be facilitated by multi-site collaborations to obtain larger sample sizes using standardized protocols. Although ADHD pharmacogenetic efforts are still in a relatively early stage, their potential clinical applications may include the development of treatment efficacy and adverse effect prediction algorithms that incorporate the interplay of genetic and environmental factors, as well as the development of novel ADHD treatments.	1895	1899	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	ADHD
Pharmacotherapy for pain currently involves trial and error. A previous study on inherited erythromelalgia (a genetic model of neuropathic pain due to mutations in the sodium channel, Na<sub>v</sub> 1.7) used genomics, structural modelling and biophysical and pharmacological analyses to guide pharmacotherapy and showed that carbamazepine normalizes voltage dependence of activation of the Na<sub>v</sub> 1.7-S241T mutant channel, reducing pain in patients carrying this mutation. However, whether this approach is applicable to other Na<sub>v</sub> channel mutants is still unknown.	91	106	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	erythromelalgia
The rising prevalence of primary pediatric hypertension and its tracking into adult hypertension point to the importance of determining its pathogenesis to gain insights into its current and emerging management. Considering that the intricate control of BP is governed by a myriad of anatomical, molecular biological, biochemical, and physiological systems, multiple genes are likely to influence an individual's BP and susceptibility to develop hypertension. The long-term regulation of BP rests on renal and non-renal mechanisms. One renal mechanism relates to sodium transport. The impaired renal sodium handling in primary hypertension and salt sensitivity may be caused by aberrant counter-regulatory natriuretic and anti-natriuretic pathways. The sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems are examples of antinatriuretic pathways. An important counter-regulatory natriuretic pathway is afforded by the renal autocrine/paracrine dopamine system, aberrations of which are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension, including that associated with obesity. We present updates on the complex interactions of these two systems with dietary salt intake in relation to obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress. We review how insults during pregnancy such as maternal and paternal malnutrition, glucocorticoid exposure, infection, placental insufficiency, and treatments during the neonatal period have long-lasting effects in the regulation of renal function and BP. Moreover, these effects have sex differences. There is a need for early diagnosis, frequent monitoring, and timely management due to increasing evidence of premature target organ damage. Large controlled studies are needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of the treatment of elevated BP during childhood, especially to establish the validity of the current definition and treatment of pediatric hypertension.	594	606	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	renal sodium

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its complications such as diabetic macular edema continue to remain a major cause for legal blindness in the developed world. While the introduction of anti-tVEGF agents has significantly improved visual outcomes of patients with DR, unpredictable response, largely due to genetic polymorphisms, appears to be a challenge with this therapy. With advances in identification of various genetic biomarkers, novel therapeutic strategies consisting of gene transfer are being developed and tested for patients with DR. Application of pharmacogenetic principles appears to be a promising futuristic strategy to attenuate diabetes-mediated retinal vasculopathy. In this comprehensive review, data from recent studies in the field of pharmacogenomics for the treatment of DR have been provided.	73	78	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	edema
P-glycoprotein encoded by the ABCB1 gene constitutes a molecular barrier in the small and large bowel epithelium, and its different expression may influence susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to assess the contribution of the C3435T polymorphism to disease risk in the Polish population. A total of 100 patients (50 Crohn's disease (CD), 50 ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 100 healthy controls were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C3435T by using the PCR-RFLP method. Patients were classified on the basis of disease phenotype and the specific treatment used. A meta-analysis was carried out of our results and those from previously published Polish studies. There was no significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies in IBD patients compared with controls. For CD patients, a lower frequency of TT genotype in those with colonic disease, a lower frequency of T allele, and a higher frequency of C allele in those with luminal disease were observed, whereas for UC patients, a lower frequency of CT genotype was observed in those with left-sided colitis. A meta-analysis showed a tendency towards higher prevalence of CC genotype in UC cases. These results indicate that the C3435T variants may confer a risk for UC and influence disease behaviour.	342	347	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Crohn

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder among children and adolescents with high heritability. Molecular genetic findings support the thesis that dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmission pathways account for the etiology of this complex disease. Genetic research comprises formal genetic studies, candidate gene studies, linkage analyses, and recently large-scale genome wide association studies, gene-environement interaction studies, and pharmacogenetics. This article comprehensively reviews the latest findings on the genetics of ADHD.	598	602	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	ADHD
EVALUATION OF: Liggett SB, Cresci S, Kelly RJ et al.: A GRK5 polymorphism that inhibits beta-adrenergic receptor signaling is protective in heart failure. Nat. Med. 14, 510-517 (2008). beta-Adrenoceptor blockade therapy was developed for the treatment of hypertension but is now also a cornerstone in the treatment of heart failure. Based on the mechanisms of action and current knowledge of pathway signaling, Ligget et al. hypothesized that genetic variants within G-protein coupled receptor kinases might alter disease course and response to beta-adrenoceptor blockade therapy. Following a multistep approach, a common variant in GRK5 was identified as being important in vitro and in vivo (mouse model) in beta-adrenergic desensitization, and was epidemiologically related to survival and therapy response in African-Americans. Although such a variety of research approaches is appealing, owing to the large number of used methods readers remain puzzled on some issues because it is not possible to give all details of each individual study. Therefore, interpretation of the overwhelming amount of results is difficult. In an era of shifting emphasis from classic hypothesis driven pharmacogenetics to genome-wide association studies, this study shows that hypothesis driven translational research is still of high value, especially in phenotypes as investigated here.	813	830	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	African-Americans
<b>Objectives:</b> Dopamine plays an important role in modulating attention and motor behaviours, dimensions altered in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Numerous association studies have linked dopamine receptor 4 (<i>DRD4</i>) to increased risk of ADHD. This study investigated the effect of <i>DRD4</i> exon 3 polymorphism on child behaviours in response to treatment with methylphenidate. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 374 children diagnosed with ADHD (ages 6-12 years) were evaluated under three experimental conditions: baseline, placebo and MPH (0.5 mg/kg/day). This was a 2-week prospective within-subject, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The Conners' Global Index for parents and for teachers was used to evaluate the behaviours of the children. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test the effect of the interaction between <i>DRD4</i> genotype and experimental conditions. <b>Results:</b> A significant interaction between <i>DRD4</i> genotype and treatment was detected when the child's behaviour was evaluated by the parents (<i>P</i> = 0.035, effect size of 0.014), driven by a better treatment response in children homozygous for long 7-repeat allele. <b>Conclusions:</b> According to the parent assessment, children homozygous for the long 7-repeat allele were more responsive to experimental condition. This is the largest pharmacogenetic investigation of the effect of <i>DRD4</i> exon 3 polymorphism in childhood ADHD. <b>Trial Registration:</b> clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT00483106.	265	269	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	ADHD
The objective of this prospective study was to examine the exposure to the main active metabolites of ciprofloxacin in critically ill patients and to examine the factors (demographic, laboratory and genetic) that could potentially affect the drug metabolic conversion of ciprofloxacin. The secondary aim was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for the metabolite showing the most associations with the abovementioned factors. A total of 29 patients were treated with intravenous infusion of ciprofloxacin and enrolled on this trial. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken at 1, 4, and 11.5 h following the completion of the infusion. Sex, age, body weight, height, serum creatinine and bilirubin levels, and creatinine clearance (CL<sub>CR</sub>) were recorded, and polymorphisms rs2032582 and rs1045642 in the <i>ABCB1</i> gene, rs4148977 in the <i>SLCO1A2</i> gene and rs762551 in the <i>CYP1A2</i> gene were analyzed. A three-stage parent drug-metabolite population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Median (IQR) metabolite/parent ratios of the desethylene ciprofloxacin, formyl ciprofloxacin and oxociprofloxacin were 5.86 (4.09-9.87)%, 4.08 (3.38-6.92)% and 5.91 (3.42-13.65)%, respectively. The desethylene ciprofloxacin metabolic ratio was positively associated with height (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2277, <i>p</i> = 0.0089) and CL<sub>CR</sub> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2023, <i>p</i> = 0.0144) and negatively associated with age (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2227, <i>p</i> = 0.0112). Males had a significantly higher oxociprofloxacin metabolic ratio than females (9.14 vs 3.42%, <i>p</i> = 0.0043). In the desethylene ciprofloxacin population PK model, the volume of distribution decreased with age, the parent drug-metabolite transfer rate constant increased with CL<sub>CR</sub>, and the metabolite elimination rate constant decreased with age and is increased in <i>CYP1A2</i> rs762551 variant allele carriers. We therefore hypothesized that the CYP1A2 inhibition by ciprofloxacin is mediated by its metabolite desethylene ciprofloxacin.	755	757	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	CL
Background Despite the well-studied safety profile of dabigatran, its interactions with genetic polymorphism parameters are poorly understood, especially in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD). The study assessed whether genetic factors can contribute to CKD and alter dabigatran concentration. Methods Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and stage 3 CKD treated with dabigatran 110 or 150 mg have been included in the study. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene (rs1045642 and rs4148738) and CES1 gene (rs2244613). A plasma trough concentration/dose (C/D) ratio was used as a pharmacokinetic index. Results A total of 96 patients aged 51-89 years (median age: 75 years) were evaluated. Patients on a reduced regimen of 110 mg twice a day were older (79.8 vs. 67.9, p < 0.0001) and had lower creatinine clearance (49.7 vs. 62.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.015). Patients with the rs2244613 CC genotype had lower C/D values (70% reduction in the mean C/D vs. AA genotype, p = 0.001). Linear stepwise regression has shown the CKD epidemiology collaboration to be the only significant predictor of C/D among genetic factors and kidney function characteristics. During the median follow-up of 15 months, there were 15 bleedings in 13 patients. Conclusions Polymorphism of CES1 rs2244613 can contribute to the safety of dabigatran in patients with AF and CKD. There was no influence of the aforementioned polymorphisms of ABCB1 on dabigatran trough plasma concentrations and C/D. Kidney function is a mainstay of clinical decision-making on direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dose, and further knowledge should be accumulated on the role of genetic factors.	1626	1644	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral anticoagulant
The combination of budesonide and formoterol administered in one hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) is approved in the United States in two dosage strengths (budesonide/formoterol pMDI 80/4.5 microg x 2 inhalations [160/9 microg] or 160/4.5 microg x 2 inhalations [320/9 microg]) in a fixed-dose, twice-daily regimen for the treatment of patients > or =12 years old with persistent asthma not adequately controlled with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) alone. This article reviews the clinical profile of budesonide/formoterol pMDI in patients with persistent asthma, including information on pharmacogenetics, efficacy, and tolerability. Studies of budesonide/formoterol pMDI in patients with asthma were identified through PubMed and respiratory meeting abstract databases. Budesonide/formoterol pMDI 160/9 microg has shown a rapid onset (within 15 minutes) of clinically significant bronchodilation that is faster than fluticasone propionate/salmeterol dry powder inhaler (DPI) 250/50 microg (within 30 minutes). The efficacy and tolerability profile of budesonide/formoterol pMDI 320/9 microg was similar to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DPI 250/50 microg and budesonide/formoterol DPI 320/9 microg in adults and adolescents with persistent asthma. Short-term (12-week) and long-term (6- to 12-month) studies have established greater efficacy and similar tolerability of budesonide/formoterol pMDI compared with its monocomponents and placebo in patients with mild/moderate or moderate/severe persistent asthma. Studies evaluating patient-reported outcomes, including health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction with treatment, further support the benefits of budesonide/formoterol pMDI in patients with persistent asthma. In summary, budesonide/formoterol pMDI is an effective, well-tolerated treatment option for patients with persistent asthma for whom ICS/long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist combination therapy is appropriate.	65	82	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	hydrofluoroalkane
The treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in children has a high clinical success rate, although toxicological complications are frequent, and often result in the interruption of the treatment. Various studies have shown that toxicities resulting from the treatment are influenced by pharmacogenetic variants. Most of this research has focused on relatively homogeneous populations, and the influence of these variants in highly admixed populations, such as that of Brazil, is still poorly understood. The present study investigated the association between pharmacogenetic variants and severe toxicities in pediatric B-cell ALL patients from an admixed population of the Brazilian Amazon. The rs2306283 (of SLCO1B1) mutant allele increased the risk of neurotoxicity threefold, and the homozygous mutant rs9895420 (of ABCC3) genotype was associated with a fivefold increase in protection against severe gastrointestinal toxicity. This indicates that the rs2306283 and rs9895420 polymorphisms may be relevant to the prediction of severe toxicity in pediatric ALL patients.	912	928	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	gastrointestinal
Warfarin-induced bleeding complications and high inter-patient variability are major hindrances to oral anticoagulant therapy. The present study identifies the influence of VKORC1 diplotypes, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 variants on warfarin disposition and dose requirements in Chinese patients (n=107). The study subjects were genotyped for VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 polymorphic variants. Weekly warfarin dose requirements and S-warfarin clearance were stratified by VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 pharmacogenetics. The major VKORC1 diplotypes were H1-H1 (62%), H1-H7 (18%) and H1-H(*)(b) (10%). Warfarin dose requirements were significantly lower in patients with VKORC1 H1-H1 and H1-H(*)(a) diplotypes compared to patients harboring the H1-H7 and H1-H(*)(b) diplotypes (P<0.05). Hepatic tissues with H1-H1 diplotype had significantly lower expression of VKORC1 mRNA compared with liver tissues carrying the H1-H7 and H1-H(*)(b) diplotypes (P=0.006). The percent variability explained by VKORC1 diplotype status was 59.1% while the CYP2C9 genotype status accounted for 6.9% variability in warfarin dose requirements. Patient age and weight were significant covariates accounting for 29% and 8.6% of warfarin dose variability, respectively. The present study shows that VKORC1 diplotype status, CYP2C9 genotype, age and weight are significant covariates, accounting for 73.4% of interindividual variability in warfarin dose requirements among Chinese patients. Translation of these findings into clinical guidelines for warfarin dosing may be required to assess its impact on the safety and efficacy of warfarin.	99	117	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral anticoagulant
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) rank as one of the top 10 leading causes of death and illness in developed countries. ADRs show differential features depending upon genotype, age, sex, race, pathology, drug category, route of administration, and drug-drug interactions. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) provides the physician effective clues for optimizing drug efficacy and safety in major problems of health such as cardiovascular disease and associated disorders, cancer and brain disorders. Important aspects to be considered are also the impact of immunopharmacogenomics in cutaneous ADRs as well as the influence of genomic factors associated with COVID-19 and vaccination strategies. Major limitations for the routine use of PGx procedures for ADRs prevention are the lack of education and training in physicians and pharmacists, poor characterization of drug-related PGx, unspecific biomarkers of drug efficacy and toxicity, cost-effectiveness, administrative problems in health organizations, and insufficient regulation for the generalized use of PGx in the clinical setting. The implementation of PGx requires: (i) education of physicians and all other parties involved in the use and benefits of PGx; (ii) prospective studies to demonstrate the benefits of PGx genotyping; (iii) standardization of PGx procedures and development of clinical guidelines; (iv) NGS and microarrays to cover genes with high PGx potential; and (v) new regulations for PGx-related drug development and PGx drug labelling.	406	428	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	cardiovascular disease
Chronic calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-induced nephrotoxicity is associated with prolonged use of cyclosporine and tacrolimus and has been observed after all types of transplantation, as well as during treatment of autoimmune disease. Extensive alterations in the renal architecture including glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis may lead to end-stage renal failure. Increasing evidence shows that pharmacogenetic factors explain part of the between-patient differences in susceptibility to developing CNI-induced nephrotoxicity. In this paper this evidence is reviewed, with special emphasis on the role of genetic factors influencing metabolism and transportation of CNIs in both acceptor and donor.	261	279	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	renal architecture
The primary aim of the present study was to assess the possible associations between dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic system-related genes and adverse events after antipsychotic treatment in paranoid schizophrenia patients. The second aim of the study was to compare the intensity of these symptoms between atypical (ziprasidone and olanzapine) and typical (perazine) antipsychotic drugs. One-hundred and ninety-one Polish patients suffering from paranoid schizophrenia were genotyped for polymorphisms of DRD2, DAT1, COMT, MAOA, SERT, 5HT2A, and GRIK3. The patients were randomized to treatment with perazine, olanzapine or ziprasidone monotherapy for 3 months. The intensity of side effects (changes in body weights and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)) was measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. After 3 months of therapy, the weight increase was the greatest in the group treated with olanzapine and the least in the group treated with ziprasidone. None of the examined gene polymorphisms was associated with the body weight changes. Perazine treatment was associated with the significantly highest intensity of EPS. None of the examined polymorphisms was associated with the changes in extrapyramidal adverse events after antipsychotic treatment. The selected polymorphisms are not primarily involved in changes in body weights and EPS related to antipsychotic treatment in paranoid schizophrenia patients.	1230	1244	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	extrapyramidal
We summarize and discuss the studies presented at the congress of the American Association of Gastroenterology (Digestive Disease Week) that, in our opinion, are of greatest interest. Both clinically and physiopathologically, functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are highly complex. A single cause is unlikely to explain symptoms as heterogeneous as those of functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, it is easier (and more useful) to try to understand functional GI disorders using a bio-psycho-social model. Moreover, data supporting the combined importance of genetic, organic and psychological factors in the onset and persistence of functional GI disorders are increasingly convincing. This year, new data have been provided on pharmacogenetics in gastroparesis, on microinflammation or alterations in the modulation of somatic and visceral sensitivity in functional dyspepsia, and on the impact of psychological factors in IBS. From the therapeutic point of view, further information has been provided on the role of probiotics, the antinociceptive effect of linaclotide (demonstrated in several studies presented this year), and on the high efficacy of hypnotherapy in patients with IBS. Finally, data on the clinical management of patients with constipation due to pelvic floor dyssynergia and on the safety and efficacy of prucalopride in patients with severe constipation were also of interest.	376	385	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	dyspepsia

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used for acid suppression in the treatment and prevention of many conditions, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastric and duodenal ulcers, erosive esophagitis, Helicobacter pylori infection, and pathological hypersecretory conditions. Most PPIs are metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) into inactive metabolites, and CYP2C19 genotype has been linked to PPI exposure, efficacy, and adverse effects. We summarize the evidence from the literature and provide therapeutic recommendations for PPI prescribing based on CYP2C19 genotype (updates at www.cpicpgx.org). The potential benefits of using CYP2C19 genotype data to guide PPI therapy include (i) identifying patients with genotypes predictive of lower plasma exposure and prescribing them a higher dose that will increase the likelihood of efficacy, and (ii) identifying patients on chronic therapy with genotypes predictive of higher plasma exposure and prescribing them a decreased dose to minimize the risk of toxicity that is associated with long-term PPI use, particularly at higher plasma concentrations.	129	152	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	gastroesophageal reflux

Despite the over 20 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) now licensed for epilepsy treatment, seizures can be effectively controlled in about ∼70% of patients. Thus, epilepsy treatment is still challenging in about one third of patients and this may lead to a severe medically, physically, and socially disabling condition. However, there is clear evidence of heterogeneity of response to existing AEDs and a significant unmet need for effective intervention. A number of studies have shown that polymorphisms may influence the poor or inadequate therapeutic response as well as the occurrence of adverse effects. In addition, the new frontier of genomic technologies, including chromosome microarrays and next-generation sequencing, improved our understanding of the genetic architecture of epilepsies. Recent findings in some genetic epilepsy syndromes provide insights into mechanisms of epileptogenesis, unrevealing the role of a number of genes with different functions, such as ion channels, proteins associated to the vesical synaptic cycle or involved in energy metabolism. The rapid progress of high-throughput genomic sequencing and corresponding analysis tools in molecular diagnosis are revolutionizing the practice and it is a fact that for some monogenic epilepsies the molecular confirmation may influence the choice of the treatment. Moreover, the novel genetic methods, that are able to analyze all known genes at a reasonable price, are of paramount importance to discover novel therapeutic avenues and individualized (or precision) medicine.	1015	1031	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	vesical synaptic
The often-debilitating ulcers that develop on the feet of patients with diabetes (i.e., "diabetic foot ulcers") are among the most common types of chronic wounds. Their persistent failure to heal despite treatment is a significant cause of morbidity in a patient population often challenged by concomitant health conditions and quality-of-life issues. When a commercially manufactured therapy does not adequately heal such lesions, a compounded formulation may offer an effective alternative. In those customized medications, several drugs with different mechanisms of action can be combined in strengths or titrations compatible with each patient's pharmacogenomics profile, and the formulation of a compound can be easily altered as healing progresses and/or the patient's medical needs change. In this first in a series of 2 articles on compounding for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, the types, pathophysiologic causes, risk factors, and treatment of those lesions are discussed and formulations that promote their healing are provided. In part 2 of the series, differences in the healing of acute and chronic wounds are examined, the results of pharmacotherapy in treating diabetic foot ulcers are reviewed, the effectiveness of several drugs that promote chronic-wound healing is assessed, and additional formulations effective in treating nonhealing wounds are presented.	23	29	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	ulcers
