Acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH) is a serine protease involved in the recycling of amino acids from acylated peptides. Beyond that, APEH participates in the metabolism of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid; VPA) by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the VPA metabolite valproylglucuronide (VPA-G) to its aglycon. It has been shown that the inhibition of APEH by carbapenem antibiotics decreases therapeutic VPA levels by enhancing the urinary elimination of VPA in form of VPA-G. As various sequence variants of the APEH gene (which encodes the APEH protein) are listed in databases, but have not been functionally characterized yet, we assume, that some APEH sequence variants may have pharmacogenetic relevance due to their impaired cleavage of VPA-G. APEH sequence variants predicted to affect enzyme activity were selected from databases, and overexpressed in HEK293 cells (stable transfection), a cell line derived from human embryonic kidney cells. APEH activity in cell homogenates was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate N-acetyl-L-alanine-nitroanilide. APEH enzyme activity and protein expression of the sequence variants were compared with those of APEH with the reference sequence. Three out of five tested missense sequence variants resulted in a considerable decrease of enzyme activity assessed with the standard substrate N-acetyl-L-alanine-nitroanilide, suggesting an effect on pharmacokinetics of VPA. Our work underlines the need to consider the APEH genotype in investigations of altered VPA metabolism.	0	21	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	Acylpeptide hydrolase	Acylpeptide hydrolase

Three out of five tested missense sequence variants resulted in a considerable decrease of enzyme activity assessed with the standard substrate N-acetyl-L-alanine-nitroanilide, suggesting an effect on pharmacokinetics of VPA. Our work underlines the need to consider the APEH genotype in investigations of altered VPA metabolism.	918	927	CELL	cell line	cell line
Acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH) is a serine protease involved in the recycling of amino acids from acylated peptides. Beyond that, APEH participates in the metabolism of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid; VPA) by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the VPA metabolite valproylglucuronide (VPA-G) to its aglycon. It has been shown that the inhibition of APEH by carbapenem antibiotics decreases therapeutic VPA levels by enhancing the urinary elimination of VPA in form of VPA-G. As various sequence variants of the APEH gene (which encodes the APEH protein) are listed in databases, but have not been functionally characterized yet, we assume, that some APEH sequence variants may have pharmacogenetic relevance due to their impaired cleavage of VPA-G. APEH sequence variants predicted to affect enzyme activity were selected from databases, and overexpressed in HEK293 cells (stable transfection), a cell line derived from human embryonic kidney cells. APEH activity in cell homogenates was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate N-acetyl-L-alanine-nitroanilide.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the major pediatric cancer in developed countries. Although treatment outcome has improved owing to advances in chemotherapy, there is still a group of patients for which therapy fails while some patients experience severe toxicity. In the last few years, several pharmacogenetic studies have been performed to search for markers of outcome and toxicity in pediatric ALL. However, to date, TPMT is the only pharmacogenetic marker in ALL with clinical guidelines for drug dosing. In this article, we will provide an overview of the most important findings carried out in pharmacogenetics for pediatric ALL, such as the interest drawn by methotrexate transporters in the context of methotrexate treatment. Even if most of the studies are centered on coding genes, we will also point to new approaches focusing on noncoding regions and epigenetic variation that could be interesting for consideration in the near future.	0	28	CANCER	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia	Acute lymphoblastic leukemia

Apixaban and rivaroxaban are the two most prescribed direct factor Xa inhibitors. With the increased use of DOACs in real-world settings, safety and efficacy concerns have emerged, particularly regarding their concomitant use with other drugs. Increasing evidence highlights drug−drug interactions with CYP3A/P-gp modulators leading to adverse events. However, current recommendations for dose adjustment do not consider CYP3A/P-gp genotype and phenotype. We aimed to determine their impact on apixaban and rivaroxaban blood exposure. Three-hundred hospitalized patients were included. CYP3A and P-gp phenotypic activities were assessed by the metabolic ratio of midazolam and AUC0−6h of fexofenadine, respectively. Relevant CYP3A and ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms were also tested. Capillary blood samples collected at four time-points after apixaban or rivaroxaban administration allowed the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. According to the developed multivariable linear regression models, P-gp activity (p < 0.001) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) (p = 0.01) significantly affected apixaban AUC0−6h. P-gp activity (p < 0.001) also significantly impacted rivaroxaban AUC0−6h. The phenotypic switch (from normal to poor metabolizer) of P-gp led to an increase of apixaban and rivaroxaban AUC0−6h by 16% and 25%, respectively, equivalent to a decrease of 38 mL/min in CrCl according to the apixaban model. CYP3A phenotype and tested SNPs of CYP3A/P-gp had no significant impact. In conclusion, P-gp phenotypic activity, rather than known CYP3A/P-gp polymorphisms, could be relevant for dose adjustment.	0	8	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	Apixaban	Apixaban

According to the developed multivariable linear regression models, P-gp activity (p < 0.001) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) (p = 0.01) significantly affected apixaban AUC0−6h. P-gp activity (p < 0.001) also significantly impacted rivaroxaban AUC0−6h. The phenotypic switch (from normal to poor metabolizer) of P-gp led to an increase of apixaban and rivaroxaban AUC0−6h by 16% and 25%, respectively, equivalent to a decrease of 38 mL/min in CrCl according to the apixaban model. CYP3A phenotype and tested SNPs of CYP3A/P-gp had no significant impact. In conclusion, P-gp phenotypic activity, rather than known CYP3A/P-gp polymorphisms, could be relevant for dose adjustment.	1112	1116	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	P-gp	P-gp
Apixaban and rivaroxaban are the two most prescribed direct factor Xa inhibitors. With the increased use of DOACs in real-world settings, safety and efficacy concerns have emerged, particularly regarding their concomitant use with other drugs. Increasing evidence highlights drug−drug interactions with CYP3A/P-gp modulators leading to adverse events. However, current recommendations for dose adjustment do not consider CYP3A/P-gp genotype and phenotype. We aimed to determine their impact on apixaban and rivaroxaban blood exposure. Three-hundred hospitalized patients were included. CYP3A and P-gp phenotypic activities were assessed by the metabolic ratio of midazolam and AUC0−6h of fexofenadine, respectively.

Understanding gene-environment interactions that may influence disease is the cornerstone of a personalized medicine approach built on diagnostics, risk assessment/risk modification, pharmacogenetics and biology. Although genetic and personalized medicine can influence clinical decision making, currently most genetic information is based on populations of European ancestry. Additional human genome research must include diverse populations in order to assess the impact DNA sequence variation and environmental influences have on human disease risk. Within this article, we present a brief overview of human genome variation and discuss how epigenomics may influence gene expression. Examples of gene-environment interactions are explored and linked to several health disparities and health outcomes among communities of color. With the Jackson Heart Study poised to take the next steps in examining genes and the environment in ways that other cohorts cannot, we will be closer to a more inclusive personalized medicine goal that transforms medicine from curative to preemptive for all.	388	393	ORGANISM	human	human

Heart disease is a major cause of death in US and worldwide. The complex interplay of the mechanisms between diabetes, obesity and inflammation raises concerns for therapeutic understanding and developing treatment options for patients. Recent advances utilizing pharmacogenomics has helped researchers to probe in to disease pathophysiology and physicians to detect and, diagnose the disease in patients. The understanding developed in the area primarily addresses the issue focusing on the nature and asks the question 'Why' some individuals respond to the standard medication regimen and others do not. The central idea that genomics play a vital part in how the healthcare providers: physician, pharmacist, and nurse provide treatment utilizing the best practices available for maximum benefits. Pharmacogenomics is the scientific basis which offers the fundamental understanding for diseases, based on which therapeutic approaches can be designed and delivered. The discovery that not all humans respond to the drug in the same way is a 'paradigm shift' in how current therapies are offered. The area of pharmacogenomics at its core is linked to the genetic basis for the disease and the response to treatment. Given that diabetes and obesity are major metabolic ailments globally wherein patients also often suffer from cardiac disorders, a comprehensive genetic and pharmacogenomic understanding of these conditions enable the development of effective therapeutic strategies. In this review, we discuss various pharmacogenomic approaches with special emphasis on heart disease as it relates to diabetes and obesity.

The availability of high-throughput genotyping and sequencing platforms has largely removed technological barriers in the mapping the genetic determinants of drug response in human populations, and the set of validated pharmacogenetic variants is gradually increasing. Like the search for disease-susceptibility variation, however, many of the loci identified to date represent the relatively low-hanging fruit with large phenotypic effects but relatively low predictive power. Yet to be discovered is the larger set of variants, each with considerably weaker phenotypic effects, which together can be used to predict drug response more reliably and identify potential targets for novel drug development. Finding these pharmacogenetic variants is particularly challenging because sample size is typically far too small (and thus statistically underpowered) to detect genetic variants with weak effects. Studies of the genetics of gene expression (also described as expression quantitative locus (eQTL) mapping or genetical genomics) represent a novel approach for identification of functional genetic variants that influence gene expression. In these studies, individual gene transcript abundance as measured from expression microarrays are considered as discrete quantitative traits for genetic mapping that are intermediate to clinical outcomes of interest. Early studies using these methods have demonstrated improved power to detect such regulatory variants and have facilitated mapping of disease-susceptibility variants. The potential use of this approach in the study of pharmacogenetics and for the identification of potentially modifiable drug targets is reviewed here.	175	180	ORGANISM	human	human
The purpose of this pharmacokinetics (PK) study was to investigate whether different release kinetics from bupropion hydrochloride (HCl) immediate release (IR), sustained release (SR), and extended release (ER) formulations alter its metabolism and to test the hypothesis that the unsuccessful bioequivalence (BE) study of the higher strength (300 mg) of bupropion HCl ER tablets based on the successful BE study of the lower strength (150 mg) was due to metabolic saturation in the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen. A randomized six-way crossover study was conducted in healthy volunteers. During each period, subjects took a single dose of IR (75/100 mg), SR (100/150 mg), or ER (150/300 mg) formulations of bupropion HCl; plasma samples for PK analysis were collected from 0-96 h for all formulations. In addition, each subject's whole blood was collected for the genotyping of various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of bupropion's major metabolic enzymes. The data indicates that the relative bioavailability of the ER formulations was 72.3-78.8% compared with IR 75 mg. No differences were observed for ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) of metabolite to AUC of parent for the three major metabolites. The pharmacogenomics analysis suggested no statistically significant correlation between polymorphisms and PK parameters of the various formulations. Altogether, these data suggested that the different release kinetics of the formulations did not change metabolites-to-parent ratio. Therefore, the differing BE result between the 150 and 300 mg bupropion HCl ER tablets was unlikely due to the metabolic saturation in the GI lumen caused by different release patterns.	38	40	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	PK	PK

Altogether, these data suggested that the different release kinetics of the formulations did not change metabolites-to-parent ratio. Therefore, the differing BE result between the 150 and 300 mg bupropion HCl ER tablets was unlikely due to the metabolic saturation in the GI lumen caused by different release patterns.	1574	1576	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	ER	ER
Pancreatic cancer has the worst five-year survival rate of all malignancies due to its aggressive progression and resistance to therapy. Current therapies are limited to gemcitabine-based chemotherapeutics, surgery, and radiation. The current trend toward "personalized genomic medicine" has the potential to improve the treatment options for pancreatic cancer. Gene identification and genetic alterations like single nucleotide polymorphisms and mutations will allow physicians to predict the efficacy and toxicity of drugs, which could help diagnose pancreatic cancer, guide neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment, and evaluate patients' prognosis. This article reviews the multifaceted roles of genomics and pharmacogenomics in pancreatic cancer.	0	17	CANCER	Pancreatic cancer	Pancreatic cancer

The latest consensus has changed <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping among Chinese population, while its impact on metoprolol tolerance and adverse events in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases remains unclear. In this study, we prospectively included elderly patients who started metoprolol treatment for cardiovascular indications. According to the latest consensus on <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype-to-phenotype translation, the patients were categorized as normal, intermediate, or poor metabolizers (NMs, IMs, or PMs, respectively) by detecting the presence of the <i>CYP2D6*1</i>, <i>*2</i>, <i>*5</i>, <i>*10</i>, and <i>*14</i>. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation between the <i>CYP2D6</i> phenotype and incidence of adverse events, which were assessed over a 12-week period. In this study, there were 651 (62.7%) NMs, 385 (37.1%) IMs, and 3 (0.3%) PMs. After 12 weeks of follow-up, compared with NMs, IMs had the lower maintenance dose [50.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day vs. 25.0 (25.0-50.0) mg/day, <i>p</i> < 0.001] and lower weight-adjusted maintenance doses (0.52 ± 0.25 mg/day/kg vs. 0.42 ± 0.22 mg/day/kg, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and had higher incidence of postural hypotension (6.0% vs. 10.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.006), bradycardia (21.5% vs. 28.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.011), asystole (0.8% vs. 3.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.009) and syncope (2.0% vs. 6.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.001). In logistic regression model, the overall incidence of adverse events was 1.37-fold larger in IMs than in NMs (odds ratio = 1.37, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.79, <i>p</i> = 0.021). We conclude that IMs have lower tolerance and higher incidence of metoprolol-related adverse events than NMs in elderly Chinese patients with cardiovascular diseases. <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping is justifiable in elderly patients to minimize the risk of adverse events and ensure the benefits of metoprolol.	104	114	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	metoprolol	metoprolol

Combination drug therapies have become an integral part of precision oncology, and while evidence of clinical effectiveness continues to grow, the underlying mechanisms supporting synergy are poorly understood. Immortalized human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) have been proven as a particularly useful, scalable and low-cost model in pharmacogenetics research, and are suitable for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of synergistic combination therapies. In this review, we cover the advantages of LCLs in synergy pharmacogenomics and consider recent studies providing initial evidence of the utility of LCLs in synergy research. We also discuss several opportunities for LCL-based systems to address gaps in the research through the expansion of testing regimens, assessment of new drug classes and higher-order combinations, and utilization of integrated omics technologies.	224	255	ORGANISM	human lymphoblastoid cell lines	human lymphoblastoid cell lines

Antidepressants, mainly tricyclic and non-selective reuptake inhibitors of serotonin antidepressants, are part of the treatment of chronic pain. The management is complicated by a large interindividual variability of efficacy and tolerance. Important part of this variability is associated with nucleotide polymorphisms of genes encoding enzymes involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these molecules. Identification of these genetic variants could to predict clinical consequences and allowed individualized adjustments in medication or dosage. This article presents the current knowledge on the influence of genetics on the efficacy and adverse effects of antidepressants used in chronic pain treatment.	75	84	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	serotonin	serotonin

Warfarin is a cornerstone of oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Anticoagulation with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation is over twice as effective in secondary prevention of stroke as any other tested alternatives, including all other antithrombotic drugs or surgical interventions. General belief is that warfarin is capable of preventing 20 ischemic strokes for every hemorrhagic one it causes. However, warfarin is one of the most feared agents as a result of its woeful safety profile and difficulties in maintaining the proper daily dose. Recent research in pharmacogenetics predominantly focused on elucidating the influence of individual genetic predispositions to administered warfarin. Although the incorporation of genotype information improves the accuracy of adequate dose prediction, an improvement in anticoagulation control or a reduction in hemorrhagic complications has not been yet convincingly demonstrated. It is clear that identifying an individual patient's risk for hemorrhage on warfarin will require more broad clinical and genetic studies. Future research focused on patients with stroke should concentrate on defining the possible differences, especially focusing on predicting bleeding events in general and intracranial hemorrhages in particular. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing evidence about pharmacogenetics of warfarin in general, especially focusing on stroke prevention.	0	8	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	Warfarin	Warfarin

Obesity is a global epidemic that is a leading cause of preventable death. In addition to lifestyle modification, there are numerous obesity treatments for clinicians to consider, including medications. Lorcaserin immediate release/extended release (IR/XR) is a US Food and Drug Administration approved medication for overweight and obese patients to be used with lifestyle modifications. Lorcaserin is thought to reduce weight by targeting the serotonin (5HT<sub>2c</sub>) system to induce satiety. Lorcaserin IR has been shown to be effective in reducing weight in overweight (body mass index [BMI] > 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obese (BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participants in three large Phase III trials. In addition, lorcaserin has been shown to reduce post-cessation weight gain and improved smoking cessation in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. A recent meta-analysis suggested in overweight diabetic patients lorcaserin may be added to first-line oral hypoglycemic medications to enhance reduction in glycated hemoglobin. Lorcaserin is generally well tolerated with the most common side effect being headache, which is typically self-limiting. Lorcaserin XR (once daily) was recently approved and has been shown to be bioequivalent to lorcaserin IR (twice daily) in a pivotal study. Lorcaserin XRs, main advantage over the IR formulation is the once daily dosing regimen, which likely would lead to improved adherence and thus improved clinical effectiveness. The present review will evaluate the lorcaserin clinical studies (obesity, diabetes, and addiction), XR bioequivalence studies, pharmacogenomics of the serotonin (5HT<sub>2c</sub>) system, and adherence data in once daily versus twice daily medications.	203	213	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	Lorcaserin	Lorcaserin

Lorcaserin XRs, main advantage over the IR formulation is the once daily dosing regimen, which likely would lead to improved adherence and thus improved clinical effectiveness. The present review will evaluate the lorcaserin clinical studies (obesity, diabetes, and addiction), XR bioequivalence studies, pharmacogenomics of the serotonin (5HT<sub>2c</sub>) system, and adherence data in once daily versus twice daily medications.	960	964	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral	oral
Obesity is a global epidemic that is a leading cause of preventable death. In addition to lifestyle modification, there are numerous obesity treatments for clinicians to consider, including medications. Lorcaserin immediate release/extended release (IR/XR) is a US Food and Drug Administration approved medication for overweight and obese patients to be used with lifestyle modifications. Lorcaserin is thought to reduce weight by targeting the serotonin (5HT<sub>2c</sub>) system to induce satiety. Lorcaserin IR has been shown to be effective in reducing weight in overweight (body mass index [BMI] > 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and obese (BMI > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participants in three large Phase III trials. In addition, lorcaserin has been shown to reduce post-cessation weight gain and improved smoking cessation in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. A recent meta-analysis suggested in overweight diabetic patients lorcaserin may be added to first-line oral hypoglycemic medications to enhance reduction in glycated hemoglobin. Lorcaserin is generally well tolerated with the most common side effect being headache, which is typically self-limiting.

There is considerable inter-individual variability in the effectiveness and safety of pharmaceutical interventions. This phenomenon can be attributed to a multitude of factors; however, it is widely acknowledged that common genetic variation affecting drug absorption or metabolism play a substantial contributory role. This is a concept known as pharmacogenetics. Understanding how common genetic variants influence responses to medications, and using this knowledge to inform prescribing practice, could yield significant advantages for both patients and healthcare systems. Some health services around the world have introduced pharmacogenetics into routine practice, whereas others are less advanced along the implementation pathway. This chapter introduces the field of pharmacogenetics, the existing body of evidence, and discusses barriers to implementation. The chapter will specifically focus on efforts to introduce pharmacogenetics in the NHS, highlighting key challenges related to scale, informatics, and education.	544	552	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Prospective DPYD genotyping prevents severe fluoropyrimidine (FP)-induced toxicity by decreasing dosages in DPYD variant allele carriers. FP dosages in chemoradiation therapy (CRT) are lower than those in other FP-containing regimens. Pharmacogenetic guidelines do not distinguish between regimens, leaving physicians in doubt to apply dose reductions. Our aim was to investigate severe toxicity in DPYD variant allele carriers receiving CRT.	12	16	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	DPYD	DPYD

Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine interventions hold promise to optimize drug treatment modalities and hence, improve the quality of life of the patients by minimizing the occurrence of adverse drug reactions and/or maximizing drug treatment efficacy. To this end, proper guidance for accurately prescribing the correct drug at the right dose is empowered by major regulatory bodies, namely the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA), and well-recognized research consortia, like the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), that propose therapeutic recommendations after the thorough evaluation of the existing scientific evidence base. In this context, the consistency of these recommendations is crucial for smoothly integrating pharmacogenomics into the clinic. Here, we collected all of the important and clinically actionable pharmacogenomics information provided by the aforementioned renowned sources and documented it in order to assess potential similarities and, most importantly, differences. Our data show that the level of concordance regarding the guidance provided for the same drug-gene association pairs varies significantly, despite the fact that it all derives from a single evidence base. In particular, apart from the expected similarities in a number of association pairs, especially the ones related to cancer genomics, there are still major discrepancies that create confusion as to which guidance should be followed in order to properly inform drug prescribing. This regulatory deficiency calls for the fruitful engagement of the regulatory agencies involved with the contribution of other experts engaged in the field of pharmacogenomics in an effort to harmonize the existing arsenal of guidance for genome-informed drug prescription. The achievement of harmonization would in turn expedite bringing personalized medicine closer to clinical fruition.	154	162	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy has been the main treatment approach for stroke prevention for decades. Warfarin is the most widely prescribed OAC in the United States, but is difficult to manage due to variability in dose requirements across individuals. Pharmacogenomics may mitigate risk concerns related to warfarin use by fostering the opportunity to facilitate individualized medicine approaches to warfarin treatment (e.g., genome-guided dosing). While various economic evaluations exist examining the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics testing for warfarin, few observational studies exist to support these studies, with even fewer using genotype as the main exposure of interest. We examined a cohort of individuals initiating warfarin therapy between 2004 and 2017 and examined bleeding and cost outcomes for the year following initiation using Mayo Clinic's billing and administrative data, as well the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cost Data Warehouse. Analyses included descriptive summaries, comparison of characteristics across exposure groups, reporting of crude outcomes, and multivariate analyses. We included N = 1,143 patients for analyses. Just over a third of our study population (34.9%) carried a warfarin-sensitive phenotype. Sensitive individuals differed in their baseline characteristics by being of older age and having a higher number of comorbid conditions; myocardial infarction, diabetes, and cancer in particular. The occurrence of bleeding events was not significantly different across exposure groups. No significant differences across exposure groups existed in either the likelihood of incurring all-cause healthcare costs or in the magnitude of those costs. Warfarin-sensitive individuals were no more likely to utilize cardiovascular-related healthcare services; however, they had lower total and inpatient cardiovascular-related costs compared to warfarin-insensitive patients. No significant differences existed in any other categories of costs. We found limited evidence that warfarin-sensitive individuals have different healthcare spending than warfarin-insensitive individuals. Additional real-world studies are needed to support the traditional economic evaluations currently existing in the literature.	0	18	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Oral anticoagulant	Oral anticoagulant

While various economic evaluations exist examining the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics testing for warfarin, few observational studies exist to support these studies, with even fewer using genotype as the main exposure of interest. We examined a cohort of individuals initiating warfarin therapy between 2004 and 2017 and examined bleeding and cost outcomes for the year following initiation using Mayo Clinic's billing and administrative data, as well the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cost Data Warehouse. Analyses included descriptive summaries, comparison of characteristics across exposure groups, reporting of crude outcomes, and multivariate analyses. We included N = 1,143 patients for analyses. Just over a third of our study population (34.9%) carried a warfarin-sensitive phenotype. Sensitive individuals differed in their baseline characteristics by being of older age and having a higher number of comorbid conditions; myocardial infarction, diabetes, and cancer in particular. The occurrence of bleeding events was not significantly different across exposure groups. No significant differences across exposure groups existed in either the likelihood of incurring all-cause healthcare costs or in the magnitude of those costs. Warfarin-sensitive individuals were no more likely to utilize cardiovascular-related healthcare services; however, they had lower total and inpatient cardiovascular-related costs compared to warfarin-insensitive patients. No significant differences existed in any other categories of costs. We found limited evidence that warfarin-sensitive individuals have different healthcare spending than warfarin-insensitive individuals. Additional real-world studies are needed to support the traditional economic evaluations currently existing in the literature.	561	569	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	warfarin	warfarin

Previous studies have implicated 5-HT1A receptor gene (HTR1A) polymorphisms in the therapeutic response to antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A functional HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism (rs6295) in the promoter region was found to be associated with antidepressant pharmacogenetics in different populations. However, inconsistent and inconclusive results have been obtained. In this study, we tested whether rs6295 genetic variants are related to antidepressant effects using a meta-analysis method. The relevant literature was acquired through deliberate searching and selection based on the established inclusion criteria for publications. A total of 10 articles were identified, all of which evaluated the HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism and antidepressant response. Dominant and recessive models were tested in the analyses, and the results revealed no association between the HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism and antidepressant response.	33	48	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	5-HT1A receptor	5-HT1A receptor

Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors tonically inhibit colonic motility and the alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, given intravenously, increased colonic tone in humans. However, the effect of yohimbine on colonic transit in humans is unknown. In this study, 30 healthy volunteers were randomized to yohimbine 16.2 mg p.o. t.i.d. or identical placebo for 7 days. We evaluated gastric emptying, small intestinal, and colonic transit by scinitigraphy, bowel habits, haemodynamics and plasma catecholamines. As cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize yohimbine, P450 genotypes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) were determined in 25 of 30 subjects who consented to genetic studies. The relationship between drug metabolizer status predicted by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and effects of yohmibine were assessed. Compared to placebo, yohimbine increased (P < or = 0.02) diastolic blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline concentrations and maximum tolerated volume during the satiation test [yohimbine (1241 +/- 88, mean +/- SEM) vs placebo (1015 +/- 87), P = 0.054]. However, yohimbine did not affect gastrointestinal transit. Based on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 alleles, seven and 18 subjects were, respectively, extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of yohimbine. Compared to EM, PM of yohimbine had a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline (P = 0.1 for PM vs EM), lower maximum tolerated volumes (1120 +/- 95 vs 1484 + 131 mL, P = 0.02), and faster colonic transit (i.e. GC(24) was 3.0 +/- 0.4 vs 2.1 +/- 0.5, P = 0.1). These data suggest that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genotypes which determine the metabolism of yohimbine may influence its sympathetic and gastrointestinal effects.	0	28	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors	Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors

The relationship between drug metabolizer status predicted by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and effects of yohmibine were assessed. Compared to placebo, yohimbine increased (P < or = 0.02) diastolic blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline concentrations and maximum tolerated volume during the satiation test [yohimbine (1241 +/- 88, mean +/- SEM) vs placebo (1015 +/- 87), P = 0.054]. However, yohimbine did not affect gastrointestinal transit. Based on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 alleles, seven and 18 subjects were, respectively, extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of yohimbine. Compared to EM, PM of yohimbine had a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline (P = 0.1 for PM vs EM), lower maximum tolerated volumes (1120 +/- 95 vs 1484 + 131 mL, P = 0.02), and faster colonic transit (i.e. GC(24) was 3.0 +/- 0.4 vs 2.1 +/- 0.5, P = 0.1). These data suggest that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genotypes which determine the metabolism of yohimbine may influence its sympathetic and gastrointestinal effects.	192	201	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	yohimbine	yohimbine

We evaluated gastric emptying, small intestinal, and colonic transit by scinitigraphy, bowel habits, haemodynamics and plasma catecholamines. As cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize yohimbine, P450 genotypes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) were determined in 25 of 30 subjects who consented to genetic studies. The relationship between drug metabolizer status predicted by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and effects of yohmibine were assessed. Compared to placebo, yohimbine increased (P < or = 0.02) diastolic blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline concentrations and maximum tolerated volume during the satiation test [yohimbine (1241 +/- 88, mean +/- SEM) vs placebo (1015 +/- 87), P = 0.054]. However, yohimbine did not affect gastrointestinal transit. Based on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 alleles, seven and 18 subjects were, respectively, extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of yohimbine. Compared to EM, PM of yohimbine had a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline (P = 0.1 for PM vs EM), lower maximum tolerated volumes (1120 +/- 95 vs 1484 + 131 mL, P = 0.02), and faster colonic transit (i.e. GC(24) was 3.0 +/- 0.4 vs 2.1 +/- 0.5, P = 0.1). These data suggest that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genotypes which determine the metabolism of yohimbine may influence its sympathetic and gastrointestinal effects.	721	727	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	CYP2D6	CYP2D6

These data suggest that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 genotypes which determine the metabolism of yohimbine may influence its sympathetic and gastrointestinal effects.	1518	1524	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	CYP3A4	CYP3A4
Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors tonically inhibit colonic motility and the alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, given intravenously, increased colonic tone in humans. However, the effect of yohimbine on colonic transit in humans is unknown. In this study, 30 healthy volunteers were randomized to yohimbine 16.2 mg p.o. t.i.d. or identical placebo for 7 days. We evaluated gastric emptying, small intestinal, and colonic transit by scinitigraphy, bowel habits, haemodynamics and plasma catecholamines. As cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize yohimbine, P450 genotypes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) were determined in 25 of 30 subjects who consented to genetic studies. The relationship between drug metabolizer status predicted by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 and effects of yohmibine were assessed. Compared to placebo, yohimbine increased (P < or = 0.02) diastolic blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline concentrations and maximum tolerated volume during the satiation test [yohimbine (1241 +/- 88, mean +/- SEM) vs placebo (1015 +/- 87), P = 0.054]. However, yohimbine did not affect gastrointestinal transit. Based on CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 alleles, seven and 18 subjects were, respectively, extensive (EM) and poor (PM) metabolizers of yohimbine. Compared to EM, PM of yohimbine had a greater increase in plasma noradrenaline (P = 0.1 for PM vs EM), lower maximum tolerated volumes (1120 +/- 95 vs 1484 + 131 mL, P = 0.02), and faster colonic transit (i.e. GC(24) was 3.0 +/- 0.4 vs 2.1 +/- 0.5, P = 0.1).

Phenazepam is commonly administered to patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Some proportion of such patients do not show adequate response to treatment regimen containing phenazepam, whereas many of them experience type A adverse drug reactions. Previous studies showed that CYP2D6 IS involved in the biotransformation of phenazepam, the activity of which is highly dependent on the polymorphism of the gene encoding it. Objective. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of 1846G>A polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene on the concentration/dose indicator of phenazepam, using findings on enzymatic activity of CYP2D6 (as evaluated by the 6M-THBC/pinoline ratio measurement) and on CYP2D6 expression level obtained by measuring the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma concentration levels in patients suffering from major depressive disorder.	0	10	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	Phenazepam	Phenazepam

Esophageal cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies. Surgical resection of the tumor from the primary site has been the standard treatment, especially for localized squamous cell carcinoma, but considerable clinical efforts during the last decade have resulted in novel courses of treatment. These options include chemoradiotherapy, consisting of a continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin (CDDP), and concurrent radiation. Given the substantial inter- and/or intra-individual variation in clinical outcome, future improvements will likely require the incorporation of a novel anticancer drug, pharmacokinetically guided administration of CDDP or 5-FU, and identification of potential responders by patient genetic profiling prior to treatment. In this review, the latest information on incidence, risk factors, biomarkers, therapeutic strategies, and the pharmacokinetically guided or genotype-guided administration of CDDP and 5-FU is summarized for future individualization of esophageal cancer treatment.	0	17	CANCER	Esophageal cancer	Esophageal cancer

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) models can serve as a powerful framework for predicting the influence as well as the interaction of formulation, genetic polymorphism and co-medication on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug substances. In this study, flurbiprofen, a potent non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, was chosen as a model drug. Flurbiprofen has absolute bioavailability of ~95% and linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 50-300 mg. Its absorption is considered variable and complex, often associated with double peak phenomena, and its pharmacokinetics are characterized by high inter-subject variability, mainly due to its metabolism by the polymorphic CYP2C9 (fmCYP2C9 ≥ 0.71). In this study, by leveraging <i>in vitro, in silico</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data, an integrated PBPK/PD model with mechanistic absorption was developed and evaluated against clinical data from PK, PD, drug-drug and gene-drug interaction studies. The PBPK model successfully predicted (within 2-fold) 36 out of 38 observed concentration-time profiles of flurbiprofen as well as the CYP2C9 genetic effects after administration of different intravenous and oral dosage forms over a dose range of 40-300 mg in both Caucasian and Chinese healthy volunteers.

In addition, the drug-drug and drug-gene interactions were predicted within 1.5-fold of the observed interaction ratios (AUC, C<sub>max</sub> ratios). The validated PBPK model was further expanded by linking it to an inhibitory <i>E<sub>max</sub></i> model describing the analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen and applying it to explore the effect of formulation and genetic polymorphisms on the onset and duration of pain relief. This comprehensive PBPK/PD analysis, along with a detailed translational biopharmaceutic framework including appropriately designed biorelevant <i>in vitro</i> experiments and <i>in vitro-in vivo</i> extrapolation, provided mechanistic insight on the impact of formulation and genetic variations, two major determinants of the population variability, on the PK/PD of flurbiprofen. Clinically relevant specifications and potential dose adjustments were also proposed. Overall, the present work highlights the value of a translational PBPK/PD approach, tailored to target populations and genotypes, as an approach towards achieving personalized medicine.	296	308	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	flurbiprofen	flurbiprofen
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) models can serve as a powerful framework for predicting the influence as well as the interaction of formulation, genetic polymorphism and co-medication on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug substances. In this study, flurbiprofen, a potent non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, was chosen as a model drug. Flurbiprofen has absolute bioavailability of ~95% and linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 50-300 mg. Its absorption is considered variable and complex, often associated with double peak phenomena, and its pharmacokinetics are characterized by high inter-subject variability, mainly due to its metabolism by the polymorphic CYP2C9 (fmCYP2C9 ≥ 0.71). In this study, by leveraging <i>in vitro, in silico</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data, an integrated PBPK/PD model with mechanistic absorption was developed and evaluated against clinical data from PK, PD, drug-drug and gene-drug interaction studies. The PBPK model successfully predicted (within 2-fold) 36 out of 38 observed concentration-time profiles of flurbiprofen as well as the CYP2C9 genetic effects after administration of different intravenous and oral dosage forms over a dose range of 40-300 mg in both Caucasian and Chinese healthy volunteers.

The validated PBPK model was further expanded by linking it to an inhibitory <i>E<sub>max</sub></i> model describing the analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen and applying it to explore the effect of formulation and genetic polymorphisms on the onset and duration of pain relief. This comprehensive PBPK/PD analysis, along with a detailed translational biopharmaceutic framework including appropriately designed biorelevant <i>in vitro</i> experiments and <i>in vitro-in vivo</i> extrapolation, provided mechanistic insight on the impact of formulation and genetic variations, two major determinants of the population variability, on the PK/PD of flurbiprofen. Clinically relevant specifications and potential dose adjustments were also proposed. Overall, the present work highlights the value of a translational PBPK/PD approach, tailored to target populations and genotypes, as an approach towards achieving personalized medicine.	2205	2212	CANCER	vivo</i	vivo</i
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) models can serve as a powerful framework for predicting the influence as well as the interaction of formulation, genetic polymorphism and co-medication on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug substances. In this study, flurbiprofen, a potent non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, was chosen as a model drug. Flurbiprofen has absolute bioavailability of ~95% and linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 50-300 mg. Its absorption is considered variable and complex, often associated with double peak phenomena, and its pharmacokinetics are characterized by high inter-subject variability, mainly due to its metabolism by the polymorphic CYP2C9 (fmCYP2C9 ≥ 0.71). In this study, by leveraging <i>in vitro, in silico</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data, an integrated PBPK/PD model with mechanistic absorption was developed and evaluated against clinical data from PK, PD, drug-drug and gene-drug interaction studies. The PBPK model successfully predicted (within 2-fold) 36 out of 38 observed concentration-time profiles of flurbiprofen as well as the CYP2C9 genetic effects after administration of different intravenous and oral dosage forms over a dose range of 40-300 mg in both Caucasian and Chinese healthy volunteers. All model predictions for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub> and CL/F were within two-fold of their respective mean or geometric mean values, while 90% of the predictions of C<sub>max</sub>, 81% of the predictions of AUC<sub>inf</sub> and 74% of the predictions of Cl/F were within 1.25 fold.

The pharmacogenetics of antidepressants has been not only a challenging but also frustrating research field since its birth in the 1990s. Indeed, great expectations followed the first evidence of familiar aggregation of antidepressant response. Despite the progress from candidate gene studies to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), results fell out the expectations and they were often inconsistent. Anyway, the cumulative evidence supports the involvement of some genes and molecular pathways in antidepressant efficacy. The best single genes are SLC6A4, HTR2A, BDNF, GNB3, FKBP5, ABCB1, and cytochrome P450 genes (CYP2D6 and CYP2C19). Molecular pathways involved in inflammation and neuroplasticity show the greatest support. The first studies evaluating benefits of genotype-guided antidepressant treatments provided encouraging results and confirmed the relevance of SLC6A4, HTR2A, ABCB1, and cytochrome P450 genes. Further progress in genotyping and data analysis would allow to move forward and complete the understanding of antidepressant pharmacogenetics and its translation into clinical applications.	561	566	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	HTR2A	HTR2A

The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril is hydrolysed to an active metabolite, enalaprilat, in the liver via carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). Previous studies show that variant rs71647871 in the CES1 gene affects the pharmacokinetics of enalapril on liver samples as well as healthy volunteers. This study included 286 Caucasian patients with arterial hypertension who received enalapril. The concentrations of enalapril and enalaprilat were determined before subsequent intake of the drug and 4 h after it with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometric detection. The study included genetic markers as follows: rs2244613, rs71647871 (c.428G>A, p.G143E) and three SNPs indicating the presence of a subtype CES1A1c (rs12149368, rs111604615 and rs201577108). Mean peak and trough enalaprilat concentrations, adjusted by clinical variables, were significantly lower in CES1 rs2244613 heterozygotes (by 16.6% and 19.6%) and in CC homozygotes (by 32.7% and 41.4%) vs. the AA genotype. In CES1A1c homozygotes, adjusted mean enalaprilat concentrations were 75% lower vs. heterozygotes and wild-type (WT) homozygotes. Pharmacogenetic markers of the CES1 gene may be a promising predictor for individualisation when prescribing enalapril.	44	53	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	enalapril	enalapril

The study included genetic markers as follows: rs2244613, rs71647871 (c.428G>A, p.G143E) and three SNPs indicating the presence of a subtype CES1A1c (rs12149368, rs111604615 and rs201577108). Mean peak and trough enalaprilat concentrations, adjusted by clinical variables, were significantly lower in CES1 rs2244613 heterozygotes (by 16.6% and 19.6%) and in CC homozygotes (by 32.7% and 41.4%) vs. the AA genotype. In CES1A1c homozygotes, adjusted mean enalaprilat concentrations were 75% lower vs. heterozygotes and wild-type (WT) homozygotes. Pharmacogenetic markers of the CES1 gene may be a promising predictor for individualisation when prescribing enalapril.	386	395	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	enalapril	enalapril

Pharmacogenomics is about selecting the "right drug in the right amount for the right patient." In metastatic colorectal cancer, germline pharmacogenomics testing presents a unique opportunity to improve outcomes, since the genes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase metabolizing the chemotherapy drugs, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan are already well known. In a retrospective analysis of the landmark TRIBE clinical trial [(TRIBE - TRIplet plus BEvacizumab multicenter, phase III trial by the Italian Cooperative GONO (Gruppo Oncologico Nord Ovest) group (NCT00719797)], the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was higher in those with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase/UDP-glucuronosyltransferase aberrations and was dose dependent. We aimed to report on the feasibility and the results of incorporating pharmacogenomics testing into clinical practice.	86	93	ORGANISM	patient	patient

The pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus can be partly explained by CYP3A5 activity. Our objective was to evaluate a tacrolimus sparing policy on renal graft outcome according to <i>CYP3A5</i> 6986A>G genetic polymorphism. This retrospective study included 1114 recipients with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Genotyping of the 6986A>G allelic variant corresponding to <i>CYP3A5*3</i> was systematically performed. One year after transplantation, tacrolimus blood trough concentration (C0) target range was 5-7 ng/mL. However, daily dose was capped to 0.10 mg/kg/day regardless of the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype. A total 208 <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients were included. Despite a higher daily dose, <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients exhibited lower C0 during follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of <i>CYP3A5*1</i>/- genotype (HR = 0.70, 0.46-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.10) on patient-graft survival. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline was significantly lower for the <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> genotype did not significantly impact the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (HR = 1.01, 0.68-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.97) despite significantly lower C0. Based on our experience, a strategy of tacrolimus capping is associated with a better GFR evolution in <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients without any significant increase of BPAR incidence.

Our objective was to evaluate a tacrolimus sparing policy on renal graft outcome according to <i>CYP3A5</i> 6986A>G genetic polymorphism. This retrospective study included 1114 recipients with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Genotyping of the 6986A>G allelic variant corresponding to <i>CYP3A5*3</i> was systematically performed. One year after transplantation, tacrolimus blood trough concentration (C0) target range was 5-7 ng/mL. However, daily dose was capped to 0.10 mg/kg/day regardless of the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype. A total 208 <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients were included. Despite a higher daily dose, <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients exhibited lower C0 during follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of <i>CYP3A5*1</i>/- genotype (HR = 0.70, 0.46-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.10) on patient-graft survival. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline was significantly lower for the <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> genotype did not significantly impact the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (HR = 1.01, 0.68-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.97) despite significantly lower C0.

One year after transplantation, tacrolimus blood trough concentration (C0) target range was 5-7 ng/mL. However, daily dose was capped to 0.10 mg/kg/day regardless of the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype. A total 208 <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients were included. Despite a higher daily dose, <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients exhibited lower C0 during follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of <i>CYP3A5*1</i>/- genotype (HR = 0.70, 0.46-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.10) on patient-graft survival. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline was significantly lower for the <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> genotype did not significantly impact the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (HR = 1.01, 0.68-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.97) despite significantly lower C0. Based on our experience, a strategy of tacrolimus capping is associated with a better GFR evolution in <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients without any significant increase of BPAR incidence. Our study raised some issues about specific therapeutic tacrolimus C0 targets for <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients and suggests to set up randomized control studies in this specific population.	1276	1286	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	tacrolimus	tacrolimus

Over 10 million SNPs have been discovered to date as the result of both a private and public effort in the past two decades. Extensive investigations on SNPs have been performed to assess clinical applications for pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine. Recently, around the 10(th) anniversary of the first publication by the Human Genome Project, Hamburg and Collins addressed questions regarding the progress of the genomics field and its impact on pharmacogenomics / Personalized Medicine. Similar questions remain around the potential link of SNPs to Personalized Medicine applications, and the extent to which they have impacted "real world" clinical practices. Built upon these previous efforts, and to achieve our objectives of describing and assessing the role of SNPs and their impact on Personalized Medicine, this article analyzes and summarizes the clinical relevance, molecular mechanisms, clinical evidence, and preliminary regulatory and clinical guideline information of relevant SNPs. In addition, it focuses on two applications directly related to Personalized Medicine drug therapeutics: predictive biomarkers for patient stratification and dose selection. In summary, this article attempts to provide a general and comprehensive view of the role of SNPs in pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine, as well as a practical view of their impact on clinical practice today.	330	335	ORGANISM	Human	Human

Allogenic solid organ transplantation has become the routine procedure in patients with end stage organ disease. Although the transplanted organ compensates deficient body functions, its allogenic nature requires institution of immune tolerance, nowadays provided by immunosuppressive drug administration. Both the safety and efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment depend on many factors, and maintaining levels of immunosuppressants within therapeutic range is the essential target for success in graft function preservation. It is obvious that drug and metabolite concentrations depend on efficiency of individual patient metabolism. Recently, many studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between genetic factors, drug pharmacokinetics and therapy outcome, and interindividual variability apparently can be explained, at least in part, by genetically determined polymorphisms of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, transport proteins and also in some cases, drug targets. This review presents the recent state of knowledge in the field of pharmacogenetics related to solid organ transplantation.	10	21	CANCER	solid organ	solid organ

RNA interference (RNAi) is a process for regulating the gene expression in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silence target genes. siRNA-based therapy as a new molecular treatment approach, offers therapeutic prospects for many common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Nevertheless, the efficacy of siRNA delivery has, so far, remained a challenging issue. This is due to their easy degradation through the circulation system and the difficulties in the intracellular delivery to specific tissues where they silence the target genes. There have been many efforts to develop suitable, safe and effective siRNA delivery systems in the past decades. These efforts specifically aimed to protect siRNA from serum nucleases and deliver it to an intracellular region in the desired target cells. In this context, one of the new and popular approaches is nanovehicle-mediated siRNA delivery systems.	256	262	CANCER	cancer	cancer

Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.	0	7	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	Cocaine	Cocaine

Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.	352	355	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	COC	COC

Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.	979	991	TISSUE	brain tissue	brain tissue

Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing aided by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has the potential to improve medication-related outcomes in some individuals prescribed psychiatric medications. Many commonly prescribed psychiatric medications are metabolized through polymorphic drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome p450 (CYP) 2D6 (CYP2D6) and CYP2C19. Through PGx testing, clinicians can make biologically informed choices when selecting a new medication, and TDM may help inform dose adjustments or assess exposures to current treatments. Herein, we describe 2 complex case reports of individuals with multiple psychiatric diagnoses and extensive histories of medication failures who underwent PGx testing in addition to TDM as part of a pharmacist-led comprehensive medication therapy management evaluation in a community mental health clinic setting.	305	320	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	cytochrome p450	cytochrome p450

Precision medicine has the potential to transform healthcare by moving from one-size-fits-all to personalised treatment and care. This transition has been greatly facilitated through new high-throughput sequencing technologies that can provide the unique molecular profile of each individual patient, along with the rapid development of targeted therapies directed to the Achilles heels of each disease. To implement precision medicine approaches in healthcare, many countries have adopted national strategies and initiated genomic/precision medicine initiatives to provide equal access to all citizens. In other countries, such as Sweden, this has proven more difficult due to regionally organised healthcare. Using a bottom-up approach, key stakeholders from academia, healthcare, industry and patient organisations joined forces and formed Genomic Medicine Sweden (GMS), a national infrastructure for the implementation of precision medicine across the country. To achieve this, Genomic Medicine Centres have been established to provide regionally distributed genomic services, and a national informatics infrastructure has been built to allow secure data handling and sharing. GMS has a broad scope focusing on rare diseases, cancer, pharmacogenomics, infectious diseases and complex diseases, while also providing expertise in informatics, ethical and legal issues, health economy, industry collaboration and education. In this review, we summarise our experience in building a national infrastructure for precision medicine. We also provide key examples how precision medicine already has been successfully implemented within our focus areas. Finally, we bring up challenges and opportunities associated with precision medicine implementation, the importance of international collaboration, as well as the future perspective in the field of precision medicine.	292	299	ORGANISM	patient	patient

The optimal dose of warfarin depends on polymorphisms in the VKORC1 (the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit (1) and CYP2C9 (cytochrome P450 2C9) genes. To minimize the risk of adverse reactions, warfarin dosages should be adjusted according to results from rapid and simple monitoring methods. However, there are few pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithms that are based on large cohorts from the Chinese population, especially patients with atrial fibrillation. This study aimed to validate a pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithm based on results from a new rapid electrochemical detection method used in a multicenter study. Three SNPs (CYP2C9 *2, *3 and VKORC1 c.-1639G > A) were genotyped by electrochemical detection using a sandwich-type format that included a 3' short thiol capture probe and a 5' ferrocene-labeled signal probe. A total of 1285 samples from four clinical hospitals were evaluated. Concordance rates between the results from the electrochemical DNA biosensor and the sequencing test were 99.8%. The results for gene distribution showed that most Chinese patients had higher warfarin susceptibility because mutant-type and heterozygotes were present in the majority of subjects (99.4%) at locus c.-1639G > A. When the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium algorithm was used to estimate therapeutic dosages for 362 patients with AF and the values were compared with their actual dosages, the results revealed that 56.9% were similar to actual dosages (within the 20% range). A novel electrochemical detection method of CYP2C9 *2, *3and VKORC1 c.-1639G > A alleles was evaluated. The warfarin dosing algorithm based on data gathered from a large patient cohort can facilitate the reasonable and effective use of warfarin in Chinese patients with AF.	20	28	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	warfarin	warfarin

The optimal dose of warfarin depends on polymorphisms in the VKORC1 (the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit (1) and CYP2C9 (cytochrome P450 2C9) genes. To minimize the risk of adverse reactions, warfarin dosages should be adjusted according to results from rapid and simple monitoring methods. However, there are few pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithms that are based on large cohorts from the Chinese population, especially patients with atrial fibrillation.

A novel electrochemical detection method of CYP2C9 *2, *3and VKORC1 c.-1639G > A alleles was evaluated. The warfarin dosing algorithm based on data gathered from a large patient cohort can facilitate the reasonable and effective use of warfarin in Chinese patients with AF.	1651	1659	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	warfarin	warfarin
The optimal dose of warfarin depends on polymorphisms in the VKORC1 (the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit (1) and CYP2C9 (cytochrome P450 2C9) genes. To minimize the risk of adverse reactions, warfarin dosages should be adjusted according to results from rapid and simple monitoring methods. However, there are few pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithms that are based on large cohorts from the Chinese population, especially patients with atrial fibrillation. This study aimed to validate a pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing algorithm based on results from a new rapid electrochemical detection method used in a multicenter study. Three SNPs (CYP2C9 *2, *3 and VKORC1 c.-1639G > A) were genotyped by electrochemical detection using a sandwich-type format that included a 3' short thiol capture probe and a 5' ferrocene-labeled signal probe. A total of 1285 samples from four clinical hospitals were evaluated. Concordance rates between the results from the electrochemical DNA biosensor and the sequencing test were 99.8%.

Genetic factors associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) have been widely studied over the last decade. We examined whether genetic variants previously associated with BMI in the general population are associated with cardiometabolic parameter worsening in the psychiatric population receiving psychotropic drugs, a high-risk group for metabolic disturbances. Classification And Regression Trees (CARTs) were used as a tool capable of describing hierarchical associations, to pinpoint genetic variants best predicting worsening of cardiometabolic parameters (i.e total, HDL and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and blood pressure) following prescription of psychotropic drugs inducing weight gain in a discovery sample of 357 Caucasian patients. Significant findings were tested for replication in a second Caucasian psychiatric sample (n=140). SH2B1 rs3888190C>A was significantly associated with LDL levels in the discovery and in the replication sample, with A-allele carriers having 0.2mmol/l (p=0.005) and 0.36mmol/l (p=0.007) higher LDL levels compared to others, respectively. G-allele carriers of RABEP1 rs1000940A>G had lower fasting glucose levels compared to others in both samples (-0.16mmol/l; p<0.001 and -0.77mmol/l; p=0.03 respectively). The present study is the first to observe such associations in human subjects, which may in part be explained by a high risk towards dyslipidemia and diabetes in psychiatric patients receiving psychotropic treatments compared to population-based individuals. These results may therefore give new insight into the etiology of LDL-cholesterol and glucose regulation in psychiatric patients under psychotropic drug therapy.	567	570	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	HDL	HDL

Classification And Regression Trees (CARTs) were used as a tool capable of describing hierarchical associations, to pinpoint genetic variants best predicting worsening of cardiometabolic parameters (i.e total, HDL and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and blood pressure) following prescription of psychotropic drugs inducing weight gain in a discovery sample of 357 Caucasian patients. Significant findings were tested for replication in a second Caucasian psychiatric sample (n=140). SH2B1 rs3888190C>A was significantly associated with LDL levels in the discovery and in the replication sample, with A-allele carriers having 0.2mmol/l (p=0.005) and 0.36mmol/l (p=0.007) higher LDL levels compared to others, respectively. G-allele carriers of RABEP1 rs1000940A>G had lower fasting glucose levels compared to others in both samples (-0.16mmol/l; p<0.001 and -0.77mmol/l; p=0.03 respectively). The present study is the first to observe such associations in human subjects, which may in part be explained by a high risk towards dyslipidemia and diabetes in psychiatric patients receiving psychotropic treatments compared to population-based individuals. These results may therefore give new insight into the etiology of LDL-cholesterol and glucose regulation in psychiatric patients under psychotropic drug therapy.	1684	1692	ORGANISM	patients	patients

The threats involved in the long-term opioid treatment of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) have increased notably. Strategies to identify at-risk patients are important because there is no clear evidence showing which screening or deprescription programmes are appropriate. Our aim was to evaluate the evidence provided by pharmacogenetics applied to predict an analgesic toxicity profile in prescription opioid use disorder (POUD) patients participating in an opioid deprescription programme. Pharmacogenetic markers were analysed in an observational, prospective deprescription programme for POUD patients (n = 88) treated for CNCP. It consisted of monitoring visits (baseline, follow-up and final), opioid rotation or discontinuation and the recording of adverse events and suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Variants in OPRM1 (A118G), ABCB1 (C3435T), COMT (G472A), OPRD1 (T921C) and ARRB2 (C8622T) genes were tested by real-time PCR. Ethics committee approved the study. Wild-type OPRM1-AA genotype carriers reported a significantly higher number of adverse events than OPRM1-AG/GG (median [p25-75], 7 [5-11] vs 5 [3-9]), particularly gastrointestinal system events (90% vs 63%) such as nausea (33% vs 0%). Suspected ADRs (affecting 17% of the patients) were three times higher in males than in females (30% vs 11%). The deprescription programme was effective and safe, and it achieved a significant progressive reduction in the morphine equivalent daily dose, strong opioids and other analgesics' use, without causing any changes in pain intensity or opiate abstinence syndrome. OPRM1 gene polymorphisms could identify the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in POUD patients. Deprescription programmes including pharmacogenetic analysis should be considered during the follow-up of this population.	66	76	CANCER	non-cancer	non-cancer

The threats involved in the long-term opioid treatment of chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) have increased notably. Strategies to identify at-risk patients are important because there is no clear evidence showing which screening or deprescription programmes are appropriate. Our aim was to evaluate the evidence provided by pharmacogenetics applied to predict an analgesic toxicity profile in prescription opioid use disorder (POUD) patients participating in an opioid deprescription programme. Pharmacogenetic markers were analysed in an observational, prospective deprescription programme for POUD patients (n = 88) treated for CNCP. It consisted of monitoring visits (baseline, follow-up and final), opioid rotation or discontinuation and the recording of adverse events and suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Variants in OPRM1 (A118G), ABCB1 (C3435T), COMT (G472A), OPRD1 (T921C) and ARRB2 (C8622T) genes were tested by real-time PCR. Ethics committee approved the study. Wild-type OPRM1-AA genotype carriers reported a significantly higher number of adverse events than OPRM1-AG/GG (median [p25-75], 7 [5-11] vs 5 [3-9]), particularly gastrointestinal system events (90% vs 63%) such as nausea (33% vs 0%). Suspected ADRs (affecting 17% of the patients) were three times higher in males than in females (30% vs 11%). The deprescription programme was effective and safe, and it achieved a significant progressive reduction in the morphine equivalent daily dose, strong opioids and other analgesics' use, without causing any changes in pain intensity or opiate abstinence syndrome. OPRM1 gene polymorphisms could identify the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events in POUD patients. Deprescription programmes including pharmacogenetic analysis should be considered during the follow-up of this population.	1680	1688	ORGANISM	patients	patients
Recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the only drug used during the acute phase of stroke. Despite its important benefits, a percentage of patients suffer symptomatic hemorrhagic transformations or a lack of early recanalization rates. These undesirable effects are associated with acute neurological and long-term functional deterioration. For the past 20 years, pharmacogenetic studies have tried to find the genetic risk factors associated with rtPA response. Most of these studies have used a gene-candidate strategy; however, recent genome-wide association studies have emerged indicating that genetic predisposition could modulate rtPA response. This review summarizes the most interesting findings in this field, including which genes and genetic variations are associated with hemorrhagic transformations and recanalization rates after thrombolytic therapy.	12	30	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	tissue-plasminogen	tissue-plasminogen

In recent years, the term "personalized medicine" has been increasingly mentioned in relation to the endeavours to tailor the pharmaceutical as well as regimen therapy to the needs and requirements of individual patients. The personalization of antidiabetic treatment has undergone a dramatic advancement in relation to the expansion of knowledge about diabetes. From the empirical it moved forward to the phenotypic level which made it possible to differentiate between individual types of diabetes. The pathogenetic personalization which began to be used within Type 2 diabetes in the 1960s, was based on the assumption that while insulin resistance predominates in some patients, others are mainly affected by insulin secretion deficit. Biostatistics-personalized medicine (evidence based medicine) gathered evidence based on which metformin was included in recommendations on the therapy for Type 2 diabetes as a first-line drug. Although randomized studies during the first decade of the 21st century did not prove superiority of any other treatment modality as an adjunctive therapy used with metformin, they brought with them individualization of the goals of glycemic con-trol. At present, personalization is heading towards the pharmacogenetic level that will enable in the near future individualized therapy in terms of choice of first-, second- and third-line drugs depending on the panel of key gene polymorphisms which characterize sensitivity of an individual to specific antidiabetics. Finally, the "tailor-maded therapy" should be chosen based on a synthesis of pathogenetic, biostatistic and pharmacogenetic knowledge that will reflect the translation of results of the basic biomedical research into the clinical practice.Key words: evidence based medicine - pathogenesis - personalized therapy - pharmacogenetics - type 2 diabetes.	212	220	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Variation in gene expression has been found to be important in disease susceptibility and pharmacogenomics. Local and distant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) have been identified via genome-wide association study (GWAS); yet the functional analysis of these variants has been challenging. The aim of this study was to unravel the functional consequence of a gene with a local SNP with evidence for local and distant regulatory roles in cellular sensitivity to cisplatin, one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs. To this end, we measured cellular susceptibility to cisplatin in 176 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from Yoruba individuals from Ibadan, Nigeria. The 276 cytotoxicity-associated SNPs at the suggestive threshold of P ≤ 0.0001 were significantly enriched for eQTLs. Of these SNPs, we found one intronic SNP, rs17115814, that had a significant relationship with the expression level of its host gene, PRPF39 (P= 0.0007), and a significant correlation with the expression of over 100 distant transcripts (P ≤ 0.0001). Successful knockdown of PRPF39 expression using siRNA resulted in a significant increase in cisplatin resistance. We then measured the expression of 61 downstream targets after PRPF39 knockdown and found 53 gene targets had significant (P ≤ 0.05) expression changes. Included in the list of genes that significantly changed after PRPF39 knockdown were MAP3K4 and TFPD2, two important signaling genes previously shown to be relevant in cisplatin response. Thus, modulation of a local target gene identified through a GWAS was followed by a downstream cascade of gene expression changes resulting in greater resistance to cisplatin.	63	70	CANCER	disease	disease

The 276 cytotoxicity-associated SNPs at the suggestive threshold of P ≤ 0.0001 were significantly enriched for eQTLs. Of these SNPs, we found one intronic SNP, rs17115814, that had a significant relationship with the expression level of its host gene, PRPF39 (P= 0.0007), and a significant correlation with the expression of over 100 distant transcripts (P ≤ 0.0001). Successful knockdown of PRPF39 expression using siRNA resulted in a significant increase in cisplatin resistance. We then measured the expression of 61 downstream targets after PRPF39 knockdown and found 53 gene targets had significant (P ≤ 0.05) expression changes. Included in the list of genes that significantly changed after PRPF39 knockdown were MAP3K4 and TFPD2, two important signaling genes previously shown to be relevant in cisplatin response. Thus, modulation of a local target gene identified through a GWAS was followed by a downstream cascade of gene expression changes resulting in greater resistance to cisplatin.	1082	1088	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	PRPF39	PRPF39

Gender dysphoria is the imparity between a person's experienced gender and their birth-assigned gender. Gender transition is the process of adapting a person's sexual characteristics to match their experienced gender. The number of adults receiving sex hormone therapy for gender dysphoria is increasingly and these pharmacotherapies are increasing being prescribed in a general practice setting. The role of hormone therapy is to reverse or reduce physical sexual characteristics of the birth-assigned gender and enhance and build characteristics aligning to the expressed gender and these therapies apply to both transgender and gender nonconforming patients. Recognizing the options and interpreting the effects of gender transition therapies are fundamental to the discussion and treatment of gender dysphoria. This review summarizes pharmacodynamics, comparative dosing, adverse effects, monitoring, and potential pharmacogenetic influence of current pharmacotherapy. These include the use of 17-beta-estradiol, spironolactone, testosterone, GnRH agonists as well as adjunctive phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. The article also addresses gaps within the published literature including optimal routes of administration for individual patients, risks of malignancy and dosing reductions as transgender patients age.	652	660	ORGANISM	patients	patients

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are key membrane-embedded receptor proteins, with critical roles in cellular signal transduction. In the era of precision medicine, understanding the role of natural variants on GPCR function is critical, especially from a pharmacogenomics viewpoint. Studies involved in mapping variants to GPCR structures are briefly reviewed here. The endocannabinoid system involving the central nervous system (CNS), the human cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), is an important drug target and its variability has implications for disease susceptibility and altered drug and pain response. We have carried out a computational study to map deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) to CB1. CB1 mutations were computationally evaluated from neutral to deleterious, and the top twelve deleterious mutations, with structural information, were found to be either close to the ligand binding region or the G-protein binding site. We have mapped these to the active and inactive CB1 X-ray crystallographic structures to correlate variants with available phenotypic information. We have also carried out molecular dynamics simulations to functionally characterize four selected mutants.	0	27	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	G protein-coupled receptors	G protein-coupled receptors

Aminoglycosides are widely used antibiotics with notable side effects, such as nephrotoxicity, vestibulotoxicity, and sensorineural hearing loss (cochleotoxicity). MT-RNR1 is a gene that encodes the 12s rRNA subunit and is the mitochondrial homologue of the prokaryotic 16s rRNA. Some MT-RNR1 variants (i.e., m.1095T>C; m.1494C>T; m.1555A>G) more closely resemble the bacterial 16s rRNA subunit and result in increased risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. Use of aminoglycosides should be avoided in individuals with an MT-RNR1 variant associated with an increased risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss unless the high risk of permanent hearing loss is outweighed by the severity of infection and safe or effective alternative therapies are not available. We summarize evidence from the literature supporting this association and provide therapeutic recommendations for the use of aminoglycosides based on MT-RNR1 genotype (updates at https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/ and www.pharmgkb.org).	0	15	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	Aminoglycosides	Aminoglycosides

A postulated role of subcortical neuromodulators is to control brain states. Mechanisms by which different neuromodulators compete or cooperate at various temporal scales remain an open question. We investigated the interaction of acetylcholine (ACh) and oxytocin (OXT) at slow and fast timescales during various brain states. Although these neuromodulators fluctuated in parallel during NREM packets, transitions from NREM to REM were characterized by a surge of ACh but a continued decrease of OXT. OXT signaling lagged behind ACh. High ACh was correlated with population synchrony and gamma oscillations during active waking, whereas minimum ACh predicts sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs). Optogenetic control of ACh and OXT neurons confirmed the active role of these neuromodulators in the observed correlations. Synchronous hippocampal activity consistently reduced OXT activity, whereas inactivation of the lateral septum-hypothalamus path attenuated this effect. Our findings demonstrate how cooperative actions of these neuromodulators allow target circuits to perform specific functions.	21	48	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	subcortical neuromodulators	subcortical neuromodulators

That primaquine and other drugs can trigger acute haemolytic anaemia in subjects who have an inherited mutation of the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene has been known for over half a century: however, these events still occur, because when giving the drug either the G6PD status of a person is not known, or the risk of this potentially life-threatening complication is under-estimated. Here we review briefly the genetic basis of G6PD deficiency, and then the pathophysiology and the clinical features of drug-induced haemolysis; we also update the list of potentially haemolytic drugs (which includes rasburicase). It is now clear that it is not good practice to give one of these drugs before testing a person for his/her G6PD status, especially in populations in whom G6PD deficiency is common. We discuss therefore how G6PD testing can be done reconciling safety with cost; this is once again becoming of public health importance, as more countries are moving along the pathway of malaria elimination, that might require mass administration of primaquine. Finally, we sketch the triangular relationship between malaria, antimalarials such as primaquine, and G6PD deficiency: which is to some extent protective against malaria, but also a genetically determined hazard when taking primaquine.	5	15	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	primaquine	primaquine

That primaquine and other drugs can trigger acute haemolytic anaemia in subjects who have an inherited mutation of the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene has been known for over half a century: however, these events still occur, because when giving the drug either the G6PD status of a person is not known, or the risk of this potentially life-threatening complication is under-estimated. Here we review briefly the genetic basis of G6PD deficiency, and then the pathophysiology and the clinical features of drug-induced haemolysis; we also update the list of potentially haemolytic drugs (which includes rasburicase). It is now clear that it is not good practice to give one of these drugs before testing a person for his/her G6PD status, especially in populations in whom G6PD deficiency is common.

Optimizing antipsychotic pharmacotherapy is often challenging due to significant variability in effectiveness and tolerability. Genetic factors influencing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may contribute to some of this variability. Research studies have characterized these pharmacogenetic relationships, and some genetic markers are now available as clinical tests. These advances in pharmacogenetics research and test availability have great potential to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in psychiatric patients. For clinicians considering using pharmacogenetics, it is important to understand the clinical implications and also the limitations of markers included in currently available tests. This review focuses on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic gene variants that are currently available in commercial genetic testing panels. Associations of these variants with clinical efficacy and adverse effects, as well as other clinical implications, in antipsychotic pharmacotherapy are discussed.	524	532	ORGANISM	patients	patients
We report on our research in using literature-based discovery (LBD) to provide pharmacological and/or pharmacogenomic explanations for reported adverse drug effects. The goal of LBD is to generate novel and potentially useful hypotheses by analyzing the scientific literature and optionally some additional resources. Our assumption is that drugs have effects on some genes or proteins and that these genes or proteins are associated with the observed adverse effects. Therefore, by using LBD we try to find genes or proteins that link the drugs with the reported adverse effects. These genes or proteins can be used to provide insight into the processes causing the adverse effects. Initial results show that our method has the potential to assist in explaining reported adverse drug effects.	63	66	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	LBD	LBD

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and heterogeneous disorder characterized by remitting and relapsing periods of activity. Pharmacogenetics refers to the study of the effect of inheritance on individual variation in drug responses. Several drug-related markers in IBD patients have been identified in order to predict the response to medical treatment including biological therapy as well as the reduction of adverse events. In the future, the treatment of IBD should be personalized in its specific profile to provide the most efficacious treatment with lack of adverse events.	13	18	ORGAN	bowel	bowel

Metformin is recommended as first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) by all major diabetes guidelines. With appropriate usage it is safe and effective overall, but its efficacy and tolerability show considerable variation between individuals. It is a substrate for several drug transporters and polymorphisms in these transporter genes have shown effects on metformin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Areas covered: This article provides a review of the current status of the influence of transporter pharmacogenomics on metformin efficacy and tolerability. The transporter variants identified to have an important influence on the absorption, distribution, and elimination of metformin, particularly those in organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1, gene SLC22A1), are reviewed. Expert opinion: Candidate gene studies have shown that genetic variations in SLC22A1 and other drug transporters influence the pharmacokinetics, glycemic responses, and gastrointestinal intolerance to metformin, although results are somewhat discordant. Conversely, genome-wide association studies of metformin response have identified signals in the pharmacodynamic pathways rather than the transporters involved in metformin disposition. Currently, pharmacogenomic testing to predict metformin response and tolerability may not have a clinical role, but with additional data from larger studies and availability of safe and effective alternative antidiabetic agents, this is likely to change.	0	9	SIMPLE_CHEMICAL	Metformin	Metformin

Interindividual and interethnic variability of drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may be contributed by commonly occurring genetic polymorphisms of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Polymorphisms of CYP2D6 in particular have been associated with effects on tamoxifen disposition and clinical efficacy, with interethnic differences in distribution of functional alleles that affect metabolizer phenotype. Other tamoxifen-related genetic variants of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and sulfotransferase1A1 (SULT1A1) are also briefly reviewed here. Polymorphisms of CYP19A1 (aromatase gene) have been reported to correlate with clinical outcomes from aromatase inhibitors in small studies but require further confirmation. Many studies on chemotherapy are based on hypothesis-generating association studies and need to be validated through larger-scale cooperative group studies. For anthracyclines, polymorphisms in genes such as carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3), ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1), glutathione-related transporter genes, and oxidative stress-related genes have been reported to correlate with clinical outcomes. The pharmacogenetics of taxanes has been extensively investigated, but associations of genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters reported in earlier small studies have not been validated in a recent large clinical trial. Allelic variants associated with gemcitabine, capecitabine/5-fluorouracil, vinorelbine, and platinum disposition are reviewed. No pharmacogenetic studies have been published for targeted agents thus far, although several potential candidate genes warrant investigation. Future pharmacogenetic studies will need to focus on integration of multiple drug pathways to allow a more comprehensive analysis of genetic factors influencing drug efficacy and toxicity.	217	223	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	CYP2D6	CYP2D6

Other tamoxifen-related genetic variants of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and sulfotransferase1A1 (SULT1A1) are also briefly reviewed here. Polymorphisms of CYP19A1 (aromatase gene) have been reported to correlate with clinical outcomes from aromatase inhibitors in small studies but require further confirmation. Many studies on chemotherapy are based on hypothesis-generating association studies and need to be validated through larger-scale cooperative group studies. For anthracyclines, polymorphisms in genes such as carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3), ATP-binding cassette subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1), glutathione-related transporter genes, and oxidative stress-related genes have been reported to correlate with clinical outcomes. The pharmacogenetics of taxanes has been extensively investigated, but associations of genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters reported in earlier small studies have not been validated in a recent large clinical trial. Allelic variants associated with gemcitabine, capecitabine/5-fluorouracil, vinorelbine, and platinum disposition are reviewed. No pharmacogenetic studies have been published for targeted agents thus far, although several potential candidate genes warrant investigation. Future pharmacogenetic studies will need to focus on integration of multiple drug pathways to allow a more comprehensive analysis of genetic factors influencing drug efficacy and toxicity.	474	480	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	CYP3A5	CYP3A5

Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR) is a kind of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs). PDGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) which are small molecule inhibitors targeting PDGFR prevent and block cell proliferation signal transduction pathways. Recently, there have been 11 TKIs (including imatinib, sunitinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib and ponatinib) targeting PDGFR approved by FDA for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, renal cell carcinoma et al. Pharmacokinetics (PK) reflects the processes of drugs in body, while pharmacodynamics (PD) reflects the efficacy. Genetic polymorphisms of metabolizers and transporters contribute to highly inter-individual variability in PK and PD. This review aims to introduce the clinical applications, instruction and usage, PK, PD and pharmacogenetics of these PDGFR TKIs.	0	39	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor	Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor

Pharmacokinetics (PK) reflects the processes of drugs in body, while pharmacodynamics (PD) reflects the efficacy. Genetic polymorphisms of metabolizers and transporters contribute to highly inter-individual variability in PK and PD. This review aims to introduce the clinical applications, instruction and usage, PK, PD and pharmacogenetics of these PDGFR TKIs.	480	508	CANCER	chronic myelogenous leukemia	chronic myelogenous leukemia

Genotyping of gDNA rs12041331 (PEAR1), rs6065 (GP1BA), and rs730012 (LTC4S) can provide systematic guidance on the use of aspirin. However, an accurate, reliable and economical approach to simultaneous detection of the above single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is not reported. Herein, we designed and substantiated an allele-specific (AS) forward primer-superposed amplification analysis for measurement of the SNPs in PEAR1, GP1BA and LTC4S genes, in which the values of ∆Cq (differences in threshold cycles between the wild-type forward primer-based assay and the mutated-type forward primer-based assay) were employed to decide genotype. Mismatch AS forward primers were screened with the singleplex amplification analysis. Moreover, Cq extension optimized by AS forward primer superposition was observed in the selected forward primer-based triplex analysis. Further, robustness assessment of the triplex analysis showed the amplification efficiency ranging from 0.9 to 1.1. Precision test demonstrated the coefficient of variation of less than 2%. And the detective results of 189 DNA samples was completely concordant with that of commercial Sanger sequencing. In summary, we developed a simple, accurate and economical approach to genotyping of rs12041331 (PEAR1), rs6065 (GP1BA) and rs730012 (LTC4S) to provide a valuable pharmacogenomics tool for guidance of aspirin delivery.	14	18	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	gDNA	gDNA

Mental health problems are the leading cause of disability in Canadian workers. Medication ineffectiveness is hypothesized to increase the time to return-to-work in these workers. We assessed whether prescription changes based on pharmacogenomics profiling ( Report<sup>®</sup>) improved medication effectiveness in patients on mental health-related disability. In this retrospective cohort analyses, we assessed the impact of pharmacogenomic profiling on patient outcomes in 84 Canadian workers who were on a mental health-related disability between May 2018 and May 2019. All patients completed an informed consent form and a standard questionnaire including medical history, medications, disease symptoms, and medication side effects. Licensed pharmacists made recommendations for prescription changes in 83 patients. The main study outcome was medication effectiveness defined on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 being most effective and 10 being most ineffective) based on reported mood toward regular work tasks and medication side effects. We compared the medication effectiveness at baseline and at 3 months after the pharmacogenomics-based prescription changes. This retrospective cohort analyses included 46 patients who completed the follow-up questionnaires. Of them, 54% (<i>n</i> = 25) were females, 67% (n = 31) were Caucasians, and the mean age was 38 years (standard deviation [SD] = 11). The average baseline effectiveness score was 8.39 (SD =1.22). Following the prescription changes, the medication effectiveness scores significantly improved to an average of 2.30 (SD = 1.01) at 3 months of follow-up (effect size <i>r</i> = 0.62, <i>p</i> = <0.001). Pharmacogenomics could help in improving treatment outcomes in patients on mental health-related disability.	316	324	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Vinblastine and vincristine are dimeric indole alkaloids derived from Catharanthus roseus (formerly: Vinca rosea). Their monomeric precursor molecules are vindoline and catharanthine. While vinblastine and vincristine are well-known mitotic spindle poisons, not much is known about vindoline and catharanthine. Vindoline and catharanthine showed weak cytotoxicity, while vinblastine, vincristine, and the semisynthetic vindesine and vinorelbine revealed high cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. This may reflect a general biological principle of poisonous plants. Highly toxic compounds are not only active towards predators, but also towards plant tissues. Hence, plants need mechanisms to protect themselves from their own poisons. One evolutionary strategy to solve this problem is to generate less toxic precursors, which are dimerized to toxic end products when needed. As shown by in silico molecular docking and biochemical approaches, vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine bound with high affinity to α/β-tubulin and inhibited tubulin polymerization, whereas the effects of vindoline and catharanthine were weak. Similarly, vinblastine produced high fractions of mono- and multipolar mitotic spindles, while vindoline and catharanthine did only weakly affect bipolar mitotic spindle formation. Here, we show that vinblastine contributes to cell death by interference with spindle polarity. P-glycoprotein-overexpressing multidrug-resistant CEM/VCR1000 cells were highly resistant towards vincristine and cross-resistant to vinblastine, vindesine, and vinorelbine, but not or only weakly cross-resistant to vindoline and catharanthine. In addition to tubulin as primary target, microarray-based mRNA signatures of responsiveness of these compounds have been identified by COMPARE and signaling pathway profiling.	70	89	CELL	Catharanthus roseus	Catharanthus roseus
Vinblastine and vincristine are dimeric indole alkaloids derived from Catharanthus roseus (formerly: Vinca rosea). Their monomeric precursor molecules are vindoline and catharanthine. While vinblastine and vincristine are well-known mitotic spindle poisons, not much is known about vindoline and catharanthine. Vindoline and catharanthine showed weak cytotoxicity, while vinblastine, vincristine, and the semisynthetic vindesine and vinorelbine revealed high cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. This may reflect a general biological principle of poisonous plants. Highly toxic compounds are not only active towards predators, but also towards plant tissues. Hence, plants need mechanisms to protect themselves from their own poisons. One evolutionary strategy to solve this problem is to generate less toxic precursors, which are dimerized to toxic end products when needed. As shown by in silico molecular docking and biochemical approaches, vinblastine, vincristine and vinorelbine bound with high affinity to α/β-tubulin and inhibited tubulin polymerization, whereas the effects of vindoline and catharanthine were weak. Similarly, vinblastine produced high fractions of mono- and multipolar mitotic spindles, while vindoline and catharanthine did only weakly affect bipolar mitotic spindle formation. Here, we show that vinblastine contributes to cell death by interference with spindle polarity. P-glycoprotein-overexpressing multidrug-resistant CEM/VCR1000 cells were highly resistant towards vincristine and cross-resistant to vinblastine, vindesine, and vinorelbine, but not or only weakly cross-resistant to vindoline and catharanthine.

The key question of precision medicine is whether it is possible to find clinically actionable granularity in diagnosing disease and classifying patient risk. The advent of next-generation sequencing and the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) have provided clinicians and researchers a wealth of data and made possible the precise characterization of individual patient genotypes and phenotypes. Unstructured text-found in biomedical publications and clinical notes-is an important component of genotype and phenotype knowledge. Publications in the biomedical literature provide essential information for interpreting genetic data. Likewise, clinical notes contain the richest source of phenotype information in EHRs. Text mining can render these texts computationally accessible and support information extraction and hypothesis generation. This chapter reviews the mechanics of text mining in precision medicine and discusses several specific use cases, including database curation for personalized cancer medicine, patient outcome prediction from EHR-derived cohorts, and pharmacogenomic research. Taken as a whole, these use cases demonstrate how text mining enables effective utilization of existing knowledge sources and thus promotes increased value for patients and healthcare systems. Text mining is an indispensable tool for translating genotype-phenotype data into effective clinical care that will undoubtedly play an important role in the eventual realization of precision medicine.	145	152	ORGANISM	patient	patient

Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis is rapidly moving from a cutting-edge concept in genomics to a mature area of investigation, with important connections to genome-wide association studies for human disease, pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics. Despite the importance of the topic, many investigators must develop their own code or use tools not specifically suited for eQTL analysis. Convenient computational tools are becoming available, but they are not widely publicized, and investigators who are interested in discovery or eQTL, or in using them to interpret genome-wide association study results may have difficulty navigating the available resources. The purpose of this review is to help investigators find appropriate programs for eQTL analysis and interpretation.	211	216	ORGANISM	human	human
In recent years, the FDA has approved numerous anti-cancer drugs that are mutation-based for clinical use. These drugs have improved the precision of treatment and reduced adverse effects and side effects. Personalized therapy is a prominent and hot topic of current medicine and also represents the future direction of development. With the continuous advancements in gene sequencing and high-throughput screening, research and development strategies for personalized clinical drugs have developed rapidly. This review elaborates the recent personalized treatment strategies, which include artificial intelligence, multi-omics analysis, chemical proteomics, and computation-aided drug design. These technologies rely on the molecular classification of diseases, the global signaling network within organisms, and new models for all targets, which significantly support the development of personalized medicine. Meanwhile, we summarize chemical drugs, such as lorlatinib, osimertinib, and other natural products, that deliver personalized therapeutic effects based on genetic mutations. This review also highlights potential challenges in interpreting genetic mutations and combining drugs, while providing new ideas for the development of personalized medicine and pharmacogenomics in cancer study.	47	58	CANCER	anti-cancer	anti-cancer

Variability in hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes such as 2C19 and 2D6 may influence side-effect and efficacy outcomes for antipsychotics. Aripiprazole and risperidone are two commonly prescribed antipsychotics, metabolized primarily through CYP2D6. Here, we aimed to provide an overview of the effect of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 on side-effects of aripiprazole and risperidone, and expand on existing literature by critically examining methodological issues associated with pharmacogenetic studies. A PRISMA compliant search of six electronic databases (Pubmed, PsychInfo, Embase, Central, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) identified pharmacogenetic studies on aripiprazole and risperidone. 2007 publications were first identified, of which 34 were included. Quality of literature was estimated using Newcastle-Ottowa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) and revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The average NOS score was 5.8 (range: 3-8) for risperidone literature and 5 for aripiprazole (range: 4-6). All RCTs on aripiprazole were rated as high risk of bias, and four out of six for risperidone literature. Study populations ranged from healthy volunteers to inpatient individuals in psychiatric units and included adult and pediatric samples. All n = 34 studies examined CYP2D6. Only one study genotyped for CYP2C19 and found a positive association with neurological side-effects of risperidone. Most studies did not report any relationship between CYP2D6 and any side-effect outcome. Heterogeneity between and within studies limited the ability to synthesize data and draw definitive conclusions. Studies lacked statistical power due to small sample size, selective genotyping methods, and study design. Large-scale randomized trials with multiple measurements, providing robust evidence on this topic, are suggested.	15	38	CANCER	hepatic cytochrome P450	hepatic cytochrome P450

Only one study genotyped for CYP2C19 and found a positive association with neurological side-effects of risperidone. Most studies did not report any relationship between CYP2D6 and any side-effect outcome. Heterogeneity between and within studies limited the ability to synthesize data and draw definitive conclusions. Studies lacked statistical power due to small sample size, selective genotyping methods, and study design. Large-scale randomized trials with multiple measurements, providing robust evidence on this topic, are suggested.	308	315	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	CYP2C19	CYP2C19
Variability in hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes such as 2C19 and 2D6 may influence side-effect and efficacy outcomes for antipsychotics. Aripiprazole and risperidone are two commonly prescribed antipsychotics, metabolized primarily through CYP2D6. Here, we aimed to provide an overview of the effect of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 on side-effects of aripiprazole and risperidone, and expand on existing literature by critically examining methodological issues associated with pharmacogenetic studies. A PRISMA compliant search of six electronic databases (Pubmed, PsychInfo, Embase, Central, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) identified pharmacogenetic studies on aripiprazole and risperidone. 2007 publications were first identified, of which 34 were included. Quality of literature was estimated using Newcastle-Ottowa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) and revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The average NOS score was 5.8 (range: 3-8) for risperidone literature and 5 for aripiprazole (range: 4-6).

Recent studies have been established high degree of genetic diversity in solid organ tumors among individuals and even between individual tumor cells. This intratumor and intertumor genetic diversity results in a heterogeneous tumor with unique characteristics which potentially allows effective drug therapy. The goal of pharmacogenomics is to elucidate the genetic network(s) that underlie drug efficacy and drug resistance. Advances in targeted and personalized therapy play an increasingly important role in many common cancers, notably lung cancer, due to the high incidence, prevalence, mortality and the greater tendency towards drug resistance seen in these patients. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and or downstream kinase pathways. This has led to the development of highly selective monoclonal antibodies and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) to prevent cancer initiation, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, survival, and invasion. However, resistance to many of these new treatments is induced and further pharmacogenomic analysis has revealed mutations associated with increased or reduced drug efficacy. Combinations of kinase inhibitors or potentially the targeting of cancer stem cells may further increase the success of pharmacogenomics in treating patients with lung cancer.	73	91	CANCER	solid organ tumors	solid organ tumors

To document determinants of O-demethylation in critically ill (pre)term neonates and infants, tramadol (M) and O-demethyl tramadol (M1) concentrations were quantified in eighty-six 24 h urine collections and 168 plasma samples. A significant correlation of urine log M/M1 (0.98, SD 0.66) and plasma log M/M1 (0.78, SD 0.45) with postmenstrual age (PMA) (r = -0.69 and -0.65) was observed. One-way analysis of variance documented a significant decrease in urine log and plasma log M/M1 with increasing CYP2D6 activity score (F value 11.6 and 22.55). PMA and CYP2D6 activity score determined the urine and plasma log M/M1 (R 0.59 and 0.64) in a forward multiple regression model. We therefore conclude that PMA and CYP2D6 polymorphisms determined O-demethylation activity in (pre)term neonates and young infants, illustrating the impact of pharmacogenetics on drug metabolism in neonates although a relevant part of the interindividual varaibility remained unexplained. Besides compound-specific relevance, CYP2D6 iso-enzyme specific data on in vivo ontogeny of O-demethylation can contribute to safer and more effective administration of drugs metabolized by the same route in this population.	132	134	CELL	M1	M1

A significant correlation of urine log M/M1 (0.98, SD 0.66) and plasma log M/M1 (0.78, SD 0.45) with postmenstrual age (PMA) (r = -0.69 and -0.65) was observed. One-way analysis of variance documented a significant decrease in urine log and plasma log M/M1 with increasing CYP2D6 activity score (F value 11.6 and 22.55). PMA and CYP2D6 activity score determined the urine and plasma log M/M1 (R 0.59 and 0.64) in a forward multiple regression model. We therefore conclude that PMA and CYP2D6 polymorphisms determined O-demethylation activity in (pre)term neonates and young infants, illustrating the impact of pharmacogenetics on drug metabolism in neonates although a relevant part of the interindividual varaibility remained unexplained. Besides compound-specific relevance, CYP2D6 iso-enzyme specific data on in vivo ontogeny of O-demethylation can contribute to safer and more effective administration of drugs metabolized by the same route in this population.	594	599	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	urine	urine

Genetic variations in the human cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 (<i>CYP2C9)</i> and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily D member 6 (<i>CYP2D6)</i> genes may affect drug metabolism and lead to alterations in phenotypes. Genetic variations are associated with toxicity, adverse drug reactions, inefficient treatment. Various <i>in silico</i> tools were combined to investigate the deleterious effects of missense non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) of the human <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i>. The structural and functional effects of the high-risk non-synonymous SNPs in the human <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i> were predicted by numerous computational mutation analysis methods. Out of 24 pathogenic missense SNPs in the <i>CYP2C9</i>, 22 nsSNPs had a decreasing effect on protein stability and 13 SNPs were showed to be located at conserved positions. Out of 27 high-risk deleterious non-synonymous SNPs in the human <i>CYP2D6</i>, 21 SNPs decreased protein stability and 16 nsSNPs were predicted to be positioned at conserved regions. Our present study suggests that the identified functional SNPs may affect drug metabolism associated with CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 enzymes.	26	81	ORGANISM	human cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 (<i	human cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 (<i

Effective management of sickle cell pain entails a thorough understanding of its pathophysiology and the pharmacogenomics of the opioids used to manage it. In recent years, there has been significant progress along these two lines. At the pathophysiologic level, there is evidence that the severity and frequency of painful stimuli modulate their transmission at the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This modulation is achieved via two channels: the α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and NMDA receptors. Initially, the AMPA channel controls the transmission of stimuli of mild-moderate severity. Once the AMPA channel reaches its limit of membrane depolarization, the NMDA channel is activated and facilitates the transmission of painful stimuli in a progressive fashion leading to central sensitization and glial activation. At the level of pharmacogenomics, the metabolism of each opioid is patient-specific. Glucuronidation is unique for the metabolism of morphine, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone. The metabolism of all other opioids requires specific Cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes. The activity of each isoenzyme and the activity of the metabolites of each opioid vary among patients depending on their genetic makeup and coexistent environmental factors such as the use of other medications that may enhance or inhibit the CYP isoenzyme activity.	31	35	CELL	cell	cell

Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, consuming a significant proportion of public health spending. Oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) are the frontline treatment approaches after lifestyle changes. However, huge interindividual variation in response to OHAs results in unnecessary treatment failure. In addition to nongenetic factors, genetic factors are thought to contribute to much of such variability, highlighting the importance of the potential of pharmacogenetics to improve therapeutic outcome. Despite the presence of conflicting results, significant progress has been made in an effort to identify the genetic markers associated with pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and ultimately therapeutic response and/or adverse outcomes to OHAs. As such, this article presents a comprehensive review of current knowledge on pharmacogenetics of OHAs and provides insights into knowledge gaps and future directions.	135	139	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	Oral	Oral
One of the unsolved mysteries of medicine is how do volatile anesthetics (VAs) cause a patient to reversibly lose consciousness. In addition, identifying mechanisms for the collateral effects of VAs, including anesthetic-induced neurotoxicity (AiN) and anesthetic preconditioning (AP), has proven challenging. Multiple classes of molecules (lipids, proteins, and water) have been considered as potential VA targets, but recently proteins have received the most attention. Studies targeting neuronal receptors or ion channels had limited success in identifying the critical targets of VAs mediating either the phenotype of "anesthesia" or their collateral effects. Recent studies in both nematodes and fruit flies may provide a paradigm shift by suggesting that mitochondria may harbor the upstream molecular switch activating both primary and collateral effects. The disruption of a specific step of electron transfer within the mitochondrion causes hypersensitivity to VAs, from nematodes to <i>Drosophila</i> and to humans, while also modulating the sensitivity to collateral effects. The downstream effects from mitochondrial inhibition are potentially legion, but inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter cycling appears to be specifically sensitive to the mitochondrial effects. These findings are perhaps of even broader interest since two recent reports indicate that mitochondrial damage may well underlie neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of VAs in the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, important to understand how anesthetics interact with mitochondria to affect CNS function, not just for the desired facets of general anesthesia but also for significant collateral effects, both harmful and beneficial. A tantalizing possibility exists that both the primary (anesthesia) and secondary (AiN, AP) mechanisms may at least partially overlap in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).	87	94	ORGANISM	patient	patient

Recent studies in both nematodes and fruit flies may provide a paradigm shift by suggesting that mitochondria may harbor the upstream molecular switch activating both primary and collateral effects. The disruption of a specific step of electron transfer within the mitochondrion causes hypersensitivity to VAs, from nematodes to <i>Drosophila</i> and to humans, while also modulating the sensitivity to collateral effects. The downstream effects from mitochondrial inhibition are potentially legion, but inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter cycling appears to be specifically sensitive to the mitochondrial effects. These findings are perhaps of even broader interest since two recent reports indicate that mitochondrial damage may well underlie neurotoxic and neuroprotective effects of VAs in the central nervous system (CNS). It is, therefore, important to understand how anesthetics interact with mitochondria to affect CNS function, not just for the desired facets of general anesthesia but also for significant collateral effects, both harmful and beneficial.

The use of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) has become an integral part of supportive care during cytotoxic chemotherapy. Current guidelines recommend the use of G-CSF in patients with substantial risk of febrile neutropenia. However, little consensus exists about optimal timing and tailoring of this therapy. Based on the known effects of chemotherapy and G-CSF on bone marrow compartments, we propose a model that supports the prophylactic rather than therapeutic use of G-CSF therapy. In addition, several genetic alterations in G-CSF signalling pathway have been described. These genetic variants may predict the risk of febrile neutropenia and response to G-CSF. Thus, future pharmacogenetic/omics studies in this field are warranted. Through the identification of patients at risk and the knowledge of biological basis for optimal timing, hopefully we should soon be able to improve the application of the existing guidelines for G-CSF therapy and patient's prognosis.	23	67	ORGANISM	human granulocyte colony stimulating factors	human granulocyte colony stimulating factors

The use of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) has become an integral part of supportive care during cytotoxic chemotherapy. Current guidelines recommend the use of G-CSF in patients with substantial risk of febrile neutropenia. However, little consensus exists about optimal timing and tailoring of this therapy. Based on the known effects of chemotherapy and G-CSF on bone marrow compartments, we propose a model that supports the prophylactic rather than therapeutic use of G-CSF therapy.

This article surveys efforts on text mining of the pharmacogenomics literature, mainly from the period 2008 to 2011. Pharmacogenomics (or pharmacogenetics) is the field that studies how human genetic variation impacts drug response. Therefore, publications span the intersection of research in genotypes, phenotypes and pharmacology, a topic that has increasingly become a focus of active research in recent years. This survey covers efforts dealing with the automatic recognition of relevant named entities (e.g. genes, gene variants and proteins, diseases and other pathological phenomena, drugs and other chemicals relevant for medical treatment), as well as various forms of relations between them. A wide range of text genres is considered, such as scientific publications (abstracts, as well as full texts), patent texts and clinical narratives. We also discuss infrastructure and resources needed for advanced text analytics, e.g. document corpora annotated with corresponding semantic metadata (gold standards and training data), biomedical terminologies and ontologies providing domain-specific background knowledge at different levels of formality and specificity, software architectures for building complex and scalable text analytics pipelines and Web services grounded to them, as well as comprehensive ways to disseminate and interact with the typically huge amounts of semiformal knowledge structures extracted by text mining tools. Finally, we consider some of the novel applications that have already been developed in the field of pharmacogenomic text mining and point out perspectives for future research.	186	191	ORGANISM	human	human

<b>Introduction:</b> Research in the field of pharmacogenomics (PGx) aims to identify genetic variants that modulate response to drugs, through alterations in their pharmacokinetics (PK) or pharmacodynamics (PD). The distribution of PGx variants differs considerably among populations, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) plays a major role as a comprehensive approach to detect both common and rare variants. This study evaluated the frequency of PGx markers in the context of the Brazilian population, using data from a population-based admixed cohort from Sao Paulo, Brazil, which includes variants from WGS of 1,171 unrelated, elderly individuals. <b>Methods:</b> The Stargazer tool was used to call star alleles and structural variants (SVs) from 38 pharmacogenes. Clinically relevant variants were investigated, and the predicted drug response phenotype was analyzed in combination with the medication record to assess individuals potentially at high-risk of gene-drug interaction. <b>Results:</b> In total, 352 unique star alleles or haplotypes were observed, of which 255 and 199 had a frequency < 0.05 and < 0.01, respectively. For star alleles with frequency > 5% (<i>n</i> = 97), decreased, loss-of-function and unknown function accounted for 13.4%, 8.2% and 27.8% of alleles or haplotypes, respectively. Structural variants (SVs) were identified in 35 genes for at least one individual, and occurred with frequencies >5% for CYP2D6, CYP2A6, GSTM1, and UGT2B17. Overall 98.0% of the individuals carried at least one high risk genotype-predicted phenotype in pharmacogenes with PharmGKB level of evidence 1A for drug interaction. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) Priority Result Notation and the cohort medication registry were combined to assess high-risk gene-drug interactions. In general, 42.0% of the cohort used at least one PharmGKB evidence level 1A drug, and 18.9% of individuals who used PharmGKB evidence level 1A drugs had a genotype-predicted phenotype of high-risk gene-drug interaction. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study described the applicability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques for translating PGx variants into clinically relevant phenotypes on a large scale in the Brazilian population and explores the feasibility of systematic adoption of PGx testing in Brazil.	1	2	CELL	b	b

Clinically relevant variants were investigated, and the predicted drug response phenotype was analyzed in combination with the medication record to assess individuals potentially at high-risk of gene-drug interaction. <b>Results:</b> In total, 352 unique star alleles or haplotypes were observed, of which 255 and 199 had a frequency < 0.05 and < 0.01, respectively. For star alleles with frequency > 5% (<i>n</i> = 97), decreased, loss-of-function and unknown function accounted for 13.4%, 8.2% and 27.8% of alleles or haplotypes, respectively. Structural variants (SVs) were identified in 35 genes for at least one individual, and occurred with frequencies >5% for CYP2D6, CYP2A6, GSTM1, and UGT2B17. Overall 98.0% of the individuals carried at least one high risk genotype-predicted phenotype in pharmacogenes with PharmGKB level of evidence 1A for drug interaction. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) Priority Result Notation and the cohort medication registry were combined to assess high-risk gene-drug interactions. In general, 42.0% of the cohort used at least one PharmGKB evidence level 1A drug, and 18.9% of individuals who used PharmGKB evidence level 1A drugs had a genotype-predicted phenotype of high-risk gene-drug interaction. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study described the applicability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques for translating PGx variants into clinically relevant phenotypes on a large scale in the Brazilian population and explores the feasibility of systematic adoption of PGx testing in Brazil.	1451	1456	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	GSTM1	GSTM1

Breast cancer arises as a result of multiple interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Conventionally, breast cancer is treated based on histopathological and clinical features. DNA technologies like the human genome microarray are now partially integrated into clinical practice and are used for developing new "personalized medicines" and "pharmacogenetics" for improving the efficiency and safety of cancer medications. We investigated the effects of four established therapies-for ER+ ductal breast cancer-on the differential gene expression. The therapies included single agent tamoxifen, two-agent docetaxel and capecitabine, or combined three-agents CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil) and CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). Genevestigator 8.1.0 was used to compare five datasets from patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, untreated or treated with selected drugs, to those from the healthy control. We identified 74 differentially expressed genes involved in three pathways, i.e., apoptosis (extrinsic and intrinsic), oxidative signaling, and PI3K/Akt signaling. The treatments affected the expression of apoptotic genes (<i>TNFRSF10B</i> [<i>TRAIL</i>], <i>FAS</i>, <i>CASP3/6/7/8</i>, <i>PMAIP1</i> [<i>NOXA</i>], <i>BNIP3L</i>, <i>BNIP3</i>, <i>BCL2A1</i>, and <i>BCL2</i>), the oxidative stress-related genes (<i>NOX4</i>, <i>XDH</i>, <i>MAOA</i>, <i>GSR</i>, <i>GPX3</i>, and <i>SOD3</i>), and the PI3K/Akt pathway gene (<i>ERBB2</i> [<i>HER2</i>]).

The treatments affected the expression of apoptotic genes (<i>TNFRSF10B</i> [<i>TRAIL</i>], <i>FAS</i>, <i>CASP3/6/7/8</i>, <i>PMAIP1</i> [<i>NOXA</i>], <i>BNIP3L</i>, <i>BNIP3</i>, <i>BCL2A1</i>, and <i>BCL2</i>), the oxidative stress-related genes (<i>NOX4</i>, <i>XDH</i>, <i>MAOA</i>, <i>GSR</i>, <i>GPX3</i>, and <i>SOD3</i>), and the PI3K/Akt pathway gene (<i>ERBB2</i> [<i>HER2</i>]). Breast cancer treatments are complex with varying drug responses and efficacy among patients. This necessitates identifying novel biomarkers for predicting the drug response, using available data and new technologies. <i>GSR</i>, <i>NOX4</i>, <i>CASP3</i>, and <i>ERBB2</i> are potential biomarkers for predicting the treatment response in primary ER+ ductal breast carcinoma.	859	888	CANCER	infiltrating ductal carcinoma	infiltrating ductal carcinoma
Breast cancer arises as a result of multiple interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Conventionally, breast cancer is treated based on histopathological and clinical features. DNA technologies like the human genome microarray are now partially integrated into clinical practice and are used for developing new "personalized medicines" and "pharmacogenetics" for improving the efficiency and safety of cancer medications. We investigated the effects of four established therapies-for ER+ ductal breast cancer-on the differential gene expression. The therapies included single agent tamoxifen, two-agent docetaxel and capecitabine, or combined three-agents CAF (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil) and CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil).

Hypoglycemia is a common complication among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients receiving sulfonylurea therapy. The aim of this study was to determine if genetic contributions to sulfonylurea pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics substantially affect the risk of hypoglycemia in these patients. In a retrospective case-control study in European American patients with T2DM, we examined the potential association between CYP2C9 reduced-function variants and sulfonylurea-related hypoglycemia. We also explored the relationship between sulfonylurea-related hypoglycemia and several candidate genetic variants previously reported to alter the response to sulfonylureas. We detected no evidence of association between CYP2C9 reduced-function alleles or any of the candidate genetic variants and sulfonylurea-related hypoglycemia. In conclusion, we identified no clinically significant predictors of hypoglycemia among genes associated with sulfonylurea pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.	76	84	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Fluoxetine is one of the most prescribed antidepressants, yet it still faces challenges due to high intersubject variability in patient response. Mainly metabolized by the highly polymorphic gene <i>CYP2D6</i>, important differences in plasma concentrations after the same doses are found among individuals. This study investigated the association of fluoxetine pharmacokinetics (PK) with pharmacogenetic variants. A bioequivalence crossover trial (two sequences, two periods) was conducted with fluoxetine 20 mg capsules, in 24 healthy subjects. Blood samples for fluoxetine determination were collected up to 72 h post-dose. Subjects were genotyped and single nucleotide variants (SNV) were selected using a candidate gene approach, and then associated with the PK parameters. Bioequivalence was confirmed for the test formulation. We found 34 SNV on 10 genes with a quantifiable impact on the PK of fluoxetine in the randomized controlled trial. Out of those, 29 SNVs belong to 7 CYPs (<i>CYP1A2</i>, <i>CYP2B6</i>, <i>CYP2C9</i>, <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i>, <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>), and 5 SNVs to 3 genes impacting the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of fluoxetine (<i>SLC6A4</i>, <i>TPH1</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>). Moreover, decreased/no function SNVs of <i>CYP2D6</i> (rs1065852, rs28371703, rs1135840) and <i>CYP2C19</i> (rs12769205) were confirmed phenotypically. Our research contributes to deepening the catalog of genotype-phenotype associations in pharmacokinetics, aiming to increase pharmacogenomics knowledge for rational treatment schemes of antidepressants.	128	135	ORGANISM	patient	patient

Subjects were genotyped and single nucleotide variants (SNV) were selected using a candidate gene approach, and then associated with the PK parameters. Bioequivalence was confirmed for the test formulation. We found 34 SNV on 10 genes with a quantifiable impact on the PK of fluoxetine in the randomized controlled trial. Out of those, 29 SNVs belong to 7 CYPs (<i>CYP1A2</i>, <i>CYP2B6</i>, <i>CYP2C9</i>, <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i>, <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>), and 5 SNVs to 3 genes impacting the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of fluoxetine (<i>SLC6A4</i>, <i>TPH1</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>). Moreover, decreased/no function SNVs of <i>CYP2D6</i> (rs1065852, rs28371703, rs1135840) and <i>CYP2C19</i> (rs12769205) were confirmed phenotypically. Our research contributes to deepening the catalog of genotype-phenotype associations in pharmacokinetics, aiming to increase pharmacogenomics knowledge for rational treatment schemes of antidepressants.	764	766	GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT	PK	PK
Fluoxetine is one of the most prescribed antidepressants, yet it still faces challenges due to high intersubject variability in patient response. Mainly metabolized by the highly polymorphic gene <i>CYP2D6</i>, important differences in plasma concentrations after the same doses are found among individuals. This study investigated the association of fluoxetine pharmacokinetics (PK) with pharmacogenetic variants. A bioequivalence crossover trial (two sequences, two periods) was conducted with fluoxetine 20 mg capsules, in 24 healthy subjects. Blood samples for fluoxetine determination were collected up to 72 h post-dose.

Heart failure is a significant medical problem affecting more than five million people in the USA alone. Although clinical trials of pharmacological agents have demonstrated significant reductions in the relative risk of mortality across populations, absolute mortality remains high. In addition, individual variation in response is great. Some of this variation may be explained by genetic polymorphism. In this paper, we review the key studies to date in heart failure pharmacogenetics, setting this against a background of recent progress in the genetics of warfarin metabolism. Several polymorphisms that have supporting molecular and clinical data in the heart failure literature are reviewed, among them the beta1-adrenergic receptor variant Arg389Gly and the angiotensin converting enzyme gene insertion/deletion polymorphism. These variants and others are responsible for a fraction of the total variation seen in the treatment response to heart failure. With the dawn of the genomic age, further pharmacogenetic and new pharmacogenomic studies will advance our ability to tailor the treatment of heart failure.	0	5	ORGAN	Heart	Heart

The pharmacokinetic variability of nifedipine widely observed in the clinic cannot be fully explained by pharmacogenomics. As a new factor affecting drug metabolism, how the gut microbiota affects the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine needs to be explored. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) have been commonly used in hypertension-related research and served as the experimental groups; Wistar rats were used as control groups. In this study, the bioavailability of nifedipine decreased by 18.62% (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the SHRs compared with the Wistar rats. Changes in microbiota were associated with the difference in pharmacokinetics. The relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides dorei</i> was negatively correlated with AUC<sub>0-t</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.881, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.714, <i>p</i> = 0.047). Analysis of serum bile acid (BA) profiles indicated that glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were significantly increased in the SHRs. Compared with the Wistar rats, the expressions of CYP3A1 and PXR were upregulated and the enzyme activity of CYP3A1 increased in the SHRs. Spearman's rank correlation revealed that <i>Bacteroides stercoris</i> was negatively correlated with GUDCA (<i>r</i> = -0.7126, <i>p</i> = 0.0264) and GCDCA (<i>r</i> = -0.6878, <i>p</i> = 0.0339). Moreover, GUDCA was negatively correlated with <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.556, <i>p</i> = 0.025). In primary rat hepatocytes, GUDCA could induce the expressions of PXR target genes <i>CYP3A1</i> and <i>Mdr1a</i>. Furthermore, antibiotic treatments in SHRs verified the impact of microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Generally, gut microbiota affects the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine through microbial biotransformation or by regulating the enzyme activity of CYP3A1.	174	177	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	gut	gut

The relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides dorei</i> was negatively correlated with AUC<sub>0-t</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.881, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.714, <i>p</i> = 0.047). Analysis of serum bile acid (BA) profiles indicated that glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) were significantly increased in the SHRs. Compared with the Wistar rats, the expressions of CYP3A1 and PXR were upregulated and the enzyme activity of CYP3A1 increased in the SHRs. Spearman's rank correlation revealed that <i>Bacteroides stercoris</i> was negatively correlated with GUDCA (<i>r</i> = -0.7126, <i>p</i> = 0.0264) and GCDCA (<i>r</i> = -0.6878, <i>p</i> = 0.0339). Moreover, GUDCA was negatively correlated with <i>C</i><sub>max</sub> (<i>r</i> = -0.556, <i>p</i> = 0.025). In primary rat hepatocytes, GUDCA could induce the expressions of PXR target genes <i>CYP3A1</i> and <i>Mdr1a</i>. Furthermore, antibiotic treatments in SHRs verified the impact of microbiota on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Generally, gut microbiota affects the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine through microbial biotransformation or by regulating the enzyme activity of CYP3A1.	1704	1707	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	gut	gut
We systematically collected eligible data to measure the effect of CYP3A5*1 expression on personalized tacrolimus therapy. Six databases were searched for studies on adult liver transplant recipients and donors of liver graft which reported tacrolimus dose requirement, trough blood concentration, and/or concentration/dose (C/D) ratio in expressers and nonexpressers of CYP3A5*1. Eligible data were pooled by meta-analysis. Sixteen observational studies (1309 recipients, 1044 donors of liver graft) were included in the analyses. Tacrolimus C/D ratio was lower, and the dose was higher in recipient expressers of CYP3A5*1 and/or carriers of expresser liver graft at 1-4 weeks and 2-4, 6, and 12 months post-transplantation. Tacrolimus blood concentration was lower at the first two weeks. Pair expressers were affected by about twofold, and the effect was different between ethnic groups. CYP3A5*1 expression in recipients increased tacrolimus required dose by 0.023 at first, 0.022 at third, and 0.012 mg/kg/day at sixth month. Its expression in graft tissue increased tacrolimus required dose by 0.024 at first, 0.035 at third, and 0.032 mg/kg/day at sixth month. Considering CYP3A5*1 polymorphism can be helpful in individualization of tacrolimus efficient dose prior to administration, and it can remove initial high-risk lag time (over/underdose period before reaching target blood level) at first few days post-transplantation.	172	177	ORGAN	liver	liver

Although there are guidelines for treatment of short stature, open questions regarding optimal management of growth hormone therapy still exist. Experts attending six international meetings agree that successful therapy results in the patient attaining mid-parental height, and relies on correct diagnosis and early intervention. Experts advocate patient followup every 3-6 months, and that growth and adherence should be monitored at each visit. Growth response is variable, and an accepted definition of good/poor response is lacking. Combined with patient education and regular patient follow-up, a definition of treatment response could lead to improved treatment outcomes. Few experts use prediction models in clinical practice, but all agree that pharmacogenetics might improve prediction, enable early therapy modulation, and promote growth. Poor growth is often due to low adherence. Guidance on optimal management of growth hormone therapy is required, with focus on early diagnosis, dosing, treatment monitoring, adherence, and motivation.	235	242	ORGANISM	patient	patient

The majority of patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas have advanced disease at presentation, with only 20% surviving beyond one year. Even among the 10% to 15% of patients who present with localized disease, only 20% will be alive 5 years post surgical resection. Systemic therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma to date has failed to provide more than a very modest survival benefit for patients with advanced disease. However, the past decade has seen significant advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, culminating in the sequencing of the pancreatic cancer genome. New generations of therapeutic agents targeting key oncogenic cellular signaling pathways are currently under evaluation in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Although thus far only erlotinib has been shown to improve survival when compared to gemcitabine monotherapy, the authors anticipate that further developments in biomarker analysis and pharmacogenomics, along with the identification of new drugs will help maximize the benefit of novel therapeutics by directing effective use in the future. Herein the authors review the evidence to date for the use of novel cytotoxic and molecularly targeted agents in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and discuss key areas for future therapeutic development.	16	24	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active drug moiety of mycophenolate, is a potent immunosuppressant agent, which is increasingly being used in the treatment of patients with various autoimmune diseases. An understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate in this population should assist the clinician with rational dosage decisions. This review aims to provide an overview of the published literature on the clinical pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate in autoimmune disease and a briefer summary of current pharmacodynamic knowledge, and to identify areas of potential future research in this field. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE databases as well as bibliographies of relevant articles and 'on-line early' pages of key journals. Twenty-six pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies of mycophenolate in people with autoimmune disease were identified and appraised. Twenty-two of these studies used non-compartmental analysis techniques and four used population modelling methods to estimate mycophenolate pharmacokinetic parameters. Seven studies linked mycophenolate exposure to treatment outcomes. Only four studies measured free (unbound) as well as total mycophenolate exposure and only two studies characterised MPA disposition following enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) administration. Across all studies MPA displayed erratic and complex pharmacokinetics with substantial between-subject variability. Based on total drug measurement, the dose-normalised MPA area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 12 h post-dose (AUC12) varied at least five- to ten-fold between subjects. Typical values for apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of MPA during nonlinear mixed-effects modelling ranged from 8.3 to 25.3 L/h. Patient renal function, serum albumin levels, sex, ethnicity, food intake, concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as antacids, metal-containing medications and proton pump inhibitors and polymorphisms in genes encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase were identified in some studies as having a significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate. Typical MPA CL/F values in autoimmune disease patients were generally slightly lower than values published previously in population pharmacokinetic studies involving renal allograft recipients, possibly because of usage of ciclosporin, poorer renal function or lower serum albumin levels in the renal transplant cohort. In a single crossover study involving ten subjects only, significantly higher MPA AUC12 and maximum MPA concentration (C max) and lower MPA CL/F were reported following EC-MPS administration compared to mycophenolate mofetil administration. MPA exposure correlated well with treatment efficacy in patients with autoimmune disease (response to treatment, active disease and disease markers); however the relationship between MPA exposure and adverse events (infectious episodes, haematological toxicity and gastrointestinal symptoms) was unclear. Further investigation is required in autoimmune diseases such as chronic plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis and following EC-MPS administration. The extent of within-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate is largely unknown and potential covariate influences need to be confirmed in studies with large subject numbers. A relationship between MPA and MPA metabolite exposure and toxicity needs to be established. The contribution of pharmacogenetics to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate warrants further investigation, as does the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring. Dosing to achieve a target MPA AUC12 >35 mg·h/L is likely to lead to better efficacy outcomes in patients with autoimmune disease (rather than just giving standard doses, which lead to a wide range of exposures). However, the relationship between mycophenolate exposure and toxicity requires further investigation to determine the upper end of a target AUC range.	156	164	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Only four studies measured free (unbound) as well as total mycophenolate exposure and only two studies characterised MPA disposition following enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) administration. Across all studies MPA displayed erratic and complex pharmacokinetics with substantial between-subject variability. Based on total drug measurement, the dose-normalised MPA area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 12 h post-dose (AUC12) varied at least five- to ten-fold between subjects. Typical values for apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of MPA during nonlinear mixed-effects modelling ranged from 8.3 to 25.3 L/h. Patient renal function, serum albumin levels, sex, ethnicity, food intake, concurrent administration of interacting drugs such as antacids, metal-containing medications and proton pump inhibitors and polymorphisms in genes encoding uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase were identified in some studies as having a significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate. Typical MPA CL/F values in autoimmune disease patients were generally slightly lower than values published previously in population pharmacokinetic studies involving renal allograft recipients, possibly because of usage of ciclosporin, poorer renal function or lower serum albumin levels in the renal transplant cohort. In a single crossover study involving ten subjects only, significantly higher MPA AUC12 and maximum MPA concentration (C max) and lower MPA CL/F were reported following EC-MPS administration compared to mycophenolate mofetil administration. MPA exposure correlated well with treatment efficacy in patients with autoimmune disease (response to treatment, active disease and disease markers); however the relationship between MPA exposure and adverse events (infectious episodes, haematological toxicity and gastrointestinal symptoms) was unclear. Further investigation is required in autoimmune diseases such as chronic plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis and following EC-MPS administration. The extent of within-subject variability in the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate is largely unknown and potential covariate influences need to be confirmed in studies with large subject numbers. A relationship between MPA and MPA metabolite exposure and toxicity needs to be established. The contribution of pharmacogenetics to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate warrants further investigation, as does the utility of therapeutic drug monitoring. Dosing to achieve a target MPA AUC12 >35 mg·h/L is likely to lead to better efficacy outcomes in patients with autoimmune disease (rather than just giving standard doses, which lead to a wide range of exposures). However, the relationship between mycophenolate exposure and toxicity requires further investigation to determine the upper end of a target AUC range.	2442	2455	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum albumin	serum albumin
Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active drug moiety of mycophenolate, is a potent immunosuppressant agent, which is increasingly being used in the treatment of patients with various autoimmune diseases. An understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mycophenolate in this population should assist the clinician with rational dosage decisions. This review aims to provide an overview of the published literature on the clinical pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate in autoimmune disease and a briefer summary of current pharmacodynamic knowledge, and to identify areas of potential future research in this field. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE databases as well as bibliographies of relevant articles and 'on-line early' pages of key journals. Twenty-six pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies of mycophenolate in people with autoimmune disease were identified and appraised.

The cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme involved in the clearance of many drugs. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 contribute to the large inter-individual variability in drug metabolism and could affect metabolic phenotyping of CYP2D6 probe substances such as dextromethorphan (DXM). To study this question, we (i) established an extensive pharmacokinetics dataset for DXM; and (ii) developed and validated a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of DXM and its metabolites dextrorphan (DXO) and dextrorphan O-glucuronide (DXO-Glu) based on the data. Drug-gene interactions (DGI) were introduced by accounting for changes in CYP2D6 enzyme kinetics depending on activity score (AS), which in combination with AS for individual polymorphisms allowed us to model CYP2D6 gene variants. Variability in CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 activity was modeled based on <i>in vitro</i> data from human liver microsomes. Model predictions are in very good agreement with pharmacokinetics data for CYP2D6 polymorphisms, CYP2D6 activity as described by the AS system, and CYP2D6 metabolic phenotypes (UM, EM, IM, PM). The model was applied to investigate the genotype-phenotype association and the role of CYP2D6 polymorphisms for metabolic phenotyping using the urinary cumulative metabolic ratio (UCMR), DXM/(DXO + DXO-Glu). The effect of parameters on UCMR was studied <i>via</i> sensitivity analysis. Model predictions indicate very good robustness against the intervention protocol (i.e. application form, dosing amount, dissolution rate, and sampling time) and good robustness against physiological variation. The model is capable of estimating the UCMR dispersion within and across populations depending on activity scores. Moreover, the distribution of UCMR and the risk of genotype-phenotype mismatch could be estimated for populations with known CYP2D6 genotype frequencies. The model can be applied for individual prediction of UCMR and metabolic phenotype based on CYP2D6 genotype. Both, model and database are freely available for reuse.	916	938	ORGANISM	human liver microsomes	human liver microsomes

Pharmacogenetics offers a way to personalize medication prescribing for patients. Through the use of genetic tests that identify variations in enzymes important to drug metabolism, PAs can have patients' genetic information before prescribing a medication. This may reduce the risks of adverse reactions and lost treatment time when patients are given drugs to which they are unlikely to respond. Laboratory testing can identify common genetic variants that alter how the body metabolizes drugs. PAs with knowledge of these variants can choose medications that are more personalized and effective for each patient. Clinical pharmacogenetic guidelines are under development and will help providers identify which drugs are most likely to be affected by genetic variations so they can prescribe for patients based on their specific genetic phenotypes.	72	80	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies. The classical symptoms of FXIII deficiency span from intracranial haemorrhage to delay bleeding or the staying of chronic wounds in the skin including impaired mucosal healing. In this view, FXIII bridges primary haemostasis, coagulation and definite tissue healing. Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing.

Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies. The classical symptoms of FXIII deficiency span from intracranial haemorrhage to delay bleeding or the staying of chronic wounds in the skin including impaired mucosal healing. In this view, FXIII bridges primary haemostasis, coagulation and definite tissue healing. Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing. Accordingly, adequate FXIII levels can drive and predict the prognosis of complex diseases and the outcome of the associated therapies or interventions.

Another important recently discovered function ascribed to FXIII is its ability to limit bacterial spreading from the lesion by incorporating specific macromolecules addressed to cellular infiltration, favouring in turn cell migration and survival, as observed also in fibrin-heart cultures for stem cell recruitment. In the field of the novel prognostic biomarkers, the monitoring of the residual circulating FXIII level during acute myocardial infarction has been considered predictive of the post-myocardial infarction healing. Accordingly, adequate FXIII levels can drive and predict the prognosis of complex diseases and the outcome of the associated therapies or interventions. In addition, peculiar pharmacogenetics aspects of the FXIII gene are of extraordinary interest. The present review accounts for the recognized role of FXIII in the healing process and gives some examples on how to use it as prognostic biological/ molecular marker or as potential tailored therapeutic molecule in complex diseases.	1416	1420	CELL	cell	cell
Factor XIII (FXIII) is a key molecule in the field of blood coagulation and in the last decades it has weakened attention within the field of angiogenesis and tissue repair. FXIII positively influences wound healing in several tissues by exerting multiple plasma and cellular functions. In the field of haemostasis, FXIII cross-links the neo formed fibrin fibers and supports platelet adhesion to the damaged sub-endothelium warranting a solid architecture. In addition, the pro-angiogenic functions of FXIII are directed by the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the integrin αVβ3, on the cell membrane, favouring an important step in the formation of granulation tissue at the wound site for optimal tissue healing. Conversely, the same mechanisms could lead to undesired increased neovascularisation, for example in inflammatory bowel disease or in the retinal degenerative pathologies.

Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are very common variants of many genes and are also promising markers associated with drug reactions in pharmacogenomics research. In pediatric organ transplantation, tacrolimus is a major immunosuppressive agent used to prevent organ rejection. The SNP of these genes have been studied extensively in adult population, but there is no systematic review in children. This article focuses on the effects of ABCB1 and CYP3A SNPs on tacrolimus in children who are undergoing organ transplantations.	183	188	ORGAN	organ	organ

Mithramycin demonstrates preclinical anticancer activity, but its therapeutic dose is limited by the development of hepatotoxicity that remains poorly characterized. A pharmacogenomics characterization of mithramycin-induced transaminitis revealed that hepatotoxicity is associated with germline variants in genes involved in bile disposition: <i>ABCB4</i> (multidrug resistance 3) rs2302387 and <i>ABCB11</i> [bile salt export pump (BSEP)] rs4668115 reduce transporter expression (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and were associated with ≥grade 3 transaminitis developing 24 hours after the third infusion of mithramycin (25 mcg/kg, 6 hours/infusion, every day ×7, every 28 days; <i>P</i> < 0.0040). A similar relationship was observed in a pediatric cohort. We therefore undertook to characterize the mechanism of mithramycin-induced acute transaminitis. As mithramycin affects cellular response to bile acid treatment by altering the expression of multiple bile transporters (e.g., ABCB4, ABCB11, sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, organic solute transporter <i>α</i>/<i>β</i>) in several cell lines [Huh7, HepaRG, HepaRG BSEP (-/-)] and primary human hepatocytes, we hypothesized that mithramycin inhibited bile-mediated activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR was downregulated in all hepatocyte cell lines and primary human hepatocytes (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and mithramycin inhibited chenodeoxycholic acid- and GW4046-induced FXR-galactose-induced gene 4 luciferase reporter activity (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Mithramycin promoted glycochenodeoxycholic acid-induced cytotoxicity in <i>ABCB11</i> (-<i>/</i>-) cells and increased the overall intracellular concentration of bile acids in primary human hepatocytes grown in sandwich culture (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Mithramycin is a FXR expression and FXR transactivation inhibitor that inhibits bile flow and potentiates bile-induced cellular toxicity, particularly in cells with low ABCB11 function. These results suggest that mithramycin causes hepatotoxicity through derangement of bile acid disposition; results also suggest that pharmacogenomic markers may be useful to identify patients who may tolerate higher mithramycin doses. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The present study characterizes a novel mechanism of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in which mithramycin not only alters farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner gene expression but also inhibits bile acid binding to FXR, resulting in deregulation of cellular bile homeostasis. Two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms in bile flow transporters are associated with mithramycin-induced liver function test elevations, and the present results are the rationale for a genotype-directed clinical trial using mithramycin in patients with thoracic malignancies.	37	47	CANCER	anticancer	anticancer

A pharmacogenomics characterization of mithramycin-induced transaminitis revealed that hepatotoxicity is associated with germline variants in genes involved in bile disposition: <i>ABCB4</i> (multidrug resistance 3) rs2302387 and <i>ABCB11</i> [bile salt export pump (BSEP)] rs4668115 reduce transporter expression (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and were associated with ≥grade 3 transaminitis developing 24 hours after the third infusion of mithramycin (25 mcg/kg, 6 hours/infusion, every day ×7, every 28 days; <i>P</i> < 0.0040). A similar relationship was observed in a pediatric cohort. We therefore undertook to characterize the mechanism of mithramycin-induced acute transaminitis. As mithramycin affects cellular response to bile acid treatment by altering the expression of multiple bile transporters (e.g., ABCB4, ABCB11, sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, organic solute transporter <i>α</i>/<i>β</i>) in several cell lines [Huh7, HepaRG, HepaRG BSEP (-/-)] and primary human hepatocytes, we hypothesized that mithramycin inhibited bile-mediated activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR was downregulated in all hepatocyte cell lines and primary human hepatocytes (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and mithramycin inhibited chenodeoxycholic acid- and GW4046-induced FXR-galactose-induced gene 4 luciferase reporter activity (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Mithramycin promoted glycochenodeoxycholic acid-induced cytotoxicity in <i>ABCB11</i> (-<i>/</i>-) cells and increased the overall intracellular concentration of bile acids in primary human hepatocytes grown in sandwich culture (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Mithramycin is a FXR expression and FXR transactivation inhibitor that inhibits bile flow and potentiates bile-induced cellular toxicity, particularly in cells with low ABCB11 function. These results suggest that mithramycin causes hepatotoxicity through derangement of bile acid disposition; results also suggest that pharmacogenomic markers may be useful to identify patients who may tolerate higher mithramycin doses. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The present study characterizes a novel mechanism of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in which mithramycin not only alters farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner gene expression but also inhibits bile acid binding to FXR, resulting in deregulation of cellular bile homeostasis. Two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms in bile flow transporters are associated with mithramycin-induced liver function test elevations, and the present results are the rationale for a genotype-directed clinical trial using mithramycin in patients with thoracic malignancies.	1298	1319	CELL	hepatocyte cell lines	hepatocyte cell lines

Two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms in bile flow transporters are associated with mithramycin-induced liver function test elevations, and the present results are the rationale for a genotype-directed clinical trial using mithramycin in patients with thoracic malignancies.	2608	2613	ORGAN	liver	liver
Mithramycin demonstrates preclinical anticancer activity, but its therapeutic dose is limited by the development of hepatotoxicity that remains poorly characterized. A pharmacogenomics characterization of mithramycin-induced transaminitis revealed that hepatotoxicity is associated with germline variants in genes involved in bile disposition: <i>ABCB4</i> (multidrug resistance 3) rs2302387 and <i>ABCB11</i> [bile salt export pump (BSEP)] rs4668115 reduce transporter expression (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and were associated with ≥grade 3 transaminitis developing 24 hours after the third infusion of mithramycin (25 mcg/kg, 6 hours/infusion, every day ×7, every 28 days; <i>P</i> < 0.0040). A similar relationship was observed in a pediatric cohort. We therefore undertook to characterize the mechanism of mithramycin-induced acute transaminitis. As mithramycin affects cellular response to bile acid treatment by altering the expression of multiple bile transporters (e.g., ABCB4, ABCB11, sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, organic solute transporter <i>α</i>/<i>β</i>) in several cell lines [Huh7, HepaRG, HepaRG BSEP (-/-)] and primary human hepatocytes, we hypothesized that mithramycin inhibited bile-mediated activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR was downregulated in all hepatocyte cell lines and primary human hepatocytes (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and mithramycin inhibited chenodeoxycholic acid- and GW4046-induced FXR-galactose-induced gene 4 luciferase reporter activity (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Mithramycin promoted glycochenodeoxycholic acid-induced cytotoxicity in <i>ABCB11</i> (-<i>/</i>-) cells and increased the overall intracellular concentration of bile acids in primary human hepatocytes grown in sandwich culture (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Mithramycin is a FXR expression and FXR transactivation inhibitor that inhibits bile flow and potentiates bile-induced cellular toxicity, particularly in cells with low ABCB11 function. These results suggest that mithramycin causes hepatotoxicity through derangement of bile acid disposition; results also suggest that pharmacogenomic markers may be useful to identify patients who may tolerate higher mithramycin doses.

The clinical implementation of pharmacogenetic biomarkers continues to grow as new genetic variants associated with drug outcomes are discovered and validated. The number of drug labels that contain pharmacogenetic information also continues to expand. Published, peer-reviewed clinical practice guidelines have also been developed to support the implementation of pharmacogenetic tests. Incorporating pharmacogenetic information into health care benefits patients as well as clinicians by improving drug safety and reducing empiricism in drug selection. Barriers to the implementation of pharmacogenetic testing remain. This review explores current pharmacogenetic implementation initiatives with a focus on the challenges of pharmacogenetic implementation and potential opportunities to overcome these challenges.	456	464	ORGANISM	patients	patients
Although statins are effective in treating high cholesterol, adverse effects do occur with their use. Efficacy and tolerability vary among statins in different ethnic groups. Indigenous Australians have a high risk for cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Prescribing statins to Indigenous Australians with multi-morbidity requires different strategies to increase efficacy and reduce their toxicity. Previous studies have reported that Indigenous Australians are more susceptible to severe statin-induced myopathies. However, there is a lack of evidence in the underlying genetic factors in this population. This review aims to identify: inter-ethnic differences in the efficacy and safety of statins; major contributing factors accounting for any identified differences; and provide an overview of statin-induced adverse effects in Indigenous Australians.	219	233	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular	cardiovascular

In this study, we aimed to understand the gap in coverage of pharmacogenomic (PGx) biomarkers between Japan and the US. PGx biomarkers (1) in the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines; (2) that are CPIC level A or B; or (3) have US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug labels, were determined. Subsequently, their coverage by US health insurance companies and the National Health Insurance (NHI) in Japan was investigated. We identified the top six health insurance companies with the largest market shares in the US and investigated the coverage for the PGx biomarkers by these health insurers, Medicare, Medicaid, and the NHI in Japan. We found that 19.9% of these biomarkers are covered by the six companies (10.0%, the CPIC guidelines; 25.1%, the FDA-approved drug labels). The coverage of somatic and germline biomarkers was respectively 86.8% and 8.5% in the US and 56.3% and 0.6% in Japan. A few germline PGx biomarkers are covered both in Japan and the US, but the coverage of both somatic and germline biomarkers was lower in Japan. Therefore, more coverage should be considered to improve patient outcomes after prescribing medications in Japan.	246	247	CANCER	B	B

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affects patient outcomes and satisfaction. New research has centered on evaluation of post-discharge and opioid-related nausea and vomiting. Mechanical and drug effects stimulate the release of central nervous system neurotransmitters acting at receptors in the vomiting center, area postrema, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Brain surgery has allowed insight into specific central emetogenic areas. Stimuli from peripheral organs act through afferent vagus neurons and a parasympathetic response causing nausea and vomiting. Opioids stimulate mu receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and cholinergic receptors in the vestibular system. Opioids also affect gastrointestinal (GI) tract mechanics by decreasing gastric emptying, intestinal motility, GI peristalsis, and secretions. Regional blocks and non-opioid multimodal analgesia help to decrease nausea and vomiting. Patient, surgery, and anesthesia factors contribute to risk and degree of PONV experienced. Pharmacogenetics plays a role in gene typing as antiemetic medication metabolism results in varying drug effectiveness. Risk scoring systems are available. Individualized multimodal plans can be designed as part of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol.	49	56	ORGANISM	patient	patient

Vitamins are vital to sustain normal physiological function, metabolism, and growth for all living organisms. Being an integral component of coenzyme, vitamins can affect the catalytic activities of many enzymes and the expression of drug transporters. Genetic variations in metabolism and/or transporter genes of drugs can influence the exposure of the human body to drugs and/or their active metabolites, thus contributing to the variations in drug responses and toxicities. Nonetheless, pharmacogenomics studies on nutrients have been rarely summarized. In this article, we reviewed recent progress on vitamin pharmacogenomics, for a better understanding on the influence of vitamin-related gene polymorphisms on inter-individual differences in diseases and drug efficacy and safety.	354	364	ORGANISM	human body	human body
The peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are the key components of innate-immunity, and are highly specific for the recognition of bacterial peptidoglycans (PGN). Among different mammalian PGRPs, the PGRP1 binds to murein PGN of Gram-positive bacteria (lysine-type) and also have bactericidal activity towards Gram-negative bacteria (diaminopimelic acid or Dap-type). Buffaloes are the major sources of milk and meat in Asian sub-continents and are highly exposed to bacterial infections. The PGRP activates the innate-immune signaling, but their studies has been confined to limited species due to lack of structural and functional information. So, to understand the structural constituents, 3D model of buffalo PGRP1 (bfPGRP1) was constructed and conformational and dynamics properties of bfPGRP1 was studied. The bfPGRP1 model highly resembled human and camel PGRP structure, and shared a highly flexible N-terminus and centrally placed L-shaped cleft. Docking simulation of muramyl-tripeptide, tetrapeptide, pentapeptide-Dap-(MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap and MPP-Dap) and lysine-type (MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys) in AutoDock 4.2 and ArgusLab 4.0.1 anticipated β1, α2, α4, β4, and loops connecting β1-α2, α2-β2, β3-β4 and α4-α5 as the key interacting domains. The bfPGRP1-ligand complex molecular dynamics simulation followed by free binding energy (BE) computation conceded BE values of -18.30, -35.53, -41.80, -25.03, -24.62 and -22.30 kJ mol(-1) for MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap, MPP-Dap, MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys, respectively. The groove-surface and key binding residues involved in PGN-Dap and Lys-type interaction intended by the molecular docking, and were also accompanied by significant BE values directed their importance in pharmacogenomics, and warrants further in vivo studies for drug targeting and immune signaling pathways exploration.	409	413	TISSUE	milk	milk

The PGRP activates the innate-immune signaling, but their studies has been confined to limited species due to lack of structural and functional information. So, to understand the structural constituents, 3D model of buffalo PGRP1 (bfPGRP1) was constructed and conformational and dynamics properties of bfPGRP1 was studied. The bfPGRP1 model highly resembled human and camel PGRP structure, and shared a highly flexible N-terminus and centrally placed L-shaped cleft. Docking simulation of muramyl-tripeptide, tetrapeptide, pentapeptide-Dap-(MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap and MPP-Dap) and lysine-type (MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys) in AutoDock 4.2 and ArgusLab 4.0.1 anticipated β1, α2, α4, β4, and loops connecting β1-α2, α2-β2, β3-β4 and α4-α5 as the key interacting domains. The bfPGRP1-ligand complex molecular dynamics simulation followed by free binding energy (BE) computation conceded BE values of -18.30, -35.53, -41.80, -25.03, -24.62 and -22.30 kJ mol(-1) for MTP-Dap, MTrP-Dap, MPP-Dap, MTP-Lys, MTrP-Lys and MPP-Lys, respectively. The groove-surface and key binding residues involved in PGN-Dap and Lys-type interaction intended by the molecular docking, and were also accompanied by significant BE values directed their importance in pharmacogenomics, and warrants further in vivo studies for drug targeting and immune signaling pathways exploration.	726	733	CANCER	bfPGRP1	bfPGRP1

Landmark early work has led to the nearly universal use of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity with pregnancies complicated by impending preterm birth. Antenatal corticosteroids clearly reduce respiratory morbidity, death, and other adverse neonatal outcomes. Limited pregnant human pharmacokinetic data and some animal data give clinicians some information as to the behavior of the drug in the body. However, there is controversy about the type, amount, and frequency of steroid to use for this therapy. This review article summarizes the history, clinical use, and pharmacology of antenatal steroids. In addition, the review highlights some potential mediators of steroid response and current research strategies aimed at possible optimization of this therapy.	99	109	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	fetal lung	fetal lung

We aimed to refine the value of CDX2 as an independent prognostic and predictive biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC) according to disease stage and chemotherapy sensitivity in preclinical models. CDX2 expression was evaluated in 1045 stage I-IV primary CRCs by gene expression (n = 403) or immunohistochemistry (n = 642) and in relation to 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and chemotherapy. Pharmacogenomic associations between CDX2 expression and 69 chemotherapeutics were assessed by drug screening of 35 CRC cell lines. CDX2 expression was lost in 11.6% of cases and showed independent poor prognostic value in multivariable models. For individual stages, CDX2 was prognostic only in stage IV, independent of chemotherapy. Among stage I-III patients not treated in an adjuvant setting, CDX2 loss was associated with a particularly poor survival in the BRAF-mutated subgroup, but prognostic value was independent of microsatellite instability status and the consensus molecular subtypes. In stage III, the 5-year RFS rate was higher among patients with loss of CDX2 who received adjuvant chemotherapy than among patients who did not. The CDX2-negative cell lines were significantly more sensitive to chemotherapeutics than CDX2-positive cells, and the multidrug resistance genes MDR1 and CFTR were significantly downregulated both in CDX2-negative cells and in patient tumors. Loss of CDX2 in CRC is an adverse prognostic biomarker only in stage IV disease and appears to be associated with benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III. Early-stage patients not qualifying for chemotherapy might be reconsidered for such treatment if their tumor has loss of CDX2 and mutated BRAF.	94	111	CANCER	colorectal cancer	colorectal cancer

The CDX2-negative cell lines were significantly more sensitive to chemotherapeutics than CDX2-positive cells, and the multidrug resistance genes MDR1 and CFTR were significantly downregulated both in CDX2-negative cells and in patient tumors. Loss of CDX2 in CRC is an adverse prognostic biomarker only in stage IV disease and appears to be associated with benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III. Early-stage patients not qualifying for chemotherapy might be reconsidered for such treatment if their tumor has loss of CDX2 and mutated BRAF.	1167	1191	CELL	CDX2-negative cell lines	CDX2-negative cell lines
We aimed to refine the value of CDX2 as an independent prognostic and predictive biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC) according to disease stage and chemotherapy sensitivity in preclinical models. CDX2 expression was evaluated in 1045 stage I-IV primary CRCs by gene expression (n = 403) or immunohistochemistry (n = 642) and in relation to 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and chemotherapy. Pharmacogenomic associations between CDX2 expression and 69 chemotherapeutics were assessed by drug screening of 35 CRC cell lines. CDX2 expression was lost in 11.6% of cases and showed independent poor prognostic value in multivariable models. For individual stages, CDX2 was prognostic only in stage IV, independent of chemotherapy.

Genetic differences among individuals can explain some of the variability observed during drug treatment. Many studies have correlated the different pharmacological response to genetic variability, but most of them have been conducted on adult populations. Much less attention has been given to the pediatric population. Pediatric patients constitute a vulnerable group with regard to rational drug prescribing since they present differences arising from the various stages of development. However, only a few steps have been made in developmental pharmacogenomics. This review attempts to describe the current methods for pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic studies, providing some of the most studied examples in pediatric patients. It also gives an overview on the implication and importance of microRNA polymorphisms, transcriptomics, metabonomics, and proteomics in pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics studies.	331	339	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Differentiation blockade is a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A strategy to overcome such a blockade is a promising approach against the disease. The lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms hampers development of such strategies. Dysregulated ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is considered a druggable target in proliferative cancers susceptible to deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) depletion. Herein, we report an unanticipated discovery that hyperactivating RNR enables differentiation and decreases leukemia cell growth. We integrate pharmacogenomics and metabolomics analyses to identify that pharmacologically (eg, nelarabine) or genetically upregulating RNR subunit M2 (RRM2) creates a dNTP pool imbalance and overcomes differentiation arrest. Moreover, R-loop-mediated DNA replication stress signaling is responsible for RRM2 activation by nelarabine treatment. Further aggravating dNTP imbalance by depleting the dNTP hydrolase SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) enhances ablation of leukemia stem cells by RRM2 hyperactivation. Mechanistically, excessive activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling downstream of the imbalance contributes to cellular outcomes of RNR hyperactivation. A CRISPR screen identifies a synthetic lethal interaction between loss of DUSP6, an ERK-negative regulator, and nelarabine treatment. These data demonstrate that dNTP homeostasis governs leukemia maintenance, and a combination of DUSP inhibition and nelarabine represents a therapeutic strategy.	42	64	CANCER	acute myeloid leukemia	acute myeloid leukemia

PV is concerns with the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of ADRs. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics are an indispensable part of the clinical research. Variation in the human genome is a cause of variable response to drugs and susceptibility to diseases are determined, which is important for early drug discovery to PV. Moreover, PV has traditionally involved in mining spontaneous reports submitted to national surveillance systems. The research focus is shifting toward the use of data generated from platforms outside the conventional framework such as electronic medical records, biomedical literature, and patient-reported data in health forums. The emerging trend in PV is to link premarketing data with human safety information observed in the post-marketing phase. The PV system team obtains valuable additional information, building up the scientific data contained in the original report and making it more informative. This necessitates an utmost requirement for effective regulations of the drug approval process and conscious pre and post approval vigilance of the undesired effects, especially in India. Adverse events reported by PV system potentially benefit to the community due to their proximity to both population and public health practitioners, in terms of language and knowledge, enables easy contact with reporters by electronically.

Moreover, PV has traditionally involved in mining spontaneous reports submitted to national surveillance systems. The research focus is shifting toward the use of data generated from platforms outside the conventional framework such as electronic medical records, biomedical literature, and patient-reported data in health forums. The emerging trend in PV is to link premarketing data with human safety information observed in the post-marketing phase. The PV system team obtains valuable additional information, building up the scientific data contained in the original report and making it more informative. This necessitates an utmost requirement for effective regulations of the drug approval process and conscious pre and post approval vigilance of the undesired effects, especially in India. Adverse events reported by PV system potentially benefit to the community due to their proximity to both population and public health practitioners, in terms of language and knowledge, enables easy contact with reporters by electronically. Hence, PV helps to the patients get well and to manage optimally or ideally, avoid illness is a collective responsibility of industry, drug regulators, clinicians and other healthcare professionals to enhance their contribution to public health. This review summarized objectives and methodologies used in PV with critical overview of existing PV in India, challenges to overcome and future prospects with respect to Indian context.	1997	1999	CELL	PV	PV
Pharmacovigilance (PV) plays a key role in the healthcare system through assessment, monitoring and discovery of interactions amongst drugs and their effects in human. Pharmaceutical and biotechnological medicines are designed to cure, prevent or treat diseases; however, there are also risks particularly adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can cause serious harm to patients.

As part of substance use maintenance programs, individuals are monitored for sobriety through urine drug screens. A positive screen, and its confirmation and interpretation, can have devastating consequences, sometimes even leading to termination from the program and relapse. Naltrexone metabolism involves several steps and metabolites - one minor metabolite with very little mention in medical literature being noroxymorphone. This is also the final intermediate in the metabolic pathway of oxycodone; hence, detection is naturally presumed by clinicians to be attributed to oxycodone use. Through this case report, we alert clinicians that, depending on individual pharmacogenomics, it is possible to obtain a positive confirmation of this component alone (without any oxycodone pathway intermediates) with naltrexone administration.	94	99	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	urine	urine

The clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics (PGx) has often involved teams that include pharmacists. PGx laboratories often provide baseline information within the laboratory report that is based on Food and Drug Administration and Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium guidance, but information is often provided independent of concurrent disease states or medication use, among other clinical factors. Major challenges to widescale implementation of PGx include lack of physician experience or confidence in interpreting the data. The purpose of this paper is to describe how pharmacists can help further personalize PGx information and identify clinical recommendations for a given patient.	703	710	ORGANISM	patient	patient

Variable phenotypes of androgen insensitivity exist in humans, mainly owing to defective, mutated androgen receptors. A more subtle modulation of androgen effects is related to the CAG repeat polymorphism ([CAG]n) in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene, in vitro, transcription of androgen-dependent target genes is attenuated with increasing length of triplets. As a clinical entity, the CAG repeat polymorphism can relate to variations of androgenicity in (apparently) eugonadal men in various tissues and psychological traits, the longer the (CAG)n, the less prominent the androgen effect when individuals with similar testosterone concentrations are compared. A strictly defined threshold to hypogonadism is likely to be replaced by a continuum spanned by genetics as well as symptom specificity. In addition, effects of externally applied testosterone can be markedly influenced by the (CAG)n and respective pharmacogenetic implications are likely influence indications as well as modalities of testosterone treatment of hypogonadal men.	55	61	ORGANISM	humans	humans

This area of research is rapidly accelerating, aided by the use of novel and more economical molecular technologies. A substantial evidence base is being generated with the hopes that in the future it may be used to generate personalised treatment regimens in order to improve patient comfort and safety and reduce incidences of morbidity and mortality. Anaesthetics is an area of particular interest in this field, with previous research leading to better informed practice, specifically with regards to pseudocholinesterase deficiency and malignant hyperthermia. In this review, recent pharmacogenetic data pertaining to anaesthetic drugs will be presented and possible future applications and implications for practice will be discussed.	195	203	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Providing maximal therapeutic efficacy without toxicity is a universal goal of rational drug therapy. However, substantial between-patient variability in drug response often impedes such successful treatments and brings the necessity of tailoring drug dose to individual needs for more precise therapy. In many cases plenty of patient characteristics, such as body size, genetic makeup and environmental factors, need to be taken into consideration to find the optimal dose in clinical practice. A pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model-informed approach offers integration of various patient information to provide an expectation of drug response and derive practical dose estimates to support clinicians' dosing decisions. Such an approach was pioneered in the late 1970s, but its broad clinical acceptance and implementation have been hampered by the lack of widespread computer technology, including user-friendly software tools. This has significantly changed in recent years. With the advent of electronic health records (EHRs) and the ubiquity of user-friendly software tools, we now experience a convergence of clinical information, pharmacogenetics, systems pharmacology and pharmacometrics, and technology. Advanced pharmacometrics research is now more appliable and implementable to improve health care. This article presents examples of successful development and implementation of pharmacogenetics-guided and PK/PD model-informed decision support to facilitate precision dosing, including the development of an EHR-embedded decision support tool. Through the integration of clinical decision support tools in EHRs, clinical pharmacometrics support can be brought directly to the clinical team and the bedside.	327	334	ORGANISM	patient	patient

Sulphonyluea (SU) derivatives are insulin secretagogues and stimulate insulin secretion by inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Genes KCNJ11 and ABCC8 encode potassium channel proteins. KCNJ11 gene Glu23Lys polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of SU secondary failure, while Ser1369Ala polymorphism of ABCC8 gene had influence antidiabetic efficacy of SU drug gliclazide. In addition, the polymorphism of TCF7L2 gene, which has the strongest association with T2D, also influenced secondary SU drug failure. Insulin sensitisers include both metformin and glitazones. Some drug-genotype associations were observed for metformin in patients with T2D. Several genes influenced the effect of glitazone treatment. Rosiglitazone was more effective in diabetes control in carriers of Prol2Ala polymorphism of PPARG gene encoding the PPARg-receptor--the target of this drug. Rosiglitazone treatment had less effect on glycemic control and adiponectin increase in T2D patients with GG-genotypes of adiponectin (APM1) polymorphism. Pioglitazone treatment had smaller effect on glycemic control in patients with LPL Ser447X polymorphism. Identification of drug-genotype interactions in pharmacogenetic studies of the OAD treatment might have clinical implications in the near future resulting in selection of more specific "patient-tailored therapy" in T2D (Tab. 1, Ref. 58).	19	27	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Metformin is believed to reduce glucose levels primarily by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Recent data indicate that metformin antagonises glucagon-dependent glucose output, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms protect against hypoglycaemia. Here, we examined the effect of metformin on glucose metabolism in humans after a glycogen-depleting fast and the role of reduced-function alleles in OCT1 (also known as SLC22A1).	71	86	CANCER	hepatic glucose	hepatic glucose

Clinical trials of genotype-guided dosing of warfarin have yielded mixed results, which may in part reflect ethnic differences among study participants. However, no previous study has compared genotype-guided versus clinically guided or standard-of-care dosing in a Chinese population, whereas those involving African-Americans were underpowered to detect significant differences. We present a preclinical strategy that integrates pharmacogenetics (PG) and pharmacometrics to predict the outcome or guide the design of dosing strategies for drugs that show large interindividual variability. We use the example of warfarin and focus on two underrepresented groups in warfarin research.	310	327	ORGANISM	African-Americans	African-Americans
<b></b>Breast cancer is the fifth cause of cancer death among women worldwide and represents a global health concern due to the lack of effective therapeutic regimens that could be applied to all disease groups. Nowadays, strategies based on pharmacogenomics constitute novel approaches that minimize toxicity while maximizing drug efficacy; this being of high importance in the oncology setting. Besides, genetic profiling of malignant tumors can lead to the development of targeted therapies to be included in effective drug regimens. Advances in molecular diagnostics have revealed that breast cancer is a multifaceted disease, characterized by inter-tumoral and intra-tumoral heterogeneity and, unlike the past, molecular classifications based on the expression of individual biomarkers have led to devising novel therapeutic strategies that improve patient survival. In this review, we report and discuss the molecular classification of breast cancer subtypes, the heterogeneity resource, and the advantages and disadvantages of current drug regimens with consideration of pharmacogenomics in response and resistance to treatment.	7	20	CANCER	Breast cancer	Breast cancer

Clopidogrel resistance is an emerging clinical scenario, as antiplatelet therapy has become the cornerstone of modern cardiovascular treatment. This leads to an increase in stent thromboses and recurrent ischemic events which add to the health care costs, and increased periprocedural morbidity and mortality. Management of clopidogrel resistance is challenging as there are no standardized guidelines. The arrival of newer antiplatelet drugs and the detection of genetic polymorphisms in susceptible populations may have an impact on the management. Further trials are needed regarding the target population who should be screened for clopidogrel resistance, a standardized diagnostic test to detect clopidogrel resistance, the role of pharmacogenetics, and the need for tailored therapeutic options for a patient with clopidogrel resistance.	424	436	CANCER	antiplatelet	antiplatelet

Hypertension is a prevalent public health problem, contributing to >10 million deaths annually. Though multiple therapeutics exist, many patients suffer from treatment-resistant hypertension or try several medications before achieving blood pressure control. Genomic advances offer mechanistic understanding of blood pressure variability, therapeutic targets, therapeutic response, and promise a stratified approach to treatment of primary hypertension. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate augmentation, aldosterone synthase inhibitors, and angiotensinogen blockade with silencing RNA and antisense therapies are among the promising novel approaches. Pharmacogenomic studies have also been done to explore the genetic bases underpinning interindividual variability in response to existing therapeutics. A polygenic approach using risk scores is likely to be the next frontier in stratifying responses to existing therapeutics.	137	145	ORGANISM	patients	patients

Nephrotoxicity is a dose limiting side effect associated with the use of cisplatin in the treatment of solid tumors. The degree of nephrotoxicity is dictated by the selective accumulation of cisplatin in renal tubule cells due to: (1) uptake by organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and copper transporter 1 (CTR1); (2) metabolism by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and γ-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1); and (3) efflux by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1). The purpose of this study was to determine the significance of single nucleotide polymorphisms that regulate the expression and function of transporters and metabolism genes implicated in development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cisplatin treated patients. Changes in the kidney function were assessed using novel urinary protein biomarkers and traditional markers. Genotyping was conducted by the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System using a custom open array chip with metabolism, transport, and transcription factor polymorphisms of interest to cisplatin disposition and toxicity. Traditional and novel biomarker assays for kidney toxicity were assessed for differences according to genotype by ANOVA. Allele and genotype frequencies were determined based on Caucasian population frequencies. The polymorphisms rs596881 (<i>SLC22A2</i>/OCT2), and rs12686377 and rs7851395 (<i>SLC31A1</i>/CTR1) were associated with renoprotection and maintenance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Polymorphisms in <i>SLC22A2</i>/OCT2, <i>SLC31A1</i>/CTRI, <i>SLC47A1</i>/MATE1, <i>ABCC2</i>/MRP2, and <i>GSTP1</i> were significantly associated with increases in the urinary excretion of novel AKI biomarkers: KIM-1, TFF3, MCP1, NGAL, clusterin, cystatin C, and calbindin. Knowledge concerning which genotypes in drug transporters are associated with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity may help to identify at-risk patients and initiate strategies, such as using lower or fractionated cisplatin doses or avoiding cisplatin altogether, in order to prevent AKI.	103	115	CANCER	solid tumors	solid tumors

Anxiety disorders are chronic disorders appearing with a high frequency in the general population and causing much distress to those suffering from them. The current common treatment consists of antidepressants, primarily from the serotonin-selective-reuptake-inhibitor (SSRI) class. However, despite the relative effectiveness of these medications the patients' responses vary widely with one third not responding at all. While we do not currently have the ability to predict who will respond positively to the medication, it is hoped that genetic research will make it possible to prospectively identify responders and thus help avoid failed treatment attempts and side-effects. The field of pharmacogenetics is divided into pharmaco-kinetics (genetic factors that influence the drug metabolism in the body) and pharmco-dynamics (genetic factors that affect the response to the drug at the level of the receptors/transporters/enzymes in the target organs). Contrary to the treatment of depression, there is little research available on the pharmacogenetics of anxiety disorders and the existing research coincides with the studies on depression. The primary pharmacogenetic-dynamic findings are related to serotonergic genes of which those with the long allele of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) are expected to respond positively to treatment, and the same is true regarding genetic variants of several serotonin receptors. The pharmacogenetic-kinetic findings focus on the CYP450 enzyme system. The hope is that with the progression of the pharmacogenetic research new genetic variants will be discovered which, when combined with the clinical characteristics of those suffering from anxiety disorders, will enable the development of novel treatment algorithms to be customized for each patient.	353	361	ORGANISM	patients	patients

The field of pharmacogenetics is divided into pharmaco-kinetics (genetic factors that influence the drug metabolism in the body) and pharmco-dynamics (genetic factors that affect the response to the drug at the level of the receptors/transporters/enzymes in the target organs). Contrary to the treatment of depression, there is little research available on the pharmacogenetics of anxiety disorders and the existing research coincides with the studies on depression. The primary pharmacogenetic-dynamic findings are related to serotonergic genes of which those with the long allele of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) are expected to respond positively to treatment, and the same is true regarding genetic variants of several serotonin receptors. The pharmacogenetic-kinetic findings focus on the CYP450 enzyme system. The hope is that with the progression of the pharmacogenetic research new genetic variants will be discovered which, when combined with the clinical characteristics of those suffering from anxiety disorders, will enable the development of novel treatment algorithms to be customized for each patient.	1801	1808	ORGANISM	patient	patient
Antiretroviral therapy has markedly reduced morbidity and mortality for persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Individual tailoring of antiretroviral regimens has the potential to further improve the long-term management of HIV through the mitigation of treatment failure and drug-induced toxicities. While the mechanisms underlying anti-HIV drug adverse outcomes are multifactorial, the application of drug-specific pharmacogenomic knowledge is required in order to move toward the personalization of HIV therapy. Thus, detailed understanding of the metabolism and transport of antiretrovirals and the influence of genetics on these pathways is important. To this end, this review provides an up-to-date overview of the metabolism of anti-HIV therapeutics and the impact of genetic variation in drug metabolism and transport on the treatment of HIV. Future perspectives on and current challenges in pursuing personalized HIV treatment are also discussed.	72	79	ORGANISM	persons	persons

Failed medication trials are common in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD); however, the use of combinatorial pharmacogenomics to guide medication selection has been previously associated with improved outcomes in the psychiatric care setting. The utility of combinatorial pharmacogenomics in patients with MDD in primary care and psychiatric care settings was evaluated here. Patients enrolled in a naturalistic, open-label, prospective study [Individualized Medicine: Pharmacogenetics Assessment and Clinical Treatment (IMPACT)] with MDD were evaluated (N = 1871). Pharmacogenomic testing was performed for all patients and medications were categorized based on gene-drug interactions. Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) was evaluated at baseline and follow-up (weeks 8-12). Symptom improvement (percent decrease in BDI), response (≥50% decrease in BDI), and remission (BDI≤10) at follow-up were evaluated according to provider type and whether medications were genetically congruent (little/no gene-drug interactions). There was a 27.9% reduction in depression symptoms at follow-up, as well as response and remission rates of 25.7% and 15.2%, respectively. Outcomes were significantly better among patients treated by primary care providers versus psychiatrists (symptom improvement 31.7% versus 24.9%, p < 0.01; response rate 30.1% versus 22.3%, p < 0.01; remission rate 19.5% versus 12.0%, p < 0.01). There was a 31% relative improvement in response rate among patients taking congruent versus incongruent medications, with slightly higher congruence among primary care providers (87.6%) versus psychiatrists (85.2%). Following combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing, outcomes were significantly improved among patients treated by primary care providers compared to psychiatrists, which supports the use of pharmacogenomics in broader treatment settings.	306	314	ORGANISM	patients	patients

The allele frequency net database (http://www.allelefrequencies.net) is an online repository that contains information on the frequencies of immune genes and their corresponding alleles in different populations. The extensive variability observed in genes and alleles related to the immune system response and its significance in transplantation, disease association studies and diversity in populations led to the development of this electronic resource. At present, the system contains data from 1133 populations in 608,813 individuals on the frequency of genes from different polymorphic regions such as human leukocyte antigens, killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, major histocompatibility complex Class I chain-related genes and a number of cytokine gene polymorphisms. The project was designed to create a central source for the storage of frequency data and provide individuals with a set of bioinformatics tools to analyze the occurrence of these variants in worldwide populations. The resource has been used in a wide variety of contexts, including clinical applications (histocompatibility, immunology, epidemiology and pharmacogenetics) and population genetics. Demographic information, frequency data and searching tools can be freely accessed through the website.	347	354	CANCER	disease	disease

We describe a case series of 22 individuals who were referred to our laboratory by a pharmacist based in a mental health hospital, for pharmacogenetic analysis due to severe or unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to psychiatric medication. The participants were genotyped for common variation in the <i>CYP2D6</i>, <i>CYP2C19</i>, and <i>CYP2C9</i> genes, using Sanger sequencing. We tested variants in these genes as they have the strongest evidence with respect to altering the pharmacokinetics of commonly prescribed psychiatric medicine. Looking specifically at the subset of 18 European study participants, we observed a comparatively high but non-significant rate of pharmacogenetic variants, compared to allele frequency surveys in unselected population samples. For <i>CYP2D6</i>, we observed an elevated frequency of both poor (17%) and intermediate (33%) metabolizers when compared with previously reported frequencies (6% and 12% respectively). For <i>CYP2C19</i>, we observed an increased frequency of intermediate (33%) and ultra-rapid (17%) metabolizers compared to expected frequencies (21% and 4% respectively). For <i>CYP2C9</i>, the frequency of intermediate metabolizers (22%) was elevated compared to the expected population frequency (11%). While sample size is a major limitation of this brief report, we can conclude that patients with adverse reactions to antidepressant or antipsychotic drugs selected by a specialist mental health pharmacist appear to have a relatively high rate of genetic variants in pharmacogenes known to affect the pharmacokinetics of these drugs. The selective application of such pharmacogenetic tests by clinical pharmacists may be a valuable approach to clarify the basis for adverse or unusual responses to medication, and to guide ongoing prescribing decisions for this group of patients.	249	261	ORGANISM	participants	participants

This study explored the acceptability of a novel pharmacist-led pharmacogenetics (PGx) screening program among patients with cancer and healthcare professionals (HCPs) taking part in a multicenter clinical trial of PGx testing (PACIFIC-PGx ANZCTR:12621000251820). Medical oncologists, oncology pharmacists, and patients with cancer from across four sites (metropolitan/regional), took part in an observational, cross-sectional survey. Participants were recruited from the multicenter trial. Two study-specific surveys were developed to inform implementation strategies for scaled and sustainable translation into routine clinical care: one consisting of 21 questions targeting HCPs and one consisting of 17 questions targeting patients. Responses were collected from 24 HCPs and 288 patients. The 5-to-7-day PGx results turnaround time was acceptable to HCP (100%) and patients (69%). Most HCPs (92%) indicated that it was appropriate for the PGx clinical pharmacist to provide results to patients. Patients reported equal preference for receiving PGx results from a doctor/pharmacist. Patients and HCPs highly rated the pharmacist-led PGx service. HCPs were overall accepting of the program, with the majority (96%) willing to offer PGx testing to their patients beyond the trial. HCPs identified that lack of financial reimbursements (62%) and lack of infrastructure (38%) were the main reasons likely to prevent/slow the implementation of PGx screening program into routine clinical care. Survey data have shown overall acceptability from patients and HCPs participating in the PGx Program. Barriers to implementation of PGx testing in routine care have been identified, providing opportunity to develop targeted implementation strategies for scaled translation into routine practice.	125	131	CANCER	cancer	cancer

Pharmacogenetic testing of drug metabolizing enzyme polymorphisms provides an important tool to improve prescribing decisions, avoiding therapeutic failure and adverse drug reactions. Cytochrome P450 2D6 isoform plays an important role in the metabolism of about 20%-25% of widely used clinical drugs. Interethnic differences in allele frequency distribution of the CYP2D6 gene are well established, but interethnic admixture, introducing variations in population ancestry and resulting in distinct levels of population structure, should be acknowledged in pharmacogenomic studies to avoid inappropriate extrapolation of CYP2D6 data. The aim of the present research was to characterize CYP2D6 polymorphism in a random sample of 122 natives and 175 immigrants from Africa, Asia, and South America living in the Emilia-Romagna region (Italy), considering the present scenario of immigration and back migration events, which is a source of admixture. The results are today consistent with the known interethnic genetic variation, but the observed significant divergence between natives and Africans or South-East Asians predicts that admixture will reshape the population structure and the native metabolic ratio curve requiring, for drug prescription and pharmacogenetics studies, an interdisciplinary approach applied in an appropriate biogeographical and anthropological frame.	893	897	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	back	back
Personalized medicine is defined as individualized treatment based on the individual's genetic variants. Such treatment has the potential to enable pharmacogenetics, such as the prevention of 100,000 deaths per year in the USA because of adverse drug reactions or specify treatment in heart failure such at the beta 1 adrenergic receptor polymorphisms. It is claimed that coronary artery disease (CAD) is at least 50% because of genetic predisposition. Identification of the genes predisposing to CAD would greatly facilitate prevention, early treatment, and more specific therapies. The arrival of the multimillion single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array provides the high throughput genotyping required to perform genome-wide Association (GWA) studies. These studies require markers (SNPs) at intervals of 6,000 bp and sample size of several thousands. Platforms are available to genotype and process millions of genotypes per day. The GWA performed by the Ottawa Heart Genomic Study identified the first deoxyribonucleic acid region (9p21) predisposing to CAD after replication in six independent populations totaling 23,000. This was subsequently confirmed in several independent studies totally more than 45,000 individuals. The region confers a risk for CAD independent of known risk factors. 9p21 occurs in heterozygous form in 40 to 50% of Caucasians with increased risk of 15 to 20% and in homozygous form in 25% of Caucasians with increased risk of 40%. Identification of the genes predisposing to CAD is a prerequisite for personalized care of these patients. It is anticipated that most of the genes predisposing to CAD will be identified in the next 5 to 8 years. The 9p21, in addition to conferring increased risk, provides the bonus of being independent of known risk factors. Thus, 9p21 is likely to provide the impetus and nidus for a major research effort over the next few years. It has the potential to not only provide for early genetic screening but also as a target for novel therapy.	285	290	ORGAN	heart	heart

Azathioprine (AZA) is an effective immunosuppressant commonly used for malignancy and immune-mediated disorders. The association between genetic polymorphisms and AZA-induced adverse effects has not been elucidated. Hence this study aimed to evaluate the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms of ITPA (C94A) with azathioprine-induced adverse effects.	71	81	CANCER	malignancy	malignancy
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic continues to spread globally. The rapid dispersion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 drives an urgent need for effective treatments, especially for patients who develop severe pneumonia. The excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has proved to be an essential factor in the rapidity of disease progression, and some cytokines are significantly associated with adverse outcomes. Most of the upregulated cytokines signal through the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Therefore, blocking the exaggerated release of cytokines, including IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFNα/β/γ, by inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling will, presumably, offer favorable pharmacodynamics and present an attractive prospect. JAK inhibitors (JAKi) can also inhibit members of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family, including AP2-associated kinase 1 (AAK1) and cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), which regulate the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) transmembrane protein and are involved in host viral endocytosis. According to the data released from current clinical trials, JAKi treatment can effectively control the dysregulated cytokine storm and improve clinical outcomes regarding mortality, ICU admission, and discharge. There are still some concerns surrounding thromboembolic events, opportunistic infection such as herpes zoster virus reactivation, and repression of the host's type-I IFN-dependent immune repair for both viral and bacterial infection. However, the current JAKi clinical trials of COVID-19 raised no new safety concerns except a slightly increased risk of herpes virus infection. In the updated WHO guideline, Baricitinb is strongly recommended as an alternative to IL-6 receptor blockers, particularly in combination with corticosteroids, in patients with severe or critical COVID-19. Future studies will explore the application of JAKi to COVID-19 treatment in greater detail, such as the optimal timing and course of JAKi treatment, individualized medication strategies based on pharmacogenomics, and the effect of combined medications.	412	419	CANCER	disease	disease
Introduction: Alcohol dependence is one of the most important psychiatric disorders leading to enormous harm in individuals and indeed within society. Yet, although alcohol dependence is a disease of significant importance, the availability of efficacious pharmacological treatment is still limited. Areas covered: The current review focuses on neurobiological pathways that are the rationale for recent preclinical and clinical studies testing novel compounds that could be used as treatments for alcohol dependence. These neurobiological mechanisms include the: glutamatergic, dopaminergic and GABA mediated pathways as well as neuroendocrine systems. There is also an interest in the approaches for influencing chromatin structure. Expert opinion: There are several compounds in Phase I and Phase II clinical studies that have produced potentially useful results for the treating alcoholism. Further evaluation is still necessary, and the implementation of Phase III studies will help to elucidate the usefulness of these compounds. It is important that personalized approaches (e.g., pharmacogenomics) are investigated in these later studies, as the efficacy of different compounds may vary substantially between subgroups of patients.	564	577	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	glutamatergic	glutamatergic

Predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory (P4) medicine is an emerging medical model that is based on the customization of all medical aspects (i.e. practices, drugs, decisions) of the individual patient. P4 medicine presupposes the elucidation of the so-called omic world, under the assumption that this knowledge may explain differences of patients with respect to disease prevention, diagnosis and therapies. Here, we elucidate the role of some selected omics sciences for different aspects of disease management, such as early diagnosis of diseases, prevention of diseases, selection of personalized appropriate and optimal therapies based on molecular profiling of patients. After introducing basic concepts of P4 medicine and omics sciences, we review some computational tools and approaches for analysing selected omics data, with a special focus on microarray and mass spectrometry data, which may be used to support P4 medicine. Some applications of biomarker discovery and pharmacogenomics and some experiences on the study of drug reactions are also described.	510	517	CANCER	disease	disease
The advent of anti-TNF agents as the first approved targeted therapy in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients has made a major impact on our existing therapeutic algorithms. They have not only been approved for induction and maintenance treatment in IBD patients, but have also enabled us to define and achieve novel therapeutic outcomes, such as combination of clinical symptom control and endoscopic remission, as well as mucosal healing. Nevertheless, approximately one third of treated patients do not respond to initiated anti-TNF therapy and these treatments are associated with sometimes severe systemic side-effects. There is therefore the currently unmet clinical need do establish predictive markers of response to identify the subgroup of IBD patients, that have a heightened probability of response. There have so far been approaches from different fields of IBD research, to descry markers that would empower us to apply TNF-inhibitors in a more rational manner. These markers encompass findings from disease-related and clinical factors, pharmacokinetics, biochemical markers, blood and stool derived parameters, pharmacogenomics, microbial species, metabolic compounds, and mucosal factors. Furthermore, changes in the intestinal immune cell composition in response to therapeutic pressure of anti-TNF treatment have recently been implicated in the process of molecular resistance to these drugs. Insights into factors that determine resistance to anti-TNF therapy give reasonable hope, that a more targeted approach can then be utilized in these non-responders. Here, IL-23 could be identified as one of the key factors determining resistance to TNF-inhibitors. Growing insights into the molecular mechanism of action of TNF-inhibitors might also enable us to derive critical molecular markers that not only mediate the clinical effects of anti-TNF therapy, but which level of expression might also correlate with its therapeutic efficacy. In this narrative review, we present an overview of currently identified possible predictive markers for successful anti-TNF therapy and discuss identified molecular pathways that drive resistance to these substances. We will also point out the necessity and difficulty of developing and validating a diagnostic marker concerning clinically relevant outcome parameters, before they can finally enter daily clinical practice and enable a more personalized therapeutic approach.	102	107	ORGAN	bowel	bowel

The US FDA now recognizes the need to individualize treatment paradigms using biomarkers that predict response to therapy. In clinical practice the best example of this is TPMT testing, which is used to rationalize the starting dose of azathioprine and mercaptopurine. The more recent addition of drug metabolite monitoring means that thiopurine therapy can now be personalized to unprecedented levels. Of interest, parallels exist between TPMT deficiency as an explanation for thiopurine toxicity and DPD deficiency in fluoropyrimidine toxicity. For these drugs, variations in a single locus predict severe toxicity. However, while TPMT testing has translated into routine clinical practice, DPD testing has not. This article summarizes the recent research investigating interindividual differences in the metabolism of thiopurine and fluoropyrimidine drugs, and explores the attitudes which influence the uptake of pharmacogenetic testing.	335	345	AMINO_ACID	thiopurine	thiopurine

Numerous investigations on metabolic enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP) have been conducted since 1990. In the psychiatric field, CYP2D6, which is a major enzyme involved in the metabolism of antidepressants and antipsychotics, has been focused on. Poor metabolizers (deficit metabolizers) for CYP2D6 are 7% in Caucasians, while they are less than 1% in Asians. Frequency of a mutated allele for CYP2D6*10, which leads to a decrease in CYP2D6 activity, is 40% in Asians. It has been reported that the steady-state plasma concentration of haloperidol in subjects with mutated alleles for CYP2D6 is significantly higher than that in subjects without mutated alleles. On the other hand, the steady-state plasma concentration of risperidone is very different between CYP2D6 genotypes. Recently receptor polymorphism has been studied and an association between clinical response and polymorphism of dopamine and serotonin has been reported. In the dopamine D2, subjects with -141C Ins allele in -141C Ins/Del polymorphism and subjects with A1 allele in Taq 1A have better response to dopamine antagonists. Clinical pharmacogenetical studies from both a phamacokinetical and a pharmacogynamical point of view are required in order to introduce and practice individualized medicine in the psychiatric field easily.	307	317	CANCER	Caucasians	Caucasians

Cancer drug screening in patient-derived cells holds great promise for personalized oncology and drug discovery but lacks standardization. Whether cells are cultured as conventional monolayer or advanced, matrix-dependent organoid cultures influences drug effects and thereby drug selection and clinical success. To precisely compare drug profiles in differently cultured primary cells, we developed <i>DeathPro</i>, an automated microscopy-based assay to resolve drug-induced cell death and proliferation inhibition. Using <i>DeathPro</i>, we screened cells from ovarian cancer patients in monolayer or organoid culture with clinically relevant drugs. Drug-induced growth arrest and efficacy of cytostatic drugs differed between the two culture systems. Interestingly, drug effects in organoids were more diverse and had lower therapeutic potential. Genomic analysis revealed novel links between drug sensitivity and DNA repair deficiency in organoids that were undetectable in monolayers. Thus, our results highlight the dependency of cytostatic drugs and pharmacogenomic associations on culture systems, and guide culture selection for drug tests.	0	6	CANCER	Cancer	Cancer

Sequencing the human genome brings new tools for the individualisation of cancer chemotherapy, especially thanks to the identification of polymorphisms of genes involved in anticancer drug metabolism or activity (pharmacogenetics). A few functional polymorphisms have been known for a long time (thiopurine methyltransferase, glutathion S-transferases), but several new ones have been identified recently, at the level of the genes encoding drug targets (thymidylate synthase), at the level of DNA repair enzymes (XPD) or at the level of transport proteins (MDR1). Clinical trials, first on a retrospective basis, then on a prospective one, are implemented to validate this approach.	74	80	CANCER	cancer	cancer

In spite of the fact that the aging organism is the result of complex life-long gene/environment interactions, making peculiar the susceptibility to diseases and the response to drugs, pharmacogenetics studies are largely neglected in the aged. Altered response to drugs, cardiovascular and metabolic alterations, cancer and dementia are among the age associated ailments. The latter two are the major contributors to illness burden for the aged. Aging, dementia and cancer share a critical set of altered cellular functions in the response to DNA damage, genotoxic stress, and other insults. Aging in higher animals may be influenced by the balance of cell survival versus death, a decision often governed by checkpoint proteins in dividing cells. The paper is mainly focused on one of such proteins, p53 which has been recently shown to be involved in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Within this reference frame we studied p53 in aged controls and demented patients finding that with aging there is an increase of mutant like conformation state of p53 in peripheral blood cells, which is more pronounced in AD patients. As a result of such conformational change, p53 partially loses its activity and may become unable to properly activate an apoptotic program when cells are exposed to a noxious stimulus. Moreover we found that the tertiary structure of p53 and the sensitivity to p53-dependent apoptosis are affected by low concentrations of soluble beta amyloid, the peptide that accumulates in AD brain but also present in peripheral tissues. It is possible that p53 conformers may occur in the presence of misfolded molecules such as, but not limited to, beta amyloid. In particular at neuronal level the altered function of cell cycle proteins may affect synaptic plasticity rather than cell duplication.	314	320	CANCER	cancer	cancer

The paper is mainly focused on one of such proteins, p53 which has been recently shown to be involved in aging and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Within this reference frame we studied p53 in aged controls and demented patients finding that with aging there is an increase of mutant like conformation state of p53 in peripheral blood cells, which is more pronounced in AD patients. As a result of such conformational change, p53 partially loses its activity and may become unable to properly activate an apoptotic program when cells are exposed to a noxious stimulus. Moreover we found that the tertiary structure of p53 and the sensitivity to p53-dependent apoptosis are affected by low concentrations of soluble beta amyloid, the peptide that accumulates in AD brain but also present in peripheral tissues. It is possible that p53 conformers may occur in the presence of misfolded molecules such as, but not limited to, beta amyloid. In particular at neuronal level the altered function of cell cycle proteins may affect synaptic plasticity rather than cell duplication.	1697	1705	CELL	neuronal	neuronal
In spite of the fact that the aging organism is the result of complex life-long gene/environment interactions, making peculiar the susceptibility to diseases and the response to drugs, pharmacogenetics studies are largely neglected in the aged. Altered response to drugs, cardiovascular and metabolic alterations, cancer and dementia are among the age associated ailments. The latter two are the major contributors to illness burden for the aged.

The present study aims at evaluating the association between seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five genes involved on antiretroviral pharmacokinetic pathways and virological failure in first line highly active antiretroviral therapy. Seven candidate polymorphisms (rs3842 and rs1045642 in ABCB1, rs212091 and rs3743527 in ABCC1, rs3745274 in CYP2B6, rs628031 in SLC22A1 and rs1517618 in SLCO3A1) were evaluated if they were associated with virological failure through logistic regression analysis. The study design was a retrospective cohort, analyzing 187 patients from Recife metropolitan region (Pernambuco, Brazil): among these 160 obtained complete suppression of HIV-1 replication (responders) and were compared to 27 non-responders, which underwent virological failure. There was no association between CYP2B6, SLC22A1, and SLCO3A1 SNPs and virological failure. Using logistic regression analysis, a significant association was detected between rs1045642 (3435C>T, ABCB1) and rs212091 (198217T>C; 3'-UTR, ABCC1) with virological failure of first-line antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors, when controlled by clinical factors, such as sex, age and race. The present results could contribute to unravel the influence of genetic background in anti-HIV-1 therapy outcome and help in treatment personalization of Northeast Brazil HIV infected patients.	205	209	CELL	line	line
Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used and considered a first-line disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Many of the relevant genes have been investigated to estimate the association between gene polymorphisms and MTX effectiveness in RA patients, although inconsistent results have been reported. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to identify genetic variants associated with MTX efficacy. A total of 30 publications that included 34 genes and 125 SNPs associated with the transporters, enzymes, and metabolites of MTX or the progression of RA were included in the systematic review (SR), and 21 studies were included in 9 meta-analyses. Associations between MTX response in RA patients in MTHFR 1298A > C (rs1801131), ATIC 347C > G (rs2372536), RFC-1 80G > A (rs1051266), SLC19A1 A > G (rs2838956) and SLC19A1 G > A (rs7499) genetic polymorphisms were found, but not observed between the MTHFR 677C > T (rs1801133), TYMS 28 bp VNTR (rs34743033), MTRR 66A > G (rs1801394), and ABCB1 3435C > T (rs1045642). However, for the polymorphisms not being associated following meta-analysis could still be associated if larger cohorts were used, and studies of other polymorphisms are necessary in large cohorts and a rigorous way, which may provide more accurate results for the effect of the gene polymorphisms on the MTX response.	151	153	CANCER	RA	RA

The focus of treating an individual patient is the identification of the individual's specific needs. The measurement of the patient's characteristics, such as blood pressure or body temperature, and also the measurement of biomarkers, such as cholesterol or hemoglobin A1C is part of the patient's health assessment. The deeper the insights into the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of the patient, the better we are positioned to treat a patient. Increasingly, this assessment includes testing for certain pharmacologically relevant genetic variations (pharmacogenetics). Evaluating how the patient's genetic makeup combined with the patient's exposure to environmental influences could impact disease and treatment decisions is becoming the cornerstone of personalized medicine. However, we often use such assessments for finding the most 'effective' treatment, but we might not always be as rigorous in our assessment of potential safety risks. This is particularly apparent when looking at how safety risks are communicated. Often this information is only available as general, population-based statements and a small amount of information is available to evaluate whether or not an individual patient is at risk. Although pharmacogenetic tests that can help to assess whether an individual patient's personal risk exist (safety pharmacogenetics), they are not always performed.	160	165	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood	blood

Next-generation sequencing technology has afforded the discovery of many novel variants that are of significance to inheritable pharmacogenomics (PGx) traits but a large proportion of them have unknown consequences. These include missense variants resulting in single amino acid substitutions in cytochrome P450 (CYP) proteins that can impair enzyme function, leading to altered drug efficacy and toxicity. While most unknown variants are rare, an overlooked minority are variants that are collectively rare but enriched in specific populations. Here, we analyzed sequence variation data in 141,456 individuals from across eight study populations in gnomAD for 38 CYP genes to identify such variants in addition to common variants. By further comparison with data from two PGx-specific databases (PharmVar and PharmGKB) and ClinVar, we identified 234 missense variants in 35 CYP genes, of which 107 were unknown to these databases. Most unknown variants (n = 83) were population-specific common variants and several (n = 7) were found in important CYP pharmacogenes (CYP2D6, CYP4F2, and CYP2C19). Overall, 29% (n = 31) of 107 unknown variants were predicted to affect CYP enzyme function although further biochemical characterization is necessary. These variants may elucidate part of the unexplained interpopulation differences observed in drug response.	268	278	AMINO_ACID	amino acid	amino acid

Pharmacological treatment of colorectal cancer has improved survival rates in recent years. Individual genetic variation in genes associated with metabolism and targets of commonly used drugs can be responsible for variability in treatment outcome and toxicity. Diverse study designs have been used and heterogeneous end points evaluated by studies assessing the association of genetic markers with treatment outcome. We conducted this systematic review, including 51 studies, to present a comprehensive overview and draw further conclusions. To facilitate comparison of reported study results, risk estimates for observed genetic variants in 33 key genes are presented using defined reference categories and recalculated risk estimates based on data provided in original publications, where necessary. Overall, evidence indicates associations of the UGT1A1(*) 28 variant genotype with toxicity after irinotecan treatment, mutations in GSTP1-105 with improved treatment outcome and the XPD-751 variant genotype with poor treatment outcome after oxaliplatin treatment, and amplification of the EGFR gene with improved treatment outcome after therapy with monoclonal antibodies. Adequately powered prospective investigations designed specifically for pharmacogenetics are needed.	29	46	CANCER	colorectal cancer	colorectal cancer

Reported prevalence rates of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are between 8% to 20% in the US general population with an average medical expenditure of US$1.35 billion direct and US$205 million indirect costs. Current pathophysiologic theories are based on abnormalities of both the brain and gut, thus setting a new stage for current and future therapeutic approaches. There are numerous treatment options in IBS acting centrally and peripherally by influencing motility and visceral sensitivity. Clinical evidence is variable; however, newer emerging treatments are being evaluated using better-designed clinical trials. Accurate assessment of IBS drug efficacy is still hampered by heterogeneity of the IBS population. Novel methods such as pharmacogenomics or brain imaging may be helpful in the future to better understand and characterize IBS patient subtypes, and this in turn will lead to more specific and efficient therapeutic options. Patient subpopulation measurement of side effects is also a clinical challenge and further understanding could improve treatment efficacy enhancing the patient compliance.	39	44	ORGAN	bowel	bowel

Pain is still one of the most prevalent and distressing symptom in patients with chronic pain. Opioids are the most potent existing analgesics available in clinical practice. However, they are not always effective, particularly in the non-cancer population. Alternately adverse effects may limit their analgesic activity. Several different drug-development strategies have attempted to reduce side effects by exploiting anatomic barriers to drug distribution and to provide different analgesic mechanisms, as in the case of the oxycodone-naloxone combination or tapentadol. New delivery systems have been developed for a more effective management of breakthrough pain. Pharmacogenetics could play a critical role in personalizing pain management in the future.	235	245	CANCER	non-cancer	non-cancer
DNA biosensors are attractive tools for genetic analysis as there is an increasing need for rapid and low-cost DNA analysis, primarily driven by applications in personalized pharmacogenomics, clinical diagnostics, rapid pathogen detection, food traceability and forensics. A rapid electrochemical genosensor detection methodology exploiting a combination of modified primers for solution-phase isothermal amplification, followed by rapid detection via hybridization on gold electrodes is reported. Modified reverse primers, exploiting a C18 spacer between the primer-binding site and an engineered single stranded tail, are used in a recombinase polymerase amplification reaction to produce an amplicon with a central duplex flanked by two single stranded tails. These tails are designed to be complementary to a gold electrode tethered capture oligo probe as well as a horseradish peroxidase labelled reporter oligo probe. The time required for hybridization of the isothermally generated amplicons with each of the immobilized and reporter probes was optimised to be 2 min, in both cases. The effect of amplification time and the limit of detection were evaluated using these hybridization times for both single stranded and double stranded DNA templates. The best detection limit of 70 fM for a ssDNA template was achieved using 45 min amplification, whilst for a dsDNA template, just 30 min amplification resulted in a slightly lower detection limit of 14 fM, whilst both 20 and 45 min amplification times were observed to provide detection limits of 71 and 72 fM, respectively, but 30 and 45 min amplification resulted in a much higher signal and sensitivity. The genosensor was applied to genomic DNA and real patient and control blood samples for detection of the coeliac disease associated DQB1*02 HLA allele, as a model system, demonstrating the possibility to carry out molecular diagnostics, combining amplification and detection in a rapid and facile manner.	0	3	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant head and neck cancer type with high morbidity in Southeast Asia, however the pathogenic mechanism of this disease is poorly understood. Using integrative pharmacogenomics, we find that NPC subtypes maintain distinct molecular features, drug responsiveness, and graded radiation sensitivity. The epithelial carcinoma (EC) subtype is characterized by activations of microtubule polymerization and defective mitotic spindle checkpoint related genes, whereas sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC) and mixed sarcomatoid-epithelial carcinoma (MSEC) subtypes exhibit enriched epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion promoting genes, which are well correlated with their morphological features. Furthermore, patient-derived organoid (PDO)-based drug test identifies potential subtype-specific treatment regimens, in that SC and MSEC subtypes are sensitive to microtubule inhibitors, whereas EC subtype is more responsive to EGFR inhibitors, which is synergistically enhanced by combining with radiotherapy. Through combinational chemoradiotherapy (CRT) screening, effective CRT regimens are also suggested for patients showing less sensitivity to radiation. Altogether, our study provides an example of applying integrative pharmacogenomics to establish a personalized precision oncology for NPC subtype-guided therapies.	0	24	CANCER	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma

<i>Background and</i> <i>Objectives</i>: Codeine requires biotransformation by the <i>CYP2D6</i> enzyme, encoded by the polymorphic <i>CYP2D6</i> gene, to morphine for therapeutic efficacy. CYP2D6 phenotypes of poor, intermediate, and ultra-rapid metabolisers are at risk of codeine non-response and adverse drug reactions due to altered CYP2D6 function. The aim of this study was to determine whether genotype, inferred phenotype, and urinary and oral fluid codeine O-demethylation metabolites could predict codeine non-response following a short course of codeine. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: There were 131 Caucasians with persistent pain enrolled. Baseline assessments were recorded, prohibited medications ceased, and DNA sampling completed before commencing codeine 30 mg QDS for 5 days. Day 4 urine samples were collected 1-2 h post morning dose for codeine O-demethylation metabolites analysis. Final pain assessments were conducted on day 5. <i>Results</i>: None of the poor, intermediate, ultra-rapid metabolisers and only 24.5% of normal metabolisers responded to codeine. A simple scoring system to predict analgesic response from day 4 urinary metabolites was devised with overall prediction success of 79% (sensitivity 0.8, specificity 0.78) for morphine and 79% (sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.83) for morphine:creatinine ratio. <i>Conclusions</i>: In conclusion, this study provides tentative evidence that day 4 urinary codeine O-demethylation metabolites could predict non-response following a short course of codeine and could be utilised in the clinical assessment of codeine response at the point of care to improve analgesic efficacy and safety in codeine therapy. We offer a scoring system to predict codeine response from urinary morphine and urinary morphine:creatinine ratio collected on the morning of day 4 of codeine 30 mg QDS, but this requires validation before it could be considered for use to assess codeine response in clinical practice.	448	458	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral fluid	oral fluid

A simple scoring system to predict analgesic response from day 4 urinary metabolites was devised with overall prediction success of 79% (sensitivity 0.8, specificity 0.78) for morphine and 79% (sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.83) for morphine:creatinine ratio. <i>Conclusions</i>: In conclusion, this study provides tentative evidence that day 4 urinary codeine O-demethylation metabolites could predict non-response following a short course of codeine and could be utilised in the clinical assessment of codeine response at the point of care to improve analgesic efficacy and safety in codeine therapy. We offer a scoring system to predict codeine response from urinary morphine and urinary morphine:creatinine ratio collected on the morning of day 4 of codeine 30 mg QDS, but this requires validation before it could be considered for use to assess codeine response in clinical practice.	1749	1765	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	urinary morphine	urinary morphine
<i>Background and</i> <i>Objectives</i>: Codeine requires biotransformation by the <i>CYP2D6</i> enzyme, encoded by the polymorphic <i>CYP2D6</i> gene, to morphine for therapeutic efficacy. CYP2D6 phenotypes of poor, intermediate, and ultra-rapid metabolisers are at risk of codeine non-response and adverse drug reactions due to altered CYP2D6 function. The aim of this study was to determine whether genotype, inferred phenotype, and urinary and oral fluid codeine O-demethylation metabolites could predict codeine non-response following a short course of codeine. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: There were 131 Caucasians with persistent pain enrolled. Baseline assessments were recorded, prohibited medications ceased, and DNA sampling completed before commencing codeine 30 mg QDS for 5 days. Day 4 urine samples were collected 1-2 h post morning dose for codeine O-demethylation metabolites analysis. Final pain assessments were conducted on day 5. <i>Results</i>: None of the poor, intermediate, ultra-rapid metabolisers and only 24.5% of normal metabolisers responded to codeine. A simple scoring system to predict analgesic response from day 4 urinary metabolites was devised with overall prediction success of 79% (sensitivity 0.8, specificity 0.78) for morphine and 79% (sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.83) for morphine:creatinine ratio. <i>Conclusions</i>: In conclusion, this study provides tentative evidence that day 4 urinary codeine O-demethylation metabolites could predict non-response following a short course of codeine and could be utilised in the clinical assessment of codeine response at the point of care to improve analgesic efficacy and safety in codeine therapy.

The CYP2D6 gene is the most well characterized gene involved in drug metabolism and is known to have both gene duplication and deletion variants. We report an optimized method for the determination of copy number variation (CNV) in the CYP2D6 gene by a novel purification process for a real-time quantitative PCR. This high-throughput low-cost method accurately determines CNV in the CYP2D6 gene enabling reliable estimates of disease prediction in large epidemiological samples.	427	434	CANCER	disease	disease
Atomoxetine is a nonstimulant medication used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 polymorphisms influence the metabolism of atomoxetine thereby affecting drug efficacy and safety. We summarize evidence from the published literature supporting these associations and provide therapeutic recommendations for atomoxetine based on CYP2D6 genotype (updates at www.cpicpgx.org).	97	101	CANCER	ADHD	ADHD
Although in recent years, chemotherapeutic options for colorectal carcinoma have expanded, overall response rates are still too low, with high rates of toxicity. Pharmacogenetics aim at predicting both treatment response and adverse effects in individual patients. This review describes the current knowledge of pharmacogenetic markers in the systemic treatment of colorectal cancer. UGT1A1*28 leads to reduced conjugation of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, resulting in an increased rate of adverse effects, especially neutropenia. To a lesser extent, increased 5-FU toxicity is predicted by DPYD*2A. A variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism in the thymidylate synthase enhancer region, in combination with a single nucleotide polymorphism C>G, may predict poorer response to 5-FU. Efficacy of oxaliplatin is influenced by polymorphisms in components of DNA repair systems, such as ERCC1 and XRCC1. Polymorphic changes in the endothelial growth factor receptor probably predict cetuximab efficacy. Furthermore, the antibody-depended cell-mediated cytotoxic effect of cetuximab may be reduced by polymorphisms in the immunoglobin G fragment C receptors. Bevacizumab efficacy is suspected to be influenced by polymorphisms in the VEGF gene and the hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha gene. Although the interpretation of pharmacogenetic studies is complicated, results imply a promising way of pretreatment prediction of chemotherapy efficacy and toxicity.	55	75	CANCER	colorectal carcinoma	colorectal carcinoma

The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of CYP2D6 activity on the efficacy and safety of mirtazapine in patients with depressive disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorder who received mirtazapine. The study included 109 Russian patients who received mirtazapine at a dose of 30.0 [15.0; 45.0] mg per day. Genotyping of <i>CYP2D6*4</i> (<i>1846G > A</i>, <i>rs3892097</i>) was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction with allele-specific hybridization. The activity of CYP2D6 was evaluated by determining the concentration of endogenous substrate of the enzyme and its urinary metabolite - pinoline to 6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline ratio, using high-performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. The statistically significant differences between the scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) in patients with different genotypes were revealed by day 16: (<i>GG</i>) 5.0 [3.0; 6.0], (<i>GA</i>) 1.5 [1.0; 3.2] (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and for the The UKU Side Effects Rating Scale (UKU): (<i>GG</i>) 6.0 [6.0; 7.0], (<i>GA</i>) 8.5 [8.0; 10.0] (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The calculation of correlation coefficients between the differences in scale scores and metabolic rate showed the presence of statistically significant weak inverse correlation with the efficacy indicator evaluated by HAMD (<i>r</i> = -0.278, <i>p</i> < 0.05), but not by UKU (<i>r</i> = 0.274, <i>p</i> > 0.05). This study demonstrated that an increased CYP2D6 activity reduces the efficacy of treatment with mirtazapine.	600	607	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	urinary	urinary
Venous thrombosis (VT) is a highly prevalent disease. Risk factors can be genetic or acquired. The well-established genetic polymorphisms predisposing to thrombophilic disorders can be divided into rare 'loss-of-function mutations' in anticoagulant proteins and common 'gain-of-function mutations' in procoagulant proteins, which are weaker risk factors. In addition to functional polymorphisms, defects in common pathways affecting biosynthesis or clearance of plasma coagulation factors and their relations to VT risk have been detected. Recently, investigations regarding genetic variations and response to drug treatment, relevant for the pathogenesis as well as therapy of venous thromboembolism have been performed. The methodical advances in genetic research have led to the identification of a number of new variants with still unclear association to VT. This review aims to discuss the established genetic risk factors as well as some candidate predictors of VT. Further, the recent developments in pharmacogenomics are reviewed.	462	468	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma	plasma
Warfarin remains the oral anticoagulant of choice in sub-Saharan Africa. However, dosing is challenging due to a highly variable clinical response for a given dose. This study aimed to develop and validate a clinical warfarin dose-initiation model in sub-Saharan Black-African patients. For the development cohort, we used data from 364 patients who were recruited from 8 outpatient clinics and hospital departments in Uganda and South Africa (June 2018-July 2019). Validation was undertaken using the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC) dataset (690 black patients). Four predictors (age, weight, target International Normalized Ratio range, and HIV status) were included in the final model, which achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs; mean of absolute differences between true dose and dose predicted by the model) of 11.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10.4-12.8) and 12.5 (95% CI 11.6-13.4) mg/week in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. Two other clinical models, IWPC and Gage, respectively, obtained MAEs of 12.5 (95% CI 11.3-13.7) and 12.7 (95% CI 11.5-13.8) mg/week in the development cohort, and 12.1 (95% CI 11.2-13.0) and 12.2 (95% CI 11.4-13.1) mg/week in the validation cohort. Compared with fixed dose-initiation, our model decreased the percentage of patients at high risk of suboptimal anticoagulation by 7.5% (1.5-13.7%) and 11.9% (7.1-16.8%) in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The clinical utility of this model will be tested in a prospective study. Study Highlights WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? ☑ Warfarin dosing remains challenging due to a highly variable clinical response for a given dose. WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? ☑ Can a clinical dose-initiation model be developed and validated for sub-Saharan Black-African patients? WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? ☑ We have developed the first warfarin dose-initiation clinical model for Black-African patients in Uganda and South Africa. HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE? ☑ We will be implementing and validating this model in a prospective cohort to inform future large-scale implementation. More optimized dosing should improve the quality of warfarin anticoagulation in these two developing countries.	21	39	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral anticoagulant	oral anticoagulant

The pharmacokinetics of the atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, display large interindividual variation leading to multiple-fold differences in drug exposure between patients at a given dose. This variation in turn gives rise to the need for individualized dosing in order to avoid concentration-dependent adverse effects or therapeutic failure. Genetically determined differences in olanzapine metabolism represent a less studied source of variability in comparison to environmental and physiological factors. In this review, we summarize available in vitro and in vivo data addressing the influence of polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes on olanzapine serum exposure. The polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme appears to have no significant influence on olanzapine steady-state serum concentrations. The formation of the various olanzapine metabolites is influenced by polymorphisms in the genes coding for CYP1A2, CYP1A expression regulator AHR, UGT1A4 and UGT2B10, as well as FMO3. An impact on steady-state olanzapine serum concentrations has been suggested for variants of CYP1A2 and UGT1A4, with somewhat conflicting findings. The potential involvement of FMO1 and CYP3A43 in olanzapine disposition has also been suggested but needs future validation.	661	666	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum	serum

Early prediction of clearance mechanisms allows for the rapid progression of drug discovery and development programs, and facilitates risk assessment of the pharmacokinetic variability associated with drug interactions and pharmacogenomics. Here we propose a scientific framework--Extended Clearance Classification System (ECCS)--which can be used to predict the predominant clearance mechanism (rate-determining process) based on physicochemical properties and passive membrane permeability. Compounds are classified as: Class 1A--metabolism as primary systemic clearance mechanism (high permeability acids/zwitterions with molecular weight (MW) ≤400 Da), Class 1B--transporter-mediated hepatic uptake as primary systemic clearance mechanism (high permeability acids/zwitterions with MW >400 Da), Class 2--metabolism as primary clearance mechanism (high permeability bases/neutrals), Class 3A--renal clearance (low permeability acids/zwitterions with MW ≤400 Da), Class 3B--transporter mediated hepatic uptake or renal clearance (low permeability acids/zwitterions with MW >400 Da), and Class 4--renal clearance (low permeability bases/neutrals). The performance of the ECCS framework was validated using 307 compounds with single clearance mechanism contributing to ≥70% of systemic clearance. The apparent permeability across clonal cell line of Madin - Darby canine kidney cells, selected for low endogenous efflux transporter expression, with a cut-off of 5 × 10(-6) cm/s was used for permeability classification, and the ionization (at pH7) was assigned based on calculated pKa. The proposed scheme correctly predicted the rate-determining clearance mechanism to be either metabolism, hepatic uptake or renal for ~92% of total compounds. We discuss the general characteristics of each ECCS class, as well as compare and contrast the framework with the biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) and the biopharmaceutics drug disposition classification system (BDDCS). Collectively, the ECCS framework is valuable in early prediction of clearance mechanism and can aid in choosing the right preclinical tool kit and strategy for optimizing drug exposure and evaluating clinical risk of pharmacokinetic variability caused by drug interactions and pharmacogenomics.	470	478	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	membrane	membrane

The proposed scheme correctly predicted the rate-determining clearance mechanism to be either metabolism, hepatic uptake or renal for ~92% of total compounds. We discuss the general characteristics of each ECCS class, as well as compare and contrast the framework with the biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) and the biopharmaceutics drug disposition classification system (BDDCS). Collectively, the ECCS framework is valuable in early prediction of clearance mechanism and can aid in choosing the right preclinical tool kit and strategy for optimizing drug exposure and evaluating clinical risk of pharmacokinetic variability caused by drug interactions and pharmacogenomics.	1014	1019	CANCER	renal	renal
Early prediction of clearance mechanisms allows for the rapid progression of drug discovery and development programs, and facilitates risk assessment of the pharmacokinetic variability associated with drug interactions and pharmacogenomics. Here we propose a scientific framework--Extended Clearance Classification System (ECCS)--which can be used to predict the predominant clearance mechanism (rate-determining process) based on physicochemical properties and passive membrane permeability. Compounds are classified as: Class 1A--metabolism as primary systemic clearance mechanism (high permeability acids/zwitterions with molecular weight (MW) ≤400 Da), Class 1B--transporter-mediated hepatic uptake as primary systemic clearance mechanism (high permeability acids/zwitterions with MW >400 Da), Class 2--metabolism as primary clearance mechanism (high permeability bases/neutrals), Class 3A--renal clearance (low permeability acids/zwitterions with MW ≤400 Da), Class 3B--transporter mediated hepatic uptake or renal clearance (low permeability acids/zwitterions with MW >400 Da), and Class 4--renal clearance (low permeability bases/neutrals).

Telatinib is an orally active small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of kinase insert domain receptor (KDR; VEGFR-2) and fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4; VEGFR-3). This study aims at the identification of relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding for transporter proteins and pharmacokinetic parameters in order to clarify the significant interpatient variability in drug exposure. In addition, the potential relationship between target receptor polymorphisms and toxicity of telatinib is explored.	45	53	AMINO_ACID	tyrosine	tyrosine
Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis (CRSwNP) affects the quality of life of patients suffering from it. The search for a suitable biomarker has been conducted over the last decades. Interleukin 5 receptor subunit alpha (IL-5Rα) involves the activation, maintenance, and survival of eosinophils, which are highly tied to chronic inflammatory processes of the airways, like asthma or CRSwNP. In this study, we evaluate the utility of <i>IL5RA</i> as a genetic biomarker in CRSwNP. <i>IL5RA</i> mRNA expression level was analyzed in different groups of patients by performing qPCR assays. A significant increase in <i>IL5RA</i> expression was observed in CRSwNP patients, especially those with asthma and atopy. We found differences in expression levels when comparing groups with or without polyposis or asthma, as well as some atypical cases related to eosinophil levels. That opens a path to future studies to further characterize groups of patients with common features in the context of pharmacogenetics and in an era towards developing a more precise personalized treatment with IL-5Rα as a therapeutic target for CRSwNP.	28	33	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	Nasal	Nasal

Experimental studies have demonstrated that methylphenidate (MPH) modulates the synaptic vesicle trafficking and synaptotagmin-1 (SytI) mRNA levels. SytI is a regulatory protein of the SNARE complex, a neurotransmitter exocytosis mediator. Despite this evidence, most SNARE complex-related genes have never been evaluated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) pharmacogenetics. This study evaluates, for we believe the first time, polymorphisms on the SNARE complex-related genes STX1A (rs2228607), VAMP2 (26bp Ins/Del) and SYT1 (rs1880867 and rs2251214) on the response to immediate-release methylphenidate (IR-MPH) in a naturalistic sample of adults with ADHD. The sample comprised 433 subjects, of which 272 (62.8%) have completed the short-term IR-MPH treatment (at least 30 days). The main outcome measure was the categorical variable of short-term response to IR-MPH based on the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Rating Scale version 4 (SNAP-IV), and on the clinical global impression-improvement scale. Additional analyses evaluated the percentage of SNAP-IV symptom reduction for each dimension as well as short- and long- (7 years) term treatment persistence. SYT1-rs2251214 was associated with the categorical short-term response to IR-MPH (P=0.006, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.028), and with the percentage of inattention and oppositional defiant disorder symptoms reduction (P=0.007, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.028 and P=0.017, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.048, respectively). SYT1-rs2251214 was also associated with short-term treatment persistence (P=0.018, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.048), and with months of treatment (P=0.002, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.016) in the long-term protocol. Our findings suggest that SYT1-rs2251214 presents a broad influence in IR-MPH response variability in adults with ADHD, being involved with both symptom response and treatment persistence. If such findings are replicated, SytI could represent a key element in MPH pharmacodynamics in adults with ADHD.	61	64	CANCER	MPH	MPH

SYT1-rs2251214 was also associated with short-term treatment persistence (P=0.018, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.048), and with months of treatment (P=0.002, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.016) in the long-term protocol. Our findings suggest that SYT1-rs2251214 presents a broad influence in IR-MPH response variability in adults with ADHD, being involved with both symptom response and treatment persistence. If such findings are replicated, SytI could represent a key element in MPH pharmacodynamics in adults with ADHD.	80	96	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	synaptic vesicle	synaptic vesicle
Experimental studies have demonstrated that methylphenidate (MPH) modulates the synaptic vesicle trafficking and synaptotagmin-1 (SytI) mRNA levels. SytI is a regulatory protein of the SNARE complex, a neurotransmitter exocytosis mediator. Despite this evidence, most SNARE complex-related genes have never been evaluated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) pharmacogenetics. This study evaluates, for we believe the first time, polymorphisms on the SNARE complex-related genes STX1A (rs2228607), VAMP2 (26bp Ins/Del) and SYT1 (rs1880867 and rs2251214) on the response to immediate-release methylphenidate (IR-MPH) in a naturalistic sample of adults with ADHD. The sample comprised 433 subjects, of which 272 (62.8%) have completed the short-term IR-MPH treatment (at least 30 days). The main outcome measure was the categorical variable of short-term response to IR-MPH based on the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Rating Scale version 4 (SNAP-IV), and on the clinical global impression-improvement scale.

The combined use of diagnostic and therapeutic radioligands with the same molecular target, also known as theranostics, enables accurate patient selection, targeted therapy, and prediction of treatment response. Radioiodine, bone-seeking radioligands and norepinephrine analogs have been used for many years for diagnostic imaging and radioligand therapy of thyroid carcinoma, bone metastases, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, and neuroblastoma, respectively. In recent years, radiolabeled somatostatin analogs and prostate-specific membrane antigen ligands have shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer, respectively. Several candidate compounds are targeting novel theranostic targets such as fibroblast activation protein, C-X-C chemokine receptor 4, and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. In addition, several strategies to improve efficacy of radioligand therapy are being evaluated, including dosimetry-based dose optimization, multireceptor targeting, upregulation of target receptors, radiosensitization, pharmacogenomics, and radiation genomics. Design and evaluation of novel radioligands and optimization of dose and dose schedules, within the complex context of individualized multimodal cancer treatment, requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes clinical pharmacology. Significant increases in the use of these radiopharmaceuticals in routine oncological practice can be expected, which will have major impact on patient care as well as (radio)pharmacy utilization.	358	375	CANCER	thyroid carcinoma	thyroid carcinoma

Genetic variation in genes encoding cytochrome <i>P450</i> enzymes has important clinical implications for drug metabolism. Bioinformatics algorithms for genotyping these highly polymorphic genes using high-throughput sequence data and automating phenotype prediction have recently been developed. The <i>CYP2D6</i> gene is often used as a model during the validation of these algorithms due to its clinical importance, high polymorphism, and structural variations. However, the validation process is often limited to common star alleles due to scarcity of reference datasets. In addition, there has been no comprehensive benchmark of these algorithms to date. We performed a systematic comparison of three star allele calling algorithms using 4618 simulations as well as 75 whole-genome sequence samples from the GeT-RM project. Overall, we found that Aldy and Astrolabe are better suited to call both common and rare diplotypes compared to Stargazer, which is affected by population structure. Aldy was the best performing algorithm in calling <i>CYP2D6</i> structural variants followed by Stargazer, whereas Astrolabe had limitations especially in calling hybrid rearrangements. We found that ensemble genotyping, characterised by taking a consensus of genotypes called by all three algorithms, has higher haplotype concordance but it is prone to ambiguities whenever complete discrepancies between the tools arise. Further, we evaluated the effects of sequencing coverage and indel misalignment on genotyping accuracy. Our account of the strengths and limitations of these algorithms is extremely important to clinicians and researchers in the pharmacogenomics and precision medicine communities looking to haplotype <i>CYP2D6</i> and other pharmacogenes using high-throughput sequencing data.	36	46	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	cytochrome	cytochrome

Hypertension is a complex, multifactorial disease; genetic factors represent one third to half of the inter-individual variability of blood pressure values. Among the causes of secondary hypertension are a group of disorders with a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Recent advances in molecular biology have revealed the pathogenesis of hypertension in many of these conditions. Remarkably, the mechanism in every case has proved to be upregulation of sodium Na reabsorption in the distal nephron, with accompanying expansion of extracellular volume. On the contrary in the essential hypertension the underlying pathogenetic mechanism is more complex because of interplay between several 'risk' genes and environmental factors. It is assumed that blood pressure is under the control of a large number of genes each of which has only relatively mild effects. It has therefore been difficult to discover the genes that contribute to blood pressure variation using traditional approaches including candidate gene studies and linkage studies. Recent development of genotyping technology made large scale genome-wide association studies possible. This approach and the study of monogenic forms of hypertension has led to the discovery of novel and robust candidate genes for human essential hypertension, many of which require functional analysis in experimental models. This review summarizes the current findings for candidate genes associated with blood pressure and focuses on recent advances and future potential of pharmacogenetics of hypertension, with the intent to clarify what amount of these investments in basic science research will be delivered into benefits to patients.	134	139	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood	blood

Background.  Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) identify genetic associations across multiple phenotypes. Clinical trials offer opportunities for PheWAS to identify pharmacogenomic associations. We describe the first PheWAS to use genome-wide genotypic data and to utilize human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinical trials data. As proof-of-concept, we focused on baseline laboratory phenotypes from antiretroviral therapy-naive individuals. Methods.  Data from 4 AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) studies were split into 2 datasets: Dataset I (1181 individuals from protocol A5202) and Dataset II (1366 from protocols A5095, ACTG 384, and A5142). Final analyses involved 2547 individuals and 5 954 294 imputed polymorphisms. We calculated comprehensive associations between these polymorphisms and 27 baseline laboratory phenotypes. Results.  A total of 10 584 (0.17%) polymorphisms had associations with P < .01 in both datasets and with the same direction of association. Twenty polymorphisms replicated associations with identical or related phenotypes reported in the Catalog of Published Genome-Wide Association Studies, including several not previously reported in HIV-positive cohorts. We also identified several possibly novel associations. Conclusions.  These analyses define PheWAS properties and principles with baseline laboratory data from HIV clinical trials. This approach may be useful for evaluating on-treatment HIV clinical trials data for associations with various clinical phenotypes.	13	25	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	Phenome-Wide	Phenome-Wide
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. In recent decades, OS treatment has reached a plateau and drug resistance is still a major challenge. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the expression of the genes related to pharmacogenetics in OS. The expression of 32 target genes in 80 paired specimens (pre-chemotherapeutic primary tumor, post-chemotherapeutic primary tumor and pulmonary metastasis) obtained from 33 patients diagnosed with OS were analyzed by the real-time PCR methodology. As the calibrators (control), five normal bone specimens were used. The present study identified associations between the OS outcome and the expression of the genes <i>TOP2A</i>, <i>DHFR</i>, <i>MTHFR</i>, <i>BCL2L1</i>, <i>CASP3</i>, <i>FASLG</i>, <i>GSTM3</i>, <i>SOD1</i>, ABCC1, <i>ABCC2</i>, <i>ABCC3</i>, <i>ABCC5</i>, <i>ABCC6</i>, <i>ABCC10</i>, <i>ABCC11</i>, <i>ABCG2</i>, <i>RALBP1</i>, <i>SLC19A1</i>, <i>SLC22A1</i>, <i>ERCC1</i> and <i>MSH2</i>. In addition, the expression of the <i>ABCC10</i>, <i>GGH</i>, <i>GSTM3</i> and <i>SLC22A1</i> genes were associated with the disease event, and the metastasis specimens showed a high expression profile of <i>ABCC1</i>, <i>ABCC3</i> and <i>ABCC4</i> genes and a low expression of <i>SLC22A1</i> and <i>ABCC10</i> genes, which is possibly an important factor for resistance in OS metastasis. Therefore, our findings may, in the future, contribute to clinical management as prognostic factors as well as possible therapeutic targets.	432	441	ORGAN	pulmonary	pulmonary

Nimodipine, an L-type cerebroselective calcium channel antagonist, is the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the neuroprotection of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Four randomized, placebo-controlled trials of nimodipine demonstrated clinical improvement over placebo; however, these occurred before precision medicine with pharmacogenomics was readily available. The standard enteral dose of nimodipine recommended after aSAH is 60 mg every 4 h. However, up to 78% of patients with aSAH develop systemic arterial hypotension after taking the drug at the recommended dose, which could theoretically limit its neuroprotective role and worsen cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral blood flow, particularly when concomitant vasospasm is present. We investigated the association between nimodipine dose changes and clinical outcomes in a consecutive series of 150 patients (mean age, 56 years; 70.7% women) with acute aSAH. We describe the pharmacogenomic relationship of nimodipine dose reduction with clinical outcomes. These results have major implications for future individualized dosing of nimodipine in the era of precision medicine.	15	21	CELL	L-type	L-type

<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To examine whether serotonin (5-HT) related genetic variants moderate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) at the radius, lumbar spine (LS) BMD, total body less head (TBLH) bone mineral content (BMC) and markers of bone metabolism (osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX-1], and bone specific alkaline phosphatase to CTX-1 ratio) were examined in an observational study, enrolling 15- to 20-year-old participants, unmedicated or within a month of SSRI initiation. Variants in <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295), <i>HTR1B</i> (rs6296), <i>HTR1D</i> (rs6300), <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311 and rs6314), <i>HTR2B</i> (rs6736017), and the serotonin transporter intron 2 variable number tandem repeat (STin2 VNTR) were genotyped. Linear mixed-effects regression analysis examined associations between SSRI use, genetic variants, and skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> After adjusting for relevant covariates, rs6295 CC and GC genotypes in 262 participants (60% female, mean ± SD age = 18.9 ± 1.6 years) were significantly associated with higher LS BMD compared to the GG genotype. Rs6311 GG SSRI users had greater LS BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.18, <i>p</i> = <0.0001). Female SSRI users with the combination of rs6295 CC+GC and rs6311 GG genotypes had greater LS BMD than female SSRI nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.29, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). SSRI users with the rs6295 GG genotype had higher trabecular BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 3.60, <i>p</i> = 0.05). No significant interactions were found for TBLH BMC or bone turnover markers. After correcting for multiple comparisons, none of the results retained significance. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> In older adolescents and young adults, <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295) and <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311) variants may moderate the effect of SSRIs on BMD. Sex differences may exist and require further examination. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm our preliminary findings. <b><i>Clinical Trial Registration:</i></b> clinicaltrials.gov NCT02147184.	161	169	ORGAN	skeletal	skeletal

Linear mixed-effects regression analysis examined associations between SSRI use, genetic variants, and skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> After adjusting for relevant covariates, rs6295 CC and GC genotypes in 262 participants (60% female, mean ± SD age = 18.9 ± 1.6 years) were significantly associated with higher LS BMD compared to the GG genotype. Rs6311 GG SSRI users had greater LS BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.18, <i>p</i> = <0.0001). Female SSRI users with the combination of rs6295 CC+GC and rs6311 GG genotypes had greater LS BMD than female SSRI nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.29, <i>p</i> < 0.0001).

Monitoring and treating iron overload is crucial in transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients. Liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography and T2* magnetic resonance imaging represent non-invasive ways to evaluate the adequacy of the iron chelation treatment. We explored the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in vitamin D metabolism, transport and activity, and in deferasirox metabolism on liver iron burden parameters. One-hundred and five beta-thalassaemia patients, treated with deferasirox, have been enrolled. Drug plasma C<sub>trough</sub> and AUC were measured by a HPLC-UV method. Allelic discrimination was performed by real-time PCR. Age, UGT1A1-364 CT/TT and CYP27B1 -1260 GT/TT positively predicted liver stiffness values. Deferasirox dose and serum ferritin negatively predicted T2* data, whereas age and CYP2D6 1457 GG genotype positively influenced these values. The discoveries of this research may be useful for personalized medicine and the proposed method could be applied in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and myelodysplastic syndromes.	97	102	ORGAN	Liver	Liver

Several pathological mutations have been identified in human POLG gene, encoding for the catalytic subunit of Pol γ, the solely mitochondrial replicase in animals and fungi. However, little is known regarding non-pathological polymorphisms found in this gene. Here we studied, in the yeast model Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eight human polymorphisms. We found that most of them are not neutral but enhanced both mtDNA extended mutability and the accumulation of mtDNA point mutations, either alone or in combination with a pathological mutation. In addition, we found that the presence of some SNPs increased the stavudine and/or zalcitabine-induced mtDNA mutability and instability.	128	141	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	mitochondrial	mitochondrial

In addition, we found that the presence of some SNPs increased the stavudine and/or zalcitabine-induced mtDNA mutability and instability.	460	465	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	mtDNA	mtDNA
Several pathological mutations have been identified in human POLG gene, encoding for the catalytic subunit of Pol γ, the solely mitochondrial replicase in animals and fungi. However, little is known regarding non-pathological polymorphisms found in this gene. Here we studied, in the yeast model Saccharomyces cerevisiae, eight human polymorphisms. We found that most of them are not neutral but enhanced both mtDNA extended mutability and the accumulation of mtDNA point mutations, either alone or in combination with a pathological mutation.

Pharmacogenomics(PGx) is believed to be the driver for adopting pre-emptive clinical genetic testing. We investigated two potential resources for enabling automated pharmacogenomic decision support. First, we analyzed pharmacogenomics dosing guidelines (PDGs) and how they might be executed to provide alerts for clinicians ordering drugs. Second, we use whole genome sequencing (WGS) data instead of genotyping arrays to obtain patients' genetic profiles. In a pilot study, we attempted to generate clinical recommendations (based on PDGs) for 69 patients whose genomes were obtained from a public data set provided by Compete Genomics. We report on the generated recommendations and the additional variations detected by WGS that are not well addressed by existing guidelines.	361	367	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome
Pharmacogenomics aims to reveal variants associated with drug response phenotypes. Genes whose roles involve the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs, are highly polymorphic between populations. High coverage whole genome sequencing showed that a large proportion of the variants for these genes are rare in African populations. This study investigated the impact of such variants on protein structure to assess their functional importance. We used genetic data of <i>CYP3A5</i> from 458 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa to conduct a structural bioinformatics analysis. Five missense variants were modeled and microsecond scale molecular dynamics simulations were conducted for each, as well as for the CYP3A5 wildtype and the Y53C variant, which has a known deleterious impact on enzyme activity. The binding of ritonavir and artemether to CYP3A5 variant structures was also evaluated. Our results showed different conformational characteristics between all the variants. No significant structural changes were noticed. However, the genetic variability seemed to act on the plasticity of the protein. The impact on drug binding might be drug dependant. We concluded that rare variants hold relevance in determining the pharmacogenomics properties of populations. This could have a significant impact on precision medicine applications in sub-Saharan Africa.	239	245	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome
<b>Background:</b> Globally, the use of amphetamines as therapeutic agents in pediatric medicine is a crucial area of concern, especially given the population's vulnerability. <b>Methods:</b> On 6 August 2023, a search was conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov using "amphetamine" as the keyword. Two independent examiners screened trials against set criteria, including a focus on amphetamine, completion status, an interventional approach, and included children. Ongoing or observational studies were excluded. Data extracted from the qualified trials encompassed primary objectives, participant counts, study duration, and outcomes, with the aim of analyzing children disorders treated by amphetamine. <b>Results:</b> On 6 August 2023, a search of the ClinicalTrials.gov database with the term "amphetamines" identified 179 clinical trials. After extensive exclusion criteria, 19 trials were ultimately selected for analysis. The predominant condition under investigation was attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), present in 84.2% of studies. Key study characteristics included: phase 4 trials (36.8%), randomized allocation (63.2%), and the parallel intervention model (42.1%). Masking techniques varied, with no masking in 42.1% of studies, and double and quadruple masking both accounting for 21.1%. Geographically, 78.9% of the studies' participants were from the United States. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study highlights the notable therapeutic potential of amphetamines in pediatric ADHD populations and emphasizes the importance of recognizing potential side effects and addiction risks. As pharmacogenomics offers the prospect of personalized treatments, there is potential to increase therapeutic efficacy and decrease adverse reactions. It is vital to balance these benefits against the inherent risks, understanding the need for continued research to optimize the use of amphetamines in medicine.	1	2	CELL	b	b

The study involved 341 apparently healthy, unrelated, and chronic medication-free volunteers of both sexes of ethnic groups of Tatars and Balkars living in Volga and Caucasus regions of Russia. Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction-based methods. The allelic prevalence of studied markers in ethnic groups were compared with Russians as a largest ethnic group in Russia. Statistically significant differences for the following gene polymorphisms were found between both ethnic groups in respect of different markers and with Russians. Our study shows differences in prevalence of the main relevant pharmacogenetic markers in Tatars and Balkars. These findings should be taken into consideration for personalization algorithms development and pharmacogenetics implementation in regions with ethnic minorities as Russia has.	88	96	CELL	CYP2C9*3	CYP2C9*3

The kidney has attracted the attention of diabetologists as an organ involved in the regulation of glucose homeostasis not only by gluconeogenesis, but also by renal glucose excretion. Sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs), particularly SGLT2, are responsible for reabsorption of up to 99% of the filtered glucose. SGLT2 is coded by the SLC5A2 gene, which maps on chromosome 16. Pharmacological reduction of tubular glucose reabsorption results in improved glycemic control in Type 2 diabetic patients. Since the SGLTs reabsorb most of the filtered glucose (90%), it is not surprising that mutations in SLC5A2 cause familial renal glucosuria. A recent study pointed out a possible role of common genetic variation in SLC5A2 in the control of glucose homeostasis. SLC5A2 polymorphisms might therefore represent potential candidates for pharmacogenomic studies targeting the impact of these variants on the efficacy of antidiabetic treatment that is based on inhibition of SGLT2 activity.	4	10	ORGAN	kidney	kidney

Psoriasis is a chronic, T cell-mediated skin disease affecting 2-3% of the Caucasian population. Cyclosporine A is a calcineurin inhibitor that acts selectively on T cells. The cyclosporine A treatment response has been suggested to be modulated by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <i>ABCB1</i> gene. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of <i>ABCB1</i> genetic variants that could affect the response to a cyclosporine treatment in Russian psoriasis patients with the <i>ABCB1</i> genotype status. The <i>ABCB1</i> T-129C, G1199A, C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T SNPs in the 168 patients with psoriasis were genotyped by PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism) and TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. The <i>ABCB1</i> C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T SNPs were significantly associated with a negative response to cyclosporine therapy. A very strong association was evident for the C3435T SNP in the <i>ABCB1</i> gene in the allele, dominant and recessive models (OR = 2.58, OR = 4.01, OR = 2.50, respectively). <i>ABCB1</i> C1236T and G2677T/A polymorphisms were significantly associated with a negative response to the cyclosporine therapy in the codominant, dominant and recessive models (<i>p</i> ˂ 0.05). Additionally, the haplotype analysis identified that the TGC haplotype is significantly associated with a negative response to cyclosporine therapy in psoriasis patients (<i>p</i> ˂ 0.05). The current study to the best of our knowledge is the first of its kind to be performed in the Russian population. In conclusion, the present results suggest an association between the <i>ABCB1</i> genetic variants and unresponsiveness to cyclosporine in the Russian population. Further, larger studies are necessary to confirm our findings and replicate them in various ethnic populations before its implementation in the clinical practice.	164	171	CELL	T cells	T cells

Paritaprevir (PTV) is a non-structural protein 3/4A protease inhibitor developed for the treatment of hepatitis C disease as a fixed dose combination of ombitasvir (OBV) and ritonavir (RTV) with or without dasabuvir. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 on in vitro PTV metabolism using human recombinant CYP3A4, CYP3A5 (rCYP3A4, rCYP3A5) and human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped as either CYP3A5*1/*1, CYP3A5*1/*3 or CYP3A5*3/*3. The intrinsic clearance (CL<sub>int</sub>, V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) for the production of a metabolite from PTV in rCYP3A4 was 1.5 times higher than that in rCYP3A5. The PTV metabolism in CYP3A5*1/*1 and CYP3A5*1/*3 HLMs expressing CYP3A5 was comparable to that in CYP3A5*3/*3 HLMs, which lack CYP3A5. CYP3A4 expression level was significantly correlated with PTV disappearance rate and metabolite formation. In contrast, there was no such correlation found for CYP3A5 expression level. This study represents that the major CYP isoform involved in PTV metabolism is CYP3A4, with CYP3A5 having a minor role in PTV metabolism. The findings of the present study may provide foundational information on PTV metabolism, and may further support dosing practices in HCV-infected patients prescribed PTV-based therapy.	308	311	ORGAN	PTV	PTV

CYP3A4 expression level was significantly correlated with PTV disappearance rate and metabolite formation. In contrast, there was no such correlation found for CYP3A5 expression level. This study represents that the major CYP isoform involved in PTV metabolism is CYP3A4, with CYP3A5 having a minor role in PTV metabolism. The findings of the present study may provide foundational information on PTV metabolism, and may further support dosing practices in HCV-infected patients prescribed PTV-based therapy.	652	655	TISSUE	PTV	PTV

In spite of promising preclinical results there is a decreasing number of new registered medications in major depression. The main reason behind this fact is the lack of confirmation in clinical studies for the assumed, and in animals confirmed, therapeutic results. This suggests low predictive value of animal studies for central nervous system disorders. One solution for identifying new possible targets is the application of genetics and genomics, which may pinpoint new targets based on the effect of genetic variants in humans. The present review summarizes such research focusing on depression and its therapy. The inconsistency between most genetic studies in depression suggests, first of all, a significant role of environmental stress. Furthermore, effect of individual genes and polymorphisms is weak, therefore gene x gene interactions or complete biochemical pathways should be analyzed. Even genes encoding target proteins of currently used antidepressants remain non-significant in genome-wide case control investigations suggesting no main effect in depression, but rather an interaction with stress. The few significant genes in GWASs are related to neurogenesis, neuronal synapse, cell contact and DNA transcription and as being nonspecific for depression are difficult to harvest pharmacologically. Most candidate genes in replicable gene x environment interactions, on the other hand, are connected to the regulation of stress and the HPA axis and thus could serve as drug targets for depression subgroups characterized by stress-sensitivity and anxiety while other risk polymorphisms such as those related to prominent cognitive symptoms in depression may help to identify additional subgroups and their distinct treatment. Until these new targets find their way into therapy, the optimization of current medications can be approached by pharmacogenomics, where metabolizing enzyme polymorphisms remain prominent determinants of therapeutic success.	324	346	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system	central nervous system

Metoprolol is a medication commonly utilized in select patients to achieve a reduction in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, or other indications. A majority of metoprolol metabolism occurs via <i>CYP2D6</i>. Decreased expression of the CYP2D6 enzyme increases the concentration of metoprolol. Current pharmacogenomics guidelines by the Dutch Pharmacogenomics Working Group recommend slower titrations and dose decreases to minimize adverse effects from poor metabolizers or normal metabolizers taking concomitant medications that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 (phenoconverters). This study aimed to evaluate adverse effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, and syncope in patients who are expected to have absent CYP2D6 enzyme activity due to drug-drug or drug-gene interactions. The secondary aims of this study were to evaluate heart rate measurements for the included participants. Retrospective data were collected for individuals with <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping results obtained for clinical purposes. Three categories (CYP2D6 normal metabolizers, poor metabolizers, and phenoconverters) were assigned. A total of 325 participants were included. There was no statistically significant difference found in the primary composite outcome between the three metabolizer groups (<i>p</i> = 0.054). However, a statistically significant difference was identified in the incidences of bradycardia between the poor metabolizers and the normal metabolizers or phenoconverters (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The average heart rates were 2.8 beats per minute (bpm) and 2.6 bpm lower for the poor metabolizer and phenoconverter groups, respectively, compared to the normal metabolizers (<i>p</i> < 0.0001 for both comparisons). This study further supports the role of genetic testing in precision medicine to help individualize patient care as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking metoprolol were found to have an increase in bradycardia. Additional research is needed to clarify the dose relationship in this drug-gene interaction.	90	95	ORGAN	heart	heart

A review of the pharmacogenetics (PGt) and pathophysiology of calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 S (CACNA1S) mutations in malignant hyperthermia susceptibility type 5 (MHS5; MIM #60188) is presented. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a life-threatening hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle usually induced by volatile, halogenated anesthetics and/or the depolarizing neuromuscular blocker succinylcholine. In addition to ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) mutations, several CACNA1S mutations are known to be risk factors for increased susceptibility to MH (MHS). However, the presence of these pathogenic CACNA1S gene variations cannot be used to positively predict MH since the condition is genetically heterogeneous with variable expression and incomplete penetrance. At present, one or at most six CACNA1S mutations display significant linkage or association either to clinically diagnosed MH or to MHS as determined by contracture testing. Additional pathogenic variants in CACNA1S, either alone or in combination with genes affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, are likely to be discovered in association to MH as whole exome sequencing becomes more commonplace.	284	299	ORGAN	skeletal muscle	skeletal muscle

Data on frequency of pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in the UK population are limited. However, availability of whole genome sequencing data on 94 UK controls of European ethnicity from the 1000 genomes project together with similar data on other populations provides a valuable new source of data in this area and allows direct comparison of allele frequencies with those for other European populations. The ethnic diversity of the UK population also needs to be considered, and 1000 genomes includes data on South Asians, the most common ethnic group in the UK after White Europeans. Allele frequencies for polymorphisms in genes relevant to phase I and phase II drug metabolism for UK, Finnish, Spanish and South Asian populations were obtained from the literature and 1000 genomes. Generally there was good agreement between the literature and 1000 genomes reports. CYP2D6*4, the most common CYP2D6 poor metabolizer allele among Europeans, appears more common in the UK than in Spain and Finland, whereas, as suggested previously, CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C9*2 appear more common in Finland and Spain, respectively, than in the UK. South Asians show low frequencies of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C19*17 but higher frequencies of CYP2C19*2 compared with UK residents of European ethnicity. Though personalizing drug treatment on the basis of individual genotype rather than ethnicity may be more appropriate, differences in allele frequencies across continents should be considered when designing clinical trials of new drugs.	116	122	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome
Agonists and antagonists of G protein-coupled receptors are important drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but the therapeutic response of any given patient remains difficult to predict because of large interindividual variability. Among the factors potentially contributing to such variability, we have reviewed the evidence for a role of pharmacodynamic pharmacogenetics (i.e., polymorphisms in the cognate receptors for such drugs as well as other proteins potentially modifying their action). Based upon the availability of data and the prevalence of use, we have focused on ligands at adrenergic and angiotensin II receptors (including the indirectly acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). The vast majority of gene polymorphisms reviewed here have shown only inconsistent effects on drug action, which does not make these polymorphisms useful genetic markers to predict treatment responses. We conclude that considerable additional research, partly involving other types of study than those available now, will be necessary to allow a definitive judgment whether pharmacodynamic pharmacogenetic markers are useful in an individualized approach to cardiovascular therapy. Moreover, we predict that even such additional research will result in only few cases where the promise of tailored treatment can be fulfilled; however, some of these few cases may be of major clinical relevance.	0	8	CELL	Agonists	Agonists

The authors tried to verify this hypothesis by testing for possible associations between two muscarinic receptor genes (<i>CHRM1</i> and <i>CHRM2</i>) polymorphisms and TD in patients with schizophrenia.<b>Methods:</b> A total of 472 patients with schizophrenia were recruited. TD was assessed cross-sectionally using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale. Fourteen allelic variants of <i>CHRM1</i> and <i>CHRM2</i> were genotyped using Applied Biosystems amplifiers (USA) and the MassARRAY System by Agena Bioscience.<b>Results:</b> The prevalence of the rs1824024*GG genotype of the <i>CHRM2</i> gene was lower in TD patients compared to the group without it (χ2 = 6.035, <i>p</i> = 0.049). This suggested that this genotype has a protective effect for the development of TD (OR = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.19-0.88). When age, gender, duration of schizophrenia and dosage of antipsychotic treatment were added as covariates in regression analysis, the results did not reach statistical significance.<b>Conclusions:</b> This study did identify associations between <i>CHRM2</i> variations and TD; the results of logistic regression analysis with covariates suggest that the association is, however, likely to be secondary to other concomitant factors.	1	2	CELL	b	b
<b>Background:</b> The research considers the impact of genotype-inferred variability on blood levels of amitriptyline and its main metabolites, as may be moderated by phenocopying. <b>Patients & methods:</b><i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i> genotypes, and serum concentrations of amitriptyline, nortriptyline and hydroxymetabolites, were determined in 33 outpatients. Co-medications were reviewed to identify CYP inhibition risk. <b>Results:</b> CYP2C19 metabolizer status explained interpatient variation in nortriptyline to amitriptyline concentration ratios. The hydroxymetabolite to parent ratios increased with higher CYP2D6 activity scores and lower CYP2D6 inhibition risk. In patients at high CYP2D6 inhibition risk, the amitriptyline + nortriptyline concentration was, on average, 52% above the higher end of expected ranges. <b>Conclusion:</b> Practical construal of pharmacogenetics and drug interactions tantamount to aberrant metabolism can facilitate patient-tailored use of the established drug.	1	2	CELL	b	b

Advances in pharmacogenomics have paved the way for personalized medicine. Cardiovascular diseases still represent the leading cause of mortality in the world. The aim of this review is to summarize the background, rationale, and evidence of pharmacogenomics in cardiovascular medicine, in particular, the use of antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, and drugs used for the treatment of dyslipidemia.	75	89	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	Cardiovascular	Cardiovascular
From the perspective of current and future patients, the development of the field of pharmacogenetics is of immense interest. The encouraging vision that is now being established is that we may move from trial and error therapies to evidence-based personalized medicine in clinical practice. However, research and the application of pharmacogenetics to clinical practice are believed to raise a host of controversial ethical issues. Some of these are related to the research process, for example, confidentiality and informed consent in association with human tissue sampling. Other issues arise on a societal level, for example, issues regarding justice and the use of race or ethnicity as proxies for genotyping. In this perspective, I comment on this debate and also suggest what we may learn from previous discussions regarding DNA testing and gene transfer methods. Arguably, the most important ethical perspective in medical research and drug development is related to the interests of patients wanting medical treatment that is both effective and carries low risks of adverse effects. Risk:benefit ratios must always be compared with existing alternatives, and while the risk of adverse effects may be tolerable for some individuals, owing to genetic reasons, this may not be relevant for others. This will have consequences for regulatory policies regarding drug development. In the future, personalized medicine will also need to take epigenetic and environmental factors into consideration.	832	835	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA
In kidney transplantation, tacrolimus (TAC) is at the cornerstone of current immunosuppressive strategies. Though because of its narrow therapeutic index, it is critical to ensure that TAC levels are maintained within this sharp window through reactive adjustments. This would allow maximizing efficiency while limiting drug-associated toxicity. However, TAC high intra- and inter-patient pharmacokinetic (PK) variability makes it more laborious to accurately predict the appropriate dosage required for a given patient.	3	9	ORGAN	kidney	kidney
<b>Introduction</b>: Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is an adverse effect of several classes of chemotherapy including the taxanes. Predictive PN biomarkers could inform individualized taxane treatment to reduce PN and enhance therapeutic outcomes. Pharmacogenetics studies of taxane-induced PN have focused on genes involved in pharmacokinetics, including enzymes and transporters. Contradictory findings from these studies prevent translation of genetic biomarkers into clinical practice. <b>Areas covered</b>: This review discusses the progress toward identifying pharmacogenetic predictors of PN by assessing the evidence for two independent associations; the effect of pharmacogenetics on taxane pharmacokinetics and the evidence that taxane pharmacokinetics affects PN. Assessing these direct relationships allows the reader to understand the progress toward individualized taxane treatment and future research opportunities. <b>Expert opinion</b>: Paclitaxel pharmacokinetics is a major determinant of PN. Additional clinical trials are needed to confirm the clinical benefit of individualized dosing to achieve target paclitaxel exposure. Genetics does not meaningfully contribute to paclitaxel pharmacokinetics and may not be useful to inform dosing. However, genetics may contribute to PN sensitivity and could be useful for estimating patients' optimal paclitaxel exposure. For docetaxel, genetics has not been demonstrated to have a meaningful effect on pharmacokinetics and there is no evidence that pharmacokinetics determines PN.	1	2	CELL	b	b

Oxaliplatin (OXAL) is a commonly used chemotherapy for treating colorectal cancer (CRC). A recent genome wide association study (GWAS) showed that a genetic variant (rs11006706) in the lncRNA gene <i>MKX-AS1</i> and partnered sense gene <i>MKX</i> could impact the response of genetically varied cell lines to OXAL treatment. This study found that the expression levels of <i>MKX-AS1</i> and <i>MKX</i> in lymphocytes (LCLs) and CRC cell lines differed between the rs11006706 genotypes, indicating that this gene pair could play a role in OXAL response. Further analysis of patient survival data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other sources showed that patients with high <i>MKX-AS1</i> expression status had significantly worse overall survival (HR = 3.2; 95%CI = (1.17-9); <i>p</i> = 0.024) compared to cases with low <i>MKX-AS1</i> expression status. Alternatively, high <i>MKX</i> expression status had significantly better overall survival (HR = 0.22; 95%CI = (0.07-0.7); <i>p</i> = 0.01) compared to cases with low <i>MKX</i> expression status. These results suggest an association between <i>MKX-AS1</i> and <i>MKX</i> expression status that could be useful as a prognostic marker of response to OXAL and potential patient outcomes in CRC.	296	306	CELL	cell lines	cell lines

Efavirenz (EFV) is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor commonly used as first-line therapy in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with a narrow therapeutic range and a high between-subject variability which can lead to central nervous system toxicity or therapeutic failure. To characterize the sources of variability and better predict EFV steady-state plasma concentrations, a population pharmacokinetic model was developed from 96 HIV-positive individuals, using a nonlinear mixed-effect method with Monolix® software. A one-compartment with first-order absorption and elimination model adequately described the data. To explain between-subject variability, demographic characteristics, biochemical parameters, hepatitis C virus-HIV coinfection, and genetic polymorphisms were tested. A combination of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs2279343 and rs3745274, both in the CYP2B6 gene, were the only covariates influencing clearance, included in the final model. Oral clearance was estimated to be 19.6 L/h, 14.15 L/h, and 6.08 L/h for wild-type, heterozygous mutated and homozygous mutated individuals, respectively. These results are in accordance with the current knowledge of EFV metabolism and also suggest that in homozygous mutated individuals, a dose adjustment is necessary. Hepatitis C virus-HIV coinfection does not seem to be a predictive indicator of EFV pharmacokinetic disposition.	248	270	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system	central nervous system

The 21st century has witnessed the discovery of multiple rare and common gene variants associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and these discoveries have already provided a starting point for the investigation of the biology of the disorder and novel treatments. The purpose of this selective review is to examine genetic findings from the past 5 years and consider their implications for the conceptualization of ADHD and future clinical practice. Recent discoveries reveal the strong genetic overlaps between ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as intellectual disability. Thus, the removal of the previous diagnostic exclusion criteria for ADHD in the presence of ASD is a welcome change in DSM-5. However, ADHD also shows substantial genetic correlations with a much broader group of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as with nonpsychiatric conditions (e.g., lung cancer). Investigating potential explanations for these links is an important next step. ADHD, while usefully conceptualized as a disorder in clinical practice, can be viewed as a trait. Recent genome-wide association study findings, consistent with twin studies, highlight that ADHD lies at the extreme end of a continuously distributed dimension, akin to hypertension along the continuum of blood pressure. Although ADHD levels typically decline with age, twin and molecular genetic studies suggest that a persistent trajectory is associated with higher genetic loading. Routine testing for rare mutations in ADHD is not yet recommended, although guidelines in many countries recommend testing individuals with mild intellectual disability or ASD, so practice could change. Common gene variants for ADHD are only weakly predictive and therefore have limited clinical value at present, as does pharmacogenomics.

Although immunosuppressive treatments and target concentration intervention (TCI) have significantly contributed to the success of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), there is currently no consensus on the best immunosuppressive strategies. Compared with solid organ transplantation, alloHCT is unique because of the potential for bidirectional reactions (i.e. host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host). Postgraft immunosuppression typically includes a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) and a short course of methotrexate after high-dose myeloablative conditioning, or a calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil after reduced-intensity conditioning. There are evolving roles for the antithymyocyte globulins (ATGs) and sirolimus as postgraft immunosuppression. A review of the pharmacokinetics and TCI of the main postgraft immunosuppressants is presented in this two-part review. All immunosuppressants are characterized by large intra- and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability and by narrow therapeutic indices. It is essential to understand immunosuppressants' pharmacokinetic properties and how to use them for individualized treatment incorporating TCI to improve outcomes. TCI, which is mandatory for the calcineurin inhibitors and sirolimus, has become an integral part of postgraft immunosuppression. TCI is usually based on trough concentration monitoring, but other approaches include measurement of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) over the dosing interval or limited sampling schedules with maximum a posteriori Bayesian personalization approaches. Interpretation of pharmacodynamic results is hindered by the prevalence of studies enrolling only a small number of patients, variability in the allogeneic graft source and variability in postgraft immunosuppression. Given the curative potential of alloHCT, the pharmacodynamics of these immunosuppressants deserves to be explored in depth. Development of sophisticated systems pharmacology models and improved TCI tools are needed to accurately evaluate patients' exposure to drugs in general and to immunosuppressants in particular. Sequential studies, first without and then with TCI, should be conducted to validate the clinical benefit of TCI in homogenous populations; randomized trials are not feasible, because there are higher-priority research questions in alloHCT. In Part I of this article, we review the alloHCT process to facilitate optimal design of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies. We also review the pharmacokinetics and TCI of calcineurin inhibitors and methotrexate.	142	161	CELL	haematopoietic cell	haematopoietic cell

It is essential to understand immunosuppressants' pharmacokinetic properties and how to use them for individualized treatment incorporating TCI to improve outcomes. TCI, which is mandatory for the calcineurin inhibitors and sirolimus, has become an integral part of postgraft immunosuppression. TCI is usually based on trough concentration monitoring, but other approaches include measurement of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) over the dosing interval or limited sampling schedules with maximum a posteriori Bayesian personalization approaches. Interpretation of pharmacodynamic results is hindered by the prevalence of studies enrolling only a small number of patients, variability in the allogeneic graft source and variability in postgraft immunosuppression. Given the curative potential of alloHCT, the pharmacodynamics of these immunosuppressants deserves to be explored in depth. Development of sophisticated systems pharmacology models and improved TCI tools are needed to accurately evaluate patients' exposure to drugs in general and to immunosuppressants in particular. Sequential studies, first without and then with TCI, should be conducted to validate the clinical benefit of TCI in homogenous populations; randomized trials are not feasible, because there are higher-priority research questions in alloHCT. In Part I of this article, we review the alloHCT process to facilitate optimal design of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics studies. We also review the pharmacokinetics and TCI of calcineurin inhibitors and methotrexate.	1786	1791	TISSUE	graft	graft
<b>Background:</b> The presence of polymorphisms in the <i>TPMT</i> gene is associated with adverse effects in patients treated with standard doses of thiopurine drugs. Scientific evidence recognizes significant ethnic differences in their frequencies and how their early identification can prevent clinical complications. <b>Methods:</b> 150 healthy residents of Aragua, Venezuela were enrolled. The SNPs c.460G>A and c.719A>G were detected by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay and c.238G>C by allele-specific PCR. <b>Results:</b> All genotype polymorphisms were heterozygous. <i>TPMT*1/*3A</i>, <i>TPMT*1/*3C</i> and <i>TPMT*1/*2</i> genotypes were found in 4.0, 2.0 and 0.7%, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> 6.7% of individuals have an intermediate TPMT activity. These findings support the importance of prior genotyping of <i>TPMT</i> in Venezuelan patients who require thiopurine drug therapy.	1	2	CELL	b	b

Data variability is a costly complication of biomedical experimentation because the same experiment must be repeated a sufficient number of times so that the sample mean becomes a credible representation of the entire population. Since sampling is ideally done randomly in populations normalized for environmental and genetic backgrounds, data variability is viewed as a purely statistical issue reflecting the distribution in the population and captured as the standard deviation of the sampled data. The factors contributing to data variability are not analyzed by statistical methods; for want of a better explanation, data scatter is simply attributed to random noise and/or methodological limitations. In this commentary, evidence is discussed that documents an important role of interindividual biological diversity as a cause for data variability based on studies in which repeated sampling in the same individual permitted statistical comparisons between individuals in the same sample. Significant differences were found for proximal fluid reabsorption and plasma renin concentration between sample means of individuals of the same population. Furthermore, arterial blood pressure varied significantly between individual mice independently of strain and sex. Recognition of the extent of interindividual variability has important implications for data reproducibility, data collection, and data presentation in physiological research. Such nonrandom data variability may have different causes, but DNA modifications by genetic or epigenetic mechanisms could generate phenotype variants without being associated with disease symptoms. Exploration of the heritability of phenotypical diversity in physiology may be defined as "physiogenetics," and it would thus be the physiological corollary of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics.	1066	1078	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma renin	plasma renin

Large-scale perturbation databases, such as Connectivity Map (CMap) or Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), provide enormous opportunities for computational pharmacogenomics and drug design. A reason for this is that in contrast to classical pharmacology focusing at one target at a time, the transcriptomics profiles provided by CMap and LINCS open the door for systems biology approaches on the pathway and network level. In this article, we provide a review of recent developments in computational pharmacogenomics with respect to CMap and LINCS and related applications.	107	115	CELL	Cellular	Cellular
In an effort to prevent potentially fatal adverse reactions to carbamazepine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert in 2007 containing pharmacogenomic information, which is still in effect today. The alert states that carbamazepine-induced skin reactions are significantly more common in patients with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*1502 allele and that these people are almost exclusively from 'broad areas of Asia, including South Asian Indians.' This study reviews the medical evidence relied upon by the FDA and finds that the alert does not accurately reflect the medical evidence relied upon in 2007 or evidence that has been generated over the last 5 years since the label was created. The FDA drug labeling should be modified to reflect current medical evidence.	260	264	ORGAN	skin	skin
Sensory systems sequentially extract increasingly complex features. ON and OFF pathways, for example, encode increases or decreases of a stimulus from a common input. This ON/OFF pathway split is thought to occur at individual synaptic connections through a sign-inverting synapse in one of the pathways. Here, we show that ON selectivity is a multisynaptic process in the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system. A pharmacogenetics approach demonstrates that both glutamatergic inhibition through GluClα and GABAergic inhibition through Rdl mediate ON responses. Although neurons postsynaptic to the glutamatergic ON pathway input L1 lose all responses in <i>GluClα</i> mutants, they are resistant to a cell-type-specific loss of <i>GluClα</i>. This shows that ON selectivity is distributed across multiple synapses, and raises the possibility that cell-type-specific manipulations might reveal similar strategies in other sensory systems. Thus, sensory coding is more distributed than predicted by simple circuit motifs, allowing for robust neural processing.	227	235	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	synaptic	synaptic

Personalized medicine is a set of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches in which medical interventions are carried out based on individual patient characteristics. As life expectancy increases in developed and developing countries, the incidence of diseases such as cancer goes up among people in the community. Cancer is a disease that the response to treatment varies from one person to another and also it is costly for individuals, families, and society. Among thyroid cancers, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is the most aggressive, lethal and unresponsive form of the disease. Unfortunately, current drugs are not targetable, and therefore they have restricted role in ATC treatment. Consequently, mortality of this cancer, despite advances in the field of diagnosis and treatment, is one of the most important challenges in medicine. Cellular, molecular and genetic evidences play an important role in finding more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Review of these evidences confirms the application of personalized medicine in cancer treatment including ATC. A growing body of evidence has elucidated that cellular and molecular mechanisms of cancer would pave the way for defining new biomarkers for targeted therapy, taking into account individual differences. It should be noted that this approach requires further progress in the fields of basic sciences, pharmacogenetics and drug design. An overview of the most important aspects in individualized anaplastic thyroid cancer treatment will be discussed in this review.	856	864	CELL	Cellular	Cellular

Fear behavior is under tight control of the prefrontal cortex, but the underlying microcircuit mechanism remains elusive. In particular, it is unclear how distinct subtypes of inhibitory interneurons (INs) within prefrontal cortex interact and contribute to fear expression. We employed a social fear conditioning paradigm and induced robust social fear in mice. We found that social fear is characterized by activation of dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and is largely diminished by dmPFC inactivation. With a combination of in vivo electrophysiological recordings and fiber photometry together with cell-type-specific pharmacogenetics, we further demonstrated that somatostatin (SST) INs suppressed parvalbumin (PV) INs and disinhibited pyramidal cells and consequently enhanced dmPFC output to mediate social fear responses. These results reveal a previously unknown disinhibitory microcircuit in prefrontal cortex through interactions between IN subtypes and suggest that SST INs-mediated disinhibition represents an important circuit mechanism in gating social fear behavior.	187	199	CELL	interneurons	interneurons

TNFalpha is a proinflammatory cytokine, which is crucial in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In recent years, biological therapies which block the damaging effects of TNFalpha on synovium and cartilage have been developed. TNF antagonists, such as etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab, although highly effective in RA, are expensive, totaling several thousand US dollars in yearly costs. In addition, only approximately 60% of patients respond to these agents. This has led to the need to prospectively identify patients most likely to respond to these agents, which can be achieved by pharmacogenomics approaches. Polymorphisms in genes encoding for TNFalpha, the MHC region, and the Fcgamma receptor IIIA, as well as their ability to predict disease progression in RA and response to anti-TNF therapies, have been the focus of a number of studies, which are discussed in this review. There is no consensus at present as to whether pharmacogenomics will allow prediction of anti-TNF therapy efficacy in RA. Large, prospective, multicenter studies are needed to replicate and validate the results of the studies outlined in this review.	193	201	CELL	synovium	synovium

Increased awareness of the cardiovascular toxic effects of chemotherapy has led to the emergence of cardio-oncology (or onco-cardiology), which focuses on screening, monitoring and treatment of patients with cardiovascular dysfunctions resulting from chemotherapy. Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, and HER2 inhibitors, such as trastuzumab, both have cardiotoxic effects. The biological rationale, mechanisms of action and cardiotoxicity profiles of these two classes of drugs, however, are completely different, suggesting that cardiotoxic effects can occur in a range of different ways. Advances in genomics and proteomics have implicated several genomic variants and biological pathways that can influence the susceptibility to cardiotoxicity from these, and other drugs. Established pathways include multidrug resistance proteins, energy utilization pathways, oxidative stress, cytoskeletal regulation and apoptosis. Gene-expression profiles that have revealed perturbed pathways have vastly increased our knowledge of the complex processes involved in crosstalk between tumours and cardiac function. Utilization of mathematical and computational modelling can complement pharmacogenomics and improve individual patient outcomes. Such endeavours should enable identification of variations in cardiotoxicity, particularly in those patients who are at risk of not recovering, even with the institution of cardioprotective therapy. The application of systems biology holds substantial potential to advance our understanding of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.	27	41	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular	cardiovascular

Due to interindividual variability in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, traditional isoniazid fixed-dose regimens may lead to suboptimal or toxic isoniazid concentrations in the plasma of patients with tuberculosis, contributing to adverse drug reactions, therapeutic failure, or the development of drug resistance. Achieving precision therapy for isoniazid requires a multifaceted approach that could integrate various clinical and genomic factors to tailor the isoniazid dose to individual patient characteristics. This includes leveraging molecular diagnostics to perform the comprehensive profiling of host pharmacogenomics to determine how it affects isoniazid metabolism, such as its metabolism by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), and studying drug-resistant mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome for enabling targeted therapy selection. Several other molecular signatures identified from the host pharmacogenomics as well as other omics-based approaches such as gut microbiome, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic approaches have provided mechanistic explanations for isoniazid pharmacokinetic variability and/or adverse drug reactions and thereby may facilitate precision therapy of isoniazid, though further validations in larger and diverse populations with tuberculosis are required for clinical applications. Therapeutic drug monitoring and population pharmacokinetic approaches allow for the adjustment of isoniazid dosages based on patient-specific pharmacokinetic profiles, optimizing drug exposure while minimizing toxicity and the risk of resistance. Current evidence has shown that with the integration of the host pharmacogenomics-particularly NAT2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomics data along with isoniazid pharmacokinetic concentrations in the blood and patient factors such as anthropometric measurements, comorbidities, and type and timing of food administered-precision therapy approaches in isoniazid therapy can be tailored to the specific characteristics of both the host and the pathogen for improving tuberculosis treatment outcomes.	182	188	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma	plasma

Current evidence has shown that with the integration of the host pharmacogenomics-particularly NAT2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomics data along with isoniazid pharmacokinetic concentrations in the blood and patient factors such as anthropometric measurements, comorbidities, and type and timing of food administered-precision therapy approaches in isoniazid therapy can be tailored to the specific characteristics of both the host and the pathogen for improving tuberculosis treatment outcomes.	810	816	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome
Due to interindividual variability in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, traditional isoniazid fixed-dose regimens may lead to suboptimal or toxic isoniazid concentrations in the plasma of patients with tuberculosis, contributing to adverse drug reactions, therapeutic failure, or the development of drug resistance. Achieving precision therapy for isoniazid requires a multifaceted approach that could integrate various clinical and genomic factors to tailor the isoniazid dose to individual patient characteristics. This includes leveraging molecular diagnostics to perform the comprehensive profiling of host pharmacogenomics to determine how it affects isoniazid metabolism, such as its metabolism by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), and studying drug-resistant mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome for enabling targeted therapy selection.

<b>Aim:</b> To explore the effect of <i>CYP2D6*10</i> (100C > T) and <i>ADRB1</i> 1165 G > C polymorphisms on heart rate of post-PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) patients treated with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 756 inpatients with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets were selected and the genotypes of <i>CYP2D6*10</i> and <i>ADRB1</i> 1165G > C were detected in 319 patients using gene chip detection. The target heart rate was defined as a resting heart rate < 70 beats/min. Clinical data were collected. <b>Results:</b> A total of 319 inpatients were enrolled in the study. The mutant allele frequencies of <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>ADRB1</i> were 57.21 and 69.44%, respectively. Whatever the dose of metoprolol, the heart rates were lower in patients with homozygous mutation of <i>CYP2D6</i> than those with heterozygous mutation and wild-type (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, this effect was not seen between different genotypes of <i>ADRB1</i>. Logistic regression analysis showed that the dose of metoprolol and the genotypes of <i>CYP2D6</i> were predictors of heart rate <70 beats/min in these patients.

Trinidad & Tobago has the highest prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Caribbean and clopidogrel is a ubiquitously used treatment. Yet, the extent of genetically mediated clopidogrel resistance is unknown. To determine this, we investigated whether the association between CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 genetic variants and clopidogrel resistance holds, and calculated the frequencies of these in the Trinidadian CVD population.	48	62	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular	cardiovascular
Liraglutide is a long-acting human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue and an effective treatment for patients with metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. This review focuses on the mechanism of action of liraglutide as a well-known glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in patients with T2DM and obesity. The lower and the higher doses of GLP-1 RAs are used for glycaemic control in T2DM and in obesity respectively. GLP-1 RAs such as liraglutide enhance insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon release via the stimulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs). Liraglutide decreases hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients when prescribes as monotherapy or in combination with one or more antidiabetic drugs. Usually, it is well tolerated with minor hypoglycemia in combination therapy. Liraglutide reduces cardiovascular events and related risk factors including improvement of lipid profile and control of blood pressure. Accordingly, it can be cost-effective and may be a budget neutral medication option by considering its protective effect on the cardiovascular system in long-term use in the health care plan. In the near future, by pharmacogenomics approach, prediction of the highest patient's response with the lowest adverse drug reactions and also rationality of drug development will be possible. Liraglutide can be used as a desirable medicine for glycemic control and obesity. It shows extensive evidence based benefits in diabetes complications. In this narrative review, we have summarized and evaluated studies related to the role of liraglutide in clinical practice.	888	902	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular	cardiovascular

Rilpivirine (RPV), the latest nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor active against HIV-1, is prescribed in a standard dosage of 25 mg once a day in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The aim of this observational study was to characterize the RPV pharmacokinetic profile, to quantify interpatient variability, and to identify potential factors that could influence drug exposure. RPV concentration data were collected from HIV-infected patients as part of routine therapeutic drug monitoring performed in our center (Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology). A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with NONMEM by comparing various structural models. The influence of demographic and clinical covariates, as well as frequent genetic polymorphisms in 5 genes (CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*17, UGT1A1*28, and UGT1A4*2), on RPV elimination was explored. A total of 325 plasma concentration measurements were obtained from 249 HIV-positive patients. Plasma concentrations ranged from 12 to 255 ng/ml. A one-compartment model with zero-order absorption best characterized RPV pharmacokinetics. The average RPV clearance (CL) was 11.7 liters/h, the average volume of distribution was 401 liters, and the mean absorption time was 4 h. The interinterindividual variability (IIV) for CL was estimated to be 33%. None of the available demographic or genetic covariates showed any influence on RPV pharmacokinetics, but 29% of the patients were predicted to present minimal concentrations below the recently identified target cutoff value of 50 ng/ml. The variability in RPV pharmacokinetics appears to be lower than that for most other antiretroviral drugs. However, under the standard regimen of 25 mg daily, a significant number of patients might be underdosed. It remains to be investigated whether the underexposure has an impact on the development of resistance while patients are on maintenance therapy.	1186	1188	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	CL	CL

It remains to be investigated whether the underexposure has an impact on the development of resistance while patients are on maintenance therapy.	1345	1347	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	CL	CL
Rilpivirine (RPV), the latest nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor active against HIV-1, is prescribed in a standard dosage of 25 mg once a day in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The aim of this observational study was to characterize the RPV pharmacokinetic profile, to quantify interpatient variability, and to identify potential factors that could influence drug exposure. RPV concentration data were collected from HIV-infected patients as part of routine therapeutic drug monitoring performed in our center (Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology). A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with NONMEM by comparing various structural models. The influence of demographic and clinical covariates, as well as frequent genetic polymorphisms in 5 genes (CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*17, UGT1A1*28, and UGT1A4*2), on RPV elimination was explored. A total of 325 plasma concentration measurements were obtained from 249 HIV-positive patients. Plasma concentrations ranged from 12 to 255 ng/ml. A one-compartment model with zero-order absorption best characterized RPV pharmacokinetics. The average RPV clearance (CL) was 11.7 liters/h, the average volume of distribution was 401 liters, and the mean absorption time was 4 h. The interinterindividual variability (IIV) for CL was estimated to be 33%. None of the available demographic or genetic covariates showed any influence on RPV pharmacokinetics, but 29% of the patients were predicted to present minimal concentrations below the recently identified target cutoff value of 50 ng/ml. The variability in RPV pharmacokinetics appears to be lower than that for most other antiretroviral drugs. However, under the standard regimen of 25 mg daily, a significant number of patients might be underdosed. It remains to be investigated whether the underexposure has an impact on the development of resistance while patients are on maintenance therapy.	1812	1822	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	underdosed	underdosed
Although trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity is an important determinant to limit the use of this drug, the molecular mechanism of risk for this toxicity is not well understood. To identify genetic variants determining the risk of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, we carried out whole exome sequencing of germline DNA samples from 9 patients with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity, and conducted a case-control association study of 2258 genetic variants between 9 cases (with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity) and general Japanese population controls registered in the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD). The top variant which showed the lowest P-value in the screening study was rs139503277 in PHD Finger Protein 3 (P<sub>min</sub> = .00012, odds ratio [OR] = 51.23). To further validate the result of screening study, we carried out a replication study of 10 variants showing P<sub>min</sub> < .001 in the screening study using 234 independent patients treated with trastuzumab, including 10 cases and 224 controls (without trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity). In the replication study, we observed that three variants had an effect in the same direction as in the screening study (rs78272919 in exon 2 of Keratin 15, rs5762940 in exon 2 of zinc and ring finger 3, and rs139944387 in exon 44 of Eyes shut homologs [EYS]). A combined result of the screening and the replication studies suggested an association of a locus on chromosome 6q12 with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (rs139944387 in EYS, combined P<sub>min</sub> = .00056, OR = 13.73). This finding provides new insights into personalized trastuzumab therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancer.	316	319	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA

History suggests β agonists, the cognate ligand of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor, have been used as bronchodilators for around 5,000 years, and β agonists remain today the frontline treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The β agonists used clinically today are the products of significant expenditure and over 100 year's intensive research aimed at minimizing side effects and enhancing therapeutic usefulness. The respiratory physician now has a therapeutic toolbox of long acting β agonists to prophylactically manage bronchoconstriction, and short acting β agonists to relieve acute exacerbations. Despite constituting the cornerstone of asthma and COPD therapy, these drugs are not perfect; significant safety issues have led to a black box warning advising that long acting β agonists should not be used alone in patients with asthma. In addition there are a significant proportion of patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled. In this chapter we discuss the evolution of β agonist use and how the understanding of β agonist actions on their principal target tissue, airway smooth muscle, has led to greater understanding of how these drugs can be further modified and improved in the future. Research into the genetics of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor will also be discussed, as will the implications of individual DNA profiles on the clinical outcomes of β agonist use (pharmacogenetics). Finally we comment on what the future may hold for the use of β agonists in respiratory disease.	228	237	ORGAN	pulmonary	pulmonary

Multiple biological processes throughout development require intracellular vesicular trafficking, where the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein (SNAP) receptors) complex plays a major role. The core proteins forming the SNARE complex are SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein 25), VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein) and Syntaxins, besides its regulatory proteins, such as Synaptotagmin. Genes encoding these proteins (SNAP25, VAMP1, VAMP2, STX1A, SYT1 and SYT2) have been studied in relation to psychiatric disorders susceptibility. Here, we review physiological aspects of SNARE complex and genetic association results reported for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, both in children and adults, autism spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Moreover, we included findings from expression, pharmacogenetics and animal model studies regarding these clinical phenotypes. The overall scenario depicted here suggests that the SNARE complex may exert distinct roles throughout development, with age-specific effects of genetic variants in psychiatric disorders. Such perspective should be considered in future studies regarding SNARE complex genes.	61	84	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intracellular vesicular	intracellular vesicular
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are now an accepted and widely used first-line treatment for pediatric depression and anxiety. However, the data indicate that SSRI treatment achieves a clinical response in only 55-60% of children, and some may develop drug-induced suicidal behavior. Clinicians have no reliable tools to help them identify in advance those youths who are not likely to respond to an SSRI, or who are likely to develop SSRI-induced suicidality. Pharmacogenetic research attempts to identify genetic markers that are associated with response and side-effect profile. This review covers all the pharmacogenetic studies conducted as yet on pediatric samples and compares them with available data on adult samples. An emphasis is put on serotonergic genes such as the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and additional genes known to be active in the CNS.	873	876	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS	CNS
Pharmacogenetics is a study of possible mechanism by which an individual's response to drugs is genetically determined by variations in their DNA sequence. The aim of pharmacogenetics is to identify the optimal drug and dose for each individual based on their genetic constitution, i.e. to individualize drug treatment. This leads to achieving the maximal therapeutic response for each patient, while reducing adverse side effects of therapy and the cost of treatment. A centralized pharmacogenetics service was formed at the Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia (IORS) with the aim to provide a personalized approach to cancer treatment of Serbian patients.	142	145	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA
Oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) based on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; coumarin derivatives) is the current mainstay for the prevention and long-term treatment of a variety of thromboembolic disorders. Care of patients on OAT is challenging due to considerable variability in the response to a particular dose. This has been attributed to environmental, demographic, clinical and genetic variables. Individualized responses represent a major clinical challenge because patients may experience adverse health outcomes from bleeding or thrombosis as a result of over- or under-coagulation, respectively. Growing evidence indicates that up to 60% of the individual pharmacological response to coumarins might be due to genetic variables and affected by polymorphisms in the genes encoding two enzymes, namely, vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) and cytochrome P450 CYP2C9. Genetic testing has been proposed as a useful tool for allowing prediction of the dose response during initial anticoagulation therapy, to assess variability in dose maintenance and to identify warfarin 'resistance'. However, genetic testing is not a panacea. Limitations include the optimal composition of test panels, still largely unknown, information concerning inter-individual variability, lack of analytical and quality specifications, lack of comprehensive outcome analyses to enable assessment of cost-effectiveness, lack of universal agreement related to reliable dosing algorithms and other ethical and social issues. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of the pharmacogenetics of VKAs, as well as assessing potential advantages and limitations. Although it might be premature to recommend routine genetic testing, the future development and clinical validation of simple but comprehensive algorithms integrating the most informative gene polymorphisms (VKORC1 and CYP2C9) with some demographic information (age, race, body mass index) and clinical variables (comorbidities, drugs interference), and standardized dietary intake of vitamin K may provide a valuable tool in the care of patients on OAT with conventional VKAs. However, the ongoing development of new anticoagulant drugs targeting thrombin and factor X will introduce a paradigm shift in long-term anticoagulation therapy, so that consideration could be given to demise pharmacogenetics testing for VKAs.	0	18	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Oral anticoagulant	Oral anticoagulant
The holistic approach of personalized medicine, merging clinical and molecular characteristics to tailor the diagnostic and therapeutic path to each individual, is steadily spreading in clinical practice. Psychiatric disorders represent one of the most difficult diagnostic challenges, given their frequent mixed nature and intrinsic variability, as in bipolar disorders and depression. Patients misdiagnosed as depressed are often initially prescribed serotonergic antidepressants, a treatment that can exacerbate a previously unrecognized bipolar condition. Thanks to the use of the patient's genomic profile, it is possible to recognize such risk and at the same time characterize specific genetic assets specifically associated with bipolar spectrum disorder, as well as with the individual response to the various therapeutic options. This provides the basis for molecular diagnosis and the definition of pharmacogenomic profiles, thus guiding therapeutic choices and allowing a safer and more effective use of psychotropic drugs. Here, we report the pharmacogenomics state of the art in bipolar disorders and suggest an algorithm for therapeutic regimen choice.	453	465	DEVELOPING_ANATOMICAL_STRUCTURE	serotonergic	serotonergic
NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Patients with NSCLC are mostly treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, often in combination with radiation therapy. However, the development of chemo-resistance is a major hurdle limiting treatment success. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the genetic factors modulating chemoresistance to platinum chemotherapeutics and their association with clinical outcomes for NSCLC patients. We focus on candidate pathways responsible for drug influx and efflux, metabolism and detoxification, DNA damage repair, and other downstream cellular processes that modulate the effect of platinum-based therapy. We also discuss the application of pathway-based polygenic and genome-wide approaches in identifying genetic factors involved in NSCLC clinical outcomes. Overall, current studies have shown that the effects of each individual polymorphism on clinical outcomes are modest suggesting that a more comprehensive approach that incorporates polygenetic, phenotypic, epidemiologic and clinical variables will be necessary to predict prognosis for NSCLC patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapeutics.	573	576	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants' interindividual trough concentration variability affects efficacy and safety, especially in bleeding events. Rivaroxaban is metabolised via CYP3A4/5-, CYP2J2-, and CYP-independent mechanisms and is a substrate of two transporter proteins: ABCB1 (MDR1, P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (BCRP; breast-cancer-resistance protein). The polymorphisms of these genes may possibly affect the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban and, consequently, its safety profile. Rivaroxaban variability may be associated with age, liver and kidney function, concomitant illness and therapy, and pharmacogenetic predisposition. This case series is the first, to our knowledge, that presents multiple risk factors for rivaroxaban-related bleeding (RRB) including age, renal function, concomitant diseases, concomitant treatment, and pharmacogenetic data. It presents patients with RRB, along with their complete clinical and pharmacogenetic data, as well as an evaluation of possible risk factors for RRB. Thirteen patients were carriers of <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>ABCG2</i>, <i>CYP2J2</i>, and/or <i>CYP3A4</i>/5 gene polymorphisms. Possible drug-drug interactions with increased bleeding risk were identified in nine patients. Six patients had eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Our data suggest a possible role of multiple factors and their interactions in predicting RRB; however, they also indicate the need for further comprehensive multidisciplinary research to enable safer use of this product based on a personalised approach.	25	44	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants	oral anticoagulants

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are commonly used to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Endorsed by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and the European Society of Cardiology, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have displaced warfarin as the OAC of choice for both conditions, due to improved safety profiles, fewer drug-drug and drug-diet interactions, and lack of monitoring requirements. Despite their widespread use and improved safety over warfarin, DOAC-related bleeding remains a major concern for patients. DOACs have stable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics; however, variability in DOAC response is common and may be attributed to numerous factors, including patient-specific factors, concomitant medications, comorbid conditions, and genetics. Although DOAC randomized controlled trials included patients of varying ages and levels of kidney function, they failed to include patients of diverse ancestries. Additionally, current evidence to support DOAC pharmacogenetic associations have primarily been derived from European and Asian individuals. Given differences in genotype frequencies and disease burden among patients of different biogeographic groups, future research must engage diverse populations to assess and quantify the impact of predictors on DOAC response. Current under-representation of patients from diverse racial groups does not allow for proper generalization of the influence of clinical and genetic factors in relation to DOAC variability. Herein, we discuss factors affecting DOAC response, such as age, sex, weight, kidney function, drug interactions, and pharmacogenetics, while offering a new perspective on the need for further research including frequently excluded groups.	0	19	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Oral anticoagulants	Oral anticoagulants

The second portion will discuss specific active coagulation factor inhibitors, the new oral anticoagulants.	206	224	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral anticoagulant	oral anticoagulant
This article reviews current and future treatment practices concerning oral anticoagulants. In the second decade of the 21st millennium clinicians can finally treat thrombotic disease with long-awaited new oral anticoagulant medications. In addition, improvements have been made in managing warfarin, the traditional but far from obsolete medication. The first part of this review will cover current advances with warfarin treatment.

The nucleus accumbens is a critical mediator of depression-related outcomes to social defeat stress. Previous studies demonstrate distinct neuroplasticity adaptations in the two medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, those enriched in dopamine receptor D1 versus dopamine receptor D2, in reward and reinforcement leading to opposing roles for these MSNs in these behaviors. However, the distinct roles of nucleus accumbens MSN subtypes, in depression, remain poorly understood.	4	21	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	nucleus accumbens	nucleus accumbens

Behçet disease (BD) is an enigmatic inflammatory disorder with multisystemic complications which is endemic in some countries but can be seen in the entire world. Valid diagnostic criteria are available. The pathology is related to a specific perivasculitis with involvement of both arteries and veins of all sizes. Minor arterial and cardiac involvement is frequent in BD but is usually asymptomatic. In exceptional cases cardiac symptoms may be the 1st manifestation of BD. The prevalence of severe cardiac complications (cardio-Behçet) should be < 10%. An impressive therapeutic improvement has been achieved by using appropriate catheterization techniques, coronary and intra-arterial stents, colchicine, drug-response modifying drugs and immunotherapy but, still cardio-Behçet has a poor prognosis. Efforts are undertaken to improve morbidity and prognosis with the use of newer drugs. An important part of the complications in BD are related to the frequent thromboembolic complications and there is high possibility that newer oral anticoagulants will be superior to the classical anticoagulants presently used. Available biologic agents have already been frequently used and seem to have improved the prognosis, but efforts are undertaken to find newer biologic agents with better therapeutic performance and less side-effects. Summarizing as much as possible the effects of the presently used biotherapy in BD, interferon-alpha is effective against many ocular, genital and perhaps vascular manifestations, but its effectiveness is limited by frequent adverse-effects (even if not dangerous for the cardiovascular system). Infliximab is a valid option in the therapy of ocular and cutaneous manifestations but it is less convincing in the therapy of vascular manifestations in vascular- and neuro-Behçet; furthermore, side-effects, including severe cardiovascular complications, are seen in a minority of patients; perhaps worse, infliximab seems to loose efficacy in the long-term therapy, while pharmacogenetics and receptor polymorphism may explain the existence of non-responders and the occurrence of resistance. Adalimumab might be a promising alternative for infliximab and seems to exert a good effect in an eurysmatic and other vascular complications. However, we lack long-term studies. Other biologic agents have been used only in few cases and it is too early to say if they offer new therapeutic perspectives.	283	291	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	arteries	arteries

Genetic alterations in cancer can provide information for predicting a tumor's sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. But although such information is certainly useful, the relatively low frequency of mutations seen in many cancers limits the utility of pharmacogenomics in large numbers of cancer patients, necessitating consideration of other approaches. Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation are a hallmark of human cancers. Methylation of genes involved in DNA repair and maintaining genome integrity (e.g. MGMT, hMLH1, WRN, and FANCF), and cell-cycle checkpoint genes (e.g. CHFR and 14-3-3 sigma, CDK10, and p73), all reportedly influence the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting that DNA methylation could serve as a molecular marker for predicting the responsiveness of tumors to chemotherapy. However, the comprehensive study of pharmacoepigenomics awaits the advent of genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation using microarrays and next-generation sequencers.	384	387	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA

Methylation of genes involved in DNA repair and maintaining genome integrity (e.g. MGMT, hMLH1, WRN, and FANCF), and cell-cycle checkpoint genes (e.g. CHFR and 14-3-3 sigma, CDK10, and p73), all reportedly influence the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting that DNA methylation could serve as a molecular marker for predicting the responsiveness of tumors to chemotherapy. However, the comprehensive study of pharmacoepigenomics awaits the advent of genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation using microarrays and next-generation sequencers.	493	499	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome

The Santorini Conference on prospective biology, genomics and pharmacogenomics occurs every 2 years. On 30 September to 2nd October 2010, the fifth meeting in this series took place in Santorini, Greece. This conference has established a tradition of organizing a workshop each time to address the most recent developments and key issues in pharmacogenomics. This year, the workshop was chaired by Bryan Dechairo and Alain Huriez, and was titled 'Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine in clinical practice'.	4	13	ORGAN	Santorini	Santorini
Since the Human Genome Project, the evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of some medications has become partially connected to innate metabolic patterns. Thus, genes that encode receptors and enzymes could play different roles in metabolism, according to their polymorphisms. Especially in organ transplantation, some of the available medications used in immunosuppressive therapy have a narrow therapeutic index, affecting the individual response to these drugs. This review focuses on the polymorphism of genes that encode enzymes of the uridino-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family, responsible for the bioavailability of mycophenolic acid, the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), used as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation. The increasing literature data regarding the pharmacogenetics of UGT and MMF suggest that enzyme polymorphism can explain the factors which influence the occurrence of side effects in patients receiving MMF as drug transplant therapy.	296	301	ORGAN	organ	organ
Persons with type 2 diabetes born in the regions of famine exposures have disproportionally elevated risk of vision-threatening proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in adulthood. However, the underlying mechanisms are not known. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the plausible molecular factors underlying progression to PDR. To study the association of genetic variants with PDR under the intrauterine famine exposure, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were previously reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes, glucose, and pharmacogenetics. Analyses were performed in the population from northern Ukraine with a history of exposure to the Great Ukrainian Holodomor famine [the Diagnostic Optimization and Treatment of Diabetes and its Complications in the Chernihiv Region (DOLCE study), <i>n</i> = 3,583]. A validation of the top genetic findings was performed in the Hong Kong diabetes registry (HKDR, <i>n</i> = 730) with a history of famine as a consequence of the Japanese invasion during WWII. In DOLCE, the genetic risk for PDR was elevated for the variants in <i>ADRA2A</i>, <i>PCSK</i>9, and <i>CYP2C19*2</i> loci, but reduced at <i>PROX1</i> locus. The association of <i>ADRA2A</i> loci with the risk of advanced diabetic retinopathy in famine-exposed group was further replicated in HKDR. The exposure of embryonic retinal cells to starvation for glucose, mimicking the perinatal exposure to famine, resulted in sustained increased expression of <i>Adra2a</i> and <i>Pcsk9</i>, but decreased <i>Prox1</i>. The exposure to starvation exhibited a lasting inhibitory effects on neurite outgrowth, as determined by neurite length. In conclusion, a consistent genetic findings on the famine-linked risk of <i>ADRA2A</i> with PDR indicate that the nerves may likely to be responsible for communicating the effects of perinatal exposure to famine on the elevated risk of advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy in adults. These results suggest the possibility of utilizing neuroprotective drugs for the prevention and treatment of PDR.	406	418	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intrauterine	intrauterine

When mycophenolic acid (MPA) was originally marketed for immunosuppressive therapy, fixed doses were recommended by the manufacturer. Awareness of the potential for a more personalized dosing has led to development of methods to estimate MPA area under the curve based on the measurement of drug concentrations in only a few samples. This approach is feasible in the clinical routine and has proven successful in terms of correlation with outcome. However, the search for superior correlates has continued, and numerous studies in search of biomarkers that could better predict the perfect dosage for the individual patient have been published. As it was considered timely for an updated and comprehensive presentation of consensus on the status for personalized treatment with MPA, this report was prepared following an initiative from members of the International Association of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology (IATDMCT). Topics included are the criteria for analytics, methods to estimate exposure including pharmacometrics, the potential influence of pharmacogenetics, development of biomarkers, and the practical aspects of implementation of target concentration intervention. For selected topics with sufficient evidence, such as the application of limited sampling strategies for MPA area under the curve, graded recommendations on target ranges are presented. To provide a comprehensive review, this report also includes updates on the status of potential biomarkers including those which may be promising but with a low level of evidence. In view of the fact that there are very few new immunosuppressive drugs under development for the transplant field, it is likely that MPA will continue to be prescribed on a large scale in the upcoming years. Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects is relatively common, increasing the risk for late rejections, which may contribute to graft loss. Therefore, the continued search for innovative methods to better personalize MPA dosage is warranted.	1914	1919	TISSUE	graft	graft
Nephrotic syndrome is one of the most common glomerular disorders in childhood. Glucocorticoids have been the cornerstone of the treatment of childhood nephrotic syndrome for several decades, as the majority of children achieves complete remission after prednisone or prednisolone treatment. Currently, treatment guidelines for the first manifestation and relapse of nephrotic syndrome are mostly standardized, while large inter-individual variation is present in the clinical course of disease and side effects of glucocorticoid treatment. This review describes the mechanisms of glucocorticoid action and clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prednisone and prednisolone in nephrotic syndrome patients. However, these mechanisms do not account for the large inter-individual variability in the response to glucocorticoid treatment. Previous research has shown that genetic factors can have a major influence on the pharmacokinetic and dynamic profile of the individual patient. Therefore, pharmacogenetics may have a promising role in personalized medicine for patients with nephrotic syndrome. Currently, little is known about the impact of genetic polymorphisms on glucocorticoid response and steroid-related toxicities in children with nephrotic syndrome. Although the evidence is limited, the data summarized in this study do suggest a role for pharmacogenetics to improve individualization of glucocorticoid therapy. Therefore, studies in larger cohorts with nephrotic syndrome patients are necessary to draw final conclusions about the influence of genetic polymorphisms on the glucocorticoid response and steroid-related toxicities to ultimately implement pharmacogenetics in clinical practice.	45	55	TISSUE	glomerular	glomerular
Thiopurines such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine are antimetabolites that have been used for several decades in the treatment of several diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases. Additional anti-inflammatory properties of these thiopurines have been discovered in recent years. Thiopurine metabolism is complex due to the involvement of multiple enzymes, of which the activities are genetically determined and cell type dependent. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes encoding these enzymes have been correlated with altered activities and drug intolerance. Detailed implications of these will be reviewed. Over the years several methods of therapeutic drug monitoring have been developed in an attempt to relate thiopurine drug availability with efficacy and intolerance. In this respect, monitoring pharmacologically active 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations is most widely used. So far, however, the clinical usefulness of these methods is hampered by methodological limitations. Some drug interactions may optimize the metabolization of thiopurines and consequently increase its efficacy and decrease drug intolerance. This review focuses on the clinical relevance and usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring of thiopurines and provides suggestions to optimize thiopurine therapy in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.	189	194	ORGAN	bowel	bowel

The objective of this case report is to illustrate pharmacogenomics (PGx)-guided oxycodone treatment, given the conflicting data on the analgesic response from oxycodone in Cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs). PGx-guided therapy can help improve treatment outcomes. This case report describes a 58-year-old patient who was prescribed oxycodone for chronic pain management. The patient presented with a history of inadequate pain control despite analgesic treatment with oxycodone (morphine milliequivalent [MME] = 22.5). Pharmacogenetic testing revealed that the patient was a CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizer (PM), which may shed light on the observed lack of analgesic response to oxycodone. The clinical pharmacist recommended switching to an alternative opioid not metabolized via the CYP2D6 pathway. The patient was subsequently switched to hydromorphone (MME = 16), resulting in improved pain control and fewer side effects. The newer hydromorphone dose accounted for a 30% MME dose reduction. The patient's initial average and worst pain score were 7 and 9 out of 10, respectively, per the numeric rating scale (NRS). Upon follow-up with the patient in two weeks, her average and worst pain scores improved to 3 and 3.5 out of 10, respectively, per the NRS. Further PGx testing results led to an overall positive outcome, such as her willingness to participate in physical therapy as a result of improved pain scores. This case highlights the importance of considering individual variability in drug metabolism when prescribing medications, particularly opioids such as oxycodone, to ensure optimal therapeutic outcomes and minimize the risk of adverse events in CYP2D6 PMs.	865	868	CELL	MME	MME

<b>Background:</b> Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer seen in children worldwide and in the Middle East. Although there have been major advances in treatment approaches for childhood ALL, serious toxicities do occur but with significant inter-individual variability. The aim of this study is to measure the frequency of polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) disposition in a combined cohort of Middle Eastern Children with ALL, and evaluate whether these polymorphisms predict 6-MP intolerance and toxicity during ALL maintenance therapy. <b>Methods:</b> The study includes children treated for ALL on two treatment protocols from two cohorts; one from Lebanon (N = 136) and another from Kurdistan province of Iran (N = 74). Genotyping for the following six candidate genetic polymorphisms: <i>ITPA 94C > A</i> (rs1127354) and <i>IVS2+21A > C</i> (rs7270101), <i>TPMT*2 238G > C</i> (rs1800462), <i>TPMT*3B 460G > A</i> (rs1800460) and <i>*3C 719A > G</i> (rs1142345), and <i>NUDT15 415C > T</i> (rs116855232) was performed and analyzed in association with 6-MP dose intensity and toxicity. <b>Results:</b> As expected, <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i> variants were uncommon. As for <i>ITPA</i>, both polymorphisms were more common in the Lebanese as compared to the Kurdish cohort with a minor allele frequency of 0.05 for <i>94C > A</i> and 0.14 for <i>IVS2+21A > C</i> in the Lebanese only (N = 121), and of 0.01 for either <i>ITPA</i> polymorphism in Kurds. The most significant toxic effects were depicted with the <i>NUDT15</i> polymorphism with a median 6-MP dose intensity of 33.33%, followed by 46.65% for <i>TPMT*3A</i> polymorphism, followed by 65.33% for two <i>ITPA</i> risk allele carriers and 74% for one <i>ITPA</i> risk allele carriers, in comparison to a median of 100% for the homozygous wild type in the combined cohort (P < 0.001). In addition, the onset of febrile neutropenia was significantly higher in variant allele carriers in the combined cohorts. <b>Conclusions:</b> These data confirm the predictive role of <i>TPMT</i>, <i>NUDT15</i>, and <i>ITPA</i> in 6-MP intolerance in Middle Eastern children with ALL. Given the relatively high frequency of <i>ITPA</i> variants in our study and their significant association with 6-MP dose intensity, we recommend that physicians consider genotyping for <i>ITPA</i> variants in conjunction with <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i> prior to 6-MP therapy in these children.	1	2	CELL	b	b

Given the relatively high frequency of <i>ITPA</i> variants in our study and their significant association with 6-MP dose intensity, we recommend that physicians consider genotyping for <i>ITPA</i> variants in conjunction with <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i> prior to 6-MP therapy in these children.	1149	1150	CELL	b	b
<b>Background:</b> Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer seen in children worldwide and in the Middle East. Although there have been major advances in treatment approaches for childhood ALL, serious toxicities do occur but with significant inter-individual variability. The aim of this study is to measure the frequency of polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) disposition in a combined cohort of Middle Eastern Children with ALL, and evaluate whether these polymorphisms predict 6-MP intolerance and toxicity during ALL maintenance therapy. <b>Methods:</b> The study includes children treated for ALL on two treatment protocols from two cohorts; one from Lebanon (N = 136) and another from Kurdistan province of Iran (N = 74). Genotyping for the following six candidate genetic polymorphisms: <i>ITPA 94C > A</i> (rs1127354) and <i>IVS2+21A > C</i> (rs7270101), <i>TPMT*2 238G > C</i> (rs1800462), <i>TPMT*3B 460G > A</i> (rs1800460) and <i>*3C 719A > G</i> (rs1142345), and <i>NUDT15 415C > T</i> (rs116855232) was performed and analyzed in association with 6-MP dose intensity and toxicity. <b>Results:</b> As expected, <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i> variants were uncommon. As for <i>ITPA</i>, both polymorphisms were more common in the Lebanese as compared to the Kurdish cohort with a minor allele frequency of 0.05 for <i>94C > A</i> and 0.14 for <i>IVS2+21A > C</i> in the Lebanese only (N = 121), and of 0.01 for either <i>ITPA</i> polymorphism in Kurds. The most significant toxic effects were depicted with the <i>NUDT15</i> polymorphism with a median 6-MP dose intensity of 33.33%, followed by 46.65% for <i>TPMT*3A</i> polymorphism, followed by 65.33% for two <i>ITPA</i> risk allele carriers and 74% for one <i>ITPA</i> risk allele carriers, in comparison to a median of 100% for the homozygous wild type in the combined cohort (P < 0.001). In addition, the onset of febrile neutropenia was significantly higher in variant allele carriers in the combined cohorts. <b>Conclusions:</b> These data confirm the predictive role of <i>TPMT</i>, <i>NUDT15</i>, and <i>ITPA</i> in 6-MP intolerance in Middle Eastern children with ALL. Given the relatively high frequency of <i>ITPA</i> variants in our study and their significant association with 6-MP dose intensity, we recommend that physicians consider genotyping for <i>ITPA</i> variants in conjunction with <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i> prior to 6-MP therapy in these children.	2032	2033	CELL	b	b
The heritability of hypertension (HTN) is widely recognized and as a result, extensive studies ranging from genetic linkage analyses to genome-wide association studies are actively ongoing to elucidate the etiology of both monogenic and polygenic forms of HTN. Due to the complex nature of essential HTN, however, single genes affecting blood pressure (BP) variability remain difficult to isolate and identify and have rendered the development of single-gene targeted therapies challenging. The roles of other causative factors in modulating BP, such as gene-environment interactions and epigenetic factors, are increasingly being brought to the forefront. In this review, we discuss the various monogenic HTN syndromes and corresponding pathophysiologic mechanisms, the different methodologies employed in genetic studies of essential HTN, the mechanisms for epigenetic modulation of essential HTN, pharmacogenomics and HTN, and finally, recent advances in genetic studies of essential HTN in the pediatric population.	337	342	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood	blood
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as an important tool for discovering regions of the genome that harbor genetic variants that confer risk for different types of cancers. The success of GWAS in the last 3 years is due to the convergence of new technologies that can genotype hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphism markers together with comprehensive annotation of genetic variation. This approach has provided the opportunity to scan across the genome in a sufficiently large set of cases and controls without a set of prior hypotheses in search of susceptibility alleles with low effect sizes. Generally, the susceptibility alleles discovered thus far are common, namely, with a frequency in one or more population of >10% and each allele confers a small contribution to the overall risk for the disease. For nearly all regions conclusively identified by GWAS, the per allele effect sizes estimated are <1.3. Consequently, the findings of GWAS underscore the complex nature of cancer and have focused attention on a subset of the genetic variants that comprise the genomic architecture of each type of cancer, which already can differ substantially by the number of regions associated with specific types of cancer. For instance, in prostate cancer, there could be >30 distinct regions harboring common susceptibility alleles identified by GWAS, whereas in lung cancer, a disease strongly driven by exposure to tobacco products, so far, only three regions have been conclusively established. To date, >85 regions have been conclusively associated in over a dozen different cancers, yet no more than five regions have been associated with more than one distinct cancer type. GWAS are an important discovery tool that require extensive follow-up to map each region, investigate the biological mechanism underpinning the association and eventually test the optimal markers for assessing risk for a disease or its outcome, such as in pharmacogenomics, the study of the effect of genetic variation on pharmacological interventions. The success of GWAS has opened new horizons for exploration and highlighted the complex genomic architecture of disease susceptibility.	104	110	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome

Kidney transplantation requires lifelong immunosuppression with agents that prevent allograft rejection. Immunosuppressive regimens typically include a steroid, an immune modulator (eg, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or mycophenolate sodium), and a calcineurin inhibitor, either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Tacrolimus is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 in both the liver and small intestine. Drugs that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4, as well as inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4, can cause significant interactions with tacrolimus. A review of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus is important to enhance practitioners' understanding when using tacrolimus after kidney transplantation. It is also important to educate patients and their families about tacrolimus. Patients' adherence to this medication regimen is pivotal for allograft survival. A consistent and comprehensive approach to education and discharge teaching is a key component of adherence and the attainment of therapeutic drug levels. At Shands Jacksonville Transplant Center, discharge education and teaching tools aid the transplant professionals and facilitate patients' adherence. This in turn supports the goals of maintaining therapeutic serum levels of tacrolimus and improving renal allograft survival.	0	6	ORGAN	Kidney	Kidney

This study aimed to analyze associations between genetic variants and the occurrence of clinical outcomes in dabigatran, apixaban, and rivaroxaban users. This was a retrospective real-world study linking genotype data of three Finnish biobanks with national register data on drug dispensations and healthcare encounters. We investigated several single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the ABCG2, ABCB1, CES1, and CYP3A5 genes potentially associated with bleeding or thromboembolic events in direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) users based on earlier research. We used Cox regression models to compare the incidence of clinical outcomes between carriers and noncarriers of the SNVs or haplotypes. In total, 1,806 patients on apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban were studied. The ABCB1 c.3435C>T (p.Ile1145=, rs1045642) SNV (hazard ratio (HR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.18-0.98, P = 0.044) and 1236T-2677T-3435T (rs1128503-rs2032582-rs1045642) haplotype (HR 0.44, 95% CI, 0.20-0.95, P = 0.036) were associated with a reduced risk for thromboembolic outcomes, and the 1236C-2677G-3435C (HR 2.55, 95% CI, 1.03-6.36, P = 0.044) and 1236T-2677G-3435C (HR 5.88, 95% CI, 2.35-14.72, P < 0.001) haplotypes with an increased risk for thromboembolic outcomes in rivaroxaban users.

In advanced renal cell carcinoma, a transition of drug therapies from cytokines to molecular-targeted drugs and immune-oncology drugs provides more clinical benefits to patients, while adequate management is required for various and sometimes serious adverse events. At present, the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of many drugs and their effectiveness or adverse events has been elucidated, and therapeutic drug monitoring is being applied to some immunosuppressive, anti-epileptic and antibacterial drugs in daily clinical practice. Most of the molecular-targeted drugs used in patients with renal cell carcinoma are orally active, and are affected by absorption and disposition, which can be different for each individual. The monitoring of the circulating drug concentration could be beneficial to patients by providing information for the adjustment of drug dose and the maintenance of a therapeutic plasma concentration range. Genetic polymorphisms are known to be involved in pharmacokinetics, and cause individual differences in clinical efficacy and adverse events. Therefore, a more scientific strategy should be used in regard to the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with molecular-targeted drugs by accumulating evidence on pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics.	915	921	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma	plasma

Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs)(Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease) represent major problems of health in developed countries, with important psychosocial burden for families and high cost for the society. NDDs share some common pathogenic mechanisms such as age-related decline, multiple genetic defects distributed across the genome, deposits of abnormal proteins in the brain, and diverse environmental risk factors. Patients with NDDs currently receive polypharmacy with a high risk for drug-drug interactions and severe adverse drug events. Pharmacogenomics accounts for 60-90% variability in drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Major determinants of the pharmacogenomic outcome include pathogenic, mechanistic, metabolic, transporter and pleiotropic genes. The expression of these genes is under regulatory control of the epigenetic machinery. Approximately, 80% of the Caucasian population is deficient in the metabolization of drugs due to polymorphisms in metabolic genes; consequently, less than 40% of patients respond appropriately to conventional drugs. The implementation of pharmacogenomic procedures in the clinical practice may help to optimize therapeutics in NDDs.	382	387	ORGAN	brain	brain

Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) encoded by orosomucoid genes (ORM1 and ORM2) is an acute-phase response protein and functions as a drug-binding protein that affects pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics of binding drugs. To explore the effects of genetic variations of ORMs and a role of AGP on paclitaxel (PTX) therapy, we analyzed the duplication and genetic variations/haplotypes of ORMs in 165 Japanese cancer patients and then investigated their associations with serum AGP levels and the PK parameters of PTX. No effects of ORM duplications on serum AGP levels at baseline or PK of PTX were observed, but close associations of ORM1 -559T > A with the increases of AGP levels and area under the curve (AUC) of PTX metabolites were detected. In addition, a significant correlation between the serum AGP level and the AUCs of PTX metabolites was observed, suggesting that AGP may function as a carrier of PTX from the blood into the liver via putative receptors. This study provided useful information on the possible clinical importance of ORM genetic polymorphisms and a novel role of AGP in PTX therapy.	470	479	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum AGP	serum AGP

Thiazide (TZD) diuretics are among the most commonly prescribed antihypertensives globally; however their chronic blood pressure (BP) lowering mechanism remains unclear. Herein we discuss the current evidence regarding specific mechanisms regulating the antihypertensive effects of TZDs, suggesting that TZDs act via multiple complex and interacting mechanisms, including natriuresis with short term use and direct vasodilatory effects chronically. Additionally, we review pharmacogenomics signals that have been associated with TZDs BP-response in several cohorts (i.e. NEDD4L, PRKCA, EDNRA-GNAS, and YEATS4) and discuss how these genes might be related to TZD BP-response mechanism. Understanding the association between these genes and TZD BP mechanism might facilitate the development of new drugs and therapeutic approaches based on a deeper understanding of the determinants of BP-response.	114	119	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood	blood
Displaying the highest level of diversity of any functional genetic complex with medical impact, the HLA system represents a landmark and a model for the development of predictive and preventive medicine.

Systems biology approach and integrative methodologies will undoubtedly be needed to unravel the ever growing number of HLA and diseases associations and the role of immunogenetics in transplantation and other allogeneic cell therapies. Also HLA, immunogenetics and pharmacogenetics are merging to bring to the individual patient tailored and personalized treatment. Providing insights into the complexities of predictive, preventive participatory and personalized medicine, the role of the HLA system will be consolidated at the forefront of the newer medicine.	607	611	CELL	cell	cell

Organic cation transporters (OCTs) of the solute carrier family (SLC) 22 are the subject of intensive research because they mediate the transport of many clinically-relevant drugs such as the antidiabetic agent metformin, the opioid tramadol, and the antimigraine agent sumatriptan. OCT1 (SLC22A1) and OCT2 (SLC22A2) are highly expressed in human liver and kidney, respectively, while OCT3 (SLC22A3) shows a broader tissue distribution. As suggested from studies using knockout mice, particularly OCT2 and OCT3 appear to be of relevance for brain physiological function and drug response. The knowledge of genetic factors and epigenetic modifications affecting function and expression of OCTs is important for a better understanding of disease mechanisms and for personalized treatment of patients. This review briefly summarizes the impact of genetic variants and epigenetic regulation of OCTs in general. A comprehensive overview is given on the consequences of OCT2 and OCT3 knockout in mice and the implications of genetic OCT2 and OCT3 variants on central nervous system function in humans.	357	363	ORGAN	kidney	kidney

Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, and in spite of extensive ongoing research, we neither fully understand its etiopathological background, nor do we possess sufficient pharmacotherapeutic tools to provide remission for all patients. Depression is a heterogenous phenomenon both in its manifestation and its biochemical and genetic background with multiple systems involved. Similarly, the employed pharmaceutical agents in the treatment of depression also effect multiple neurotransmitter systems in the brain. However, we do not yet possess sufficient tools to be able to choose the medication that treats the symptoms most effectively while contributing to minimal side effects in parallel and thus provide personalized pharmacotherapy for depression. In the present paper we review genetic polymorphisms that may be involved in the therapeutic effects and side effects of antidepressive medications and which, in the future, may guide customized selection of the pharmacotherapeutic regimen in case of each patient.	548	553	ORGAN	brain	brain
Hereditary or developmental neurological disorders (HNDs or DNDs) affect the quality of life and contribute to the high mortality rates among neonates. Most HNDs are incurable, and the search for new and effective treatments is hampered by challenges peculiar to the human brain, which is guarded by the near-impervious blood-brain barrier. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR), a gene-editing tool repurposed from bacterial defense systems against viruses, has been touted by some as a panacea for genetic diseases. CRISPR has expedited the research into HNDs, enabling the generation of <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models to simulate the changes in human physiology caused by genetic variation. In this review, we describe the basic principles and workings of CRISPR and the modifications that have been made to broaden its applications. Then, we review important CRISPR-based studies that have opened new doors to the treatment of HNDs such as fragile X syndrome and Down syndrome. We also discuss how CRISPR can be used to generate research models to examine the effects of genetic variation and caffeine therapy on the developing brain. Several drawbacks of CRISPR may preclude its use at the clinics, particularly the vulnerability of neuronal cells to the adverse effect of gene editing, and the inefficiency of CRISPR delivery into the brain. In concluding the review, we offer some suggestions for enhancing the gene-editing efficacy of CRISPR and how it may be morphed into safe and effective therapy for HNDs and other brain disorders.	1171	1176	ORGAN	brain	brain

In recent years, the genomics community has witnessed the growth of large research biobanks, which collect DNA samples for research purposes. Depending on how and where the samples are genotyped, biobanks also offer the potential opportunity to return actionable genomic results to the clinical setting. We developed a preemptive clinical pharmacogenomic implementation initiative via a health system-wide research biobank at the University of Colorado. Here, we describe how preemptive return of clinical pharmacogenomic results via a research biobank is feasible, particularly when coupled with strong institutional support to maximize the impact and efficiency of biobank resources, a multidisciplinary implementation team, automated clinical decision support tools, and proactive strategies to engage stakeholders early in the clinical decision support tool development process.	107	110	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA
Two independent lines of High Drinking in the Dark (HDID-1, HDID-2) mice have been bred to reach high blood alcohol levels after a short period of binge-like ethanol drinking. Male mice of both lines were shown to have reduced sensitivity to develop a taste aversion to a novel flavor conditioned by ethanol injections as compared with their unselected HS/NPT founder stock. We have subsequently developed inbred variants of each line. The current experiments established that reduced ethanol-conditioned taste aversion is also seen in the inbred variants, in both males and females. In other experiments, we asked whether HDID mice would ingest sufficient doses of ethanol to lead to a conditioned taste aversion upon retest. Different manipulations were used to elevate consumption of ethanol on initial exposure. Access to increased ethanol concentrations, to multiple tubes of ethanol, and fluid restriction to increase thirst motivation all enhanced initial drinking of ethanol. Each condition led to reduced intake the next day, consistent with a mild conditioned taste aversion. These experiments support the conclusion that one reason contributing to the willingness of HDID mice to drink to the point of intoxication is a genetic insensitivity to the aversive effects of ethanol.	102	115	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood alcohol	blood alcohol
Based on a broad public database compilation, we support the hypothesis that germinal polymorphisms may regulate the expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cellular target itself and proteases controlling the process of its shedding or, conversely, its internalization. Consequently, a genetic influence on individual susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is strongly suspected.	196	204	CELL	cellular	cellular
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) affect many patients and remain a major public health problem, as they are a common cause of morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that ADRs are responsible for about 6% of hospital admissions and about 9% of hospitalization costs. Skin is the organ that is most frequently involved in ADRs. Drug-induced skin injuries vary from mild maculopapular eruptions (MPE) to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) that are potentially life threatening. Genetic factors have been suggested to contribute to these SCARs, and most significant genetic associations have been identified in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. Common drugs associated with SCARs connected with strong genetic risk factors include antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), allopurinol, abacavir, nevirapine, sulfonamides, dapsone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and analgesic drugs. However, genetic associations vary between different ethnic populations. Differences may in part be explained by the different prevalence of HLA (human leukocyte antigen) alleles among ethnic groups. In this review, we present and discuss the recent advances in genetic associations with ADRs in the skin. Many of these ADRs are now preventable with pharmacogenetic screening.	265	269	ORGAN	Skin	Skin

Apixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant, a factor Xa inhibitor, used for the prevention of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Despite using recommended dosing a few patients might still experience bleeding or lack of efficacy that might be related to inappropriate drug exposure. We conducted a genome-wide association study using data from 1,325 participants in the pivotal phase three trial of apixaban with the aim to identify genetic factors affecting the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. A candidate gene analysis was also performed for pre-specified variants in <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>ABCG2</i>, <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>, and <i>SULT1A1</i>, with a subsequent analysis of all available polymorphisms within the candidate genes. Significant findings were further evaluated to assess a potential association with clinical outcome such as bleeding or thromboembolic events. No variant was consistently associated with an altered apixaban exposure on a genome-wide level. The candidate gene analyses showed a statistically significant association with a well-known variant in the drug transporter gene <i>ABCG2</i> (c.421G > T, rs2231142). Patients carrying this variant had a higher exposure to apixaban [area under the curve (AUC), beta = 151 (95% CI 59-243), <i>p</i> = 0.001]. On average, heterozygotes displayed a 5% increase of AUC and homozygotes a 17% increase of AUC, compared with homozygotes for the wild-type allele. Bleeding or thromboembolic events were not significantly associated with <i>ABCG2</i> rs2231142. This large genome-wide study demonstrates that genetic variation in the drug transporter gene <i>ABCG2</i> is associated with the pharmacokinetics of apixaban. However, the influence of this finding on drug exposure was small, and further studies are needed to better understand whether it is of relevance for ischemic and bleeding events.	21	39	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral anticoagulant	oral anticoagulant
Current strategies to treat type 2 diabetes (DMT2) include reducing insulin resistance using glitazones, supplementing with exogenous insulin, increasing endogenous insulin production with sulfonylureas and meglitinides, reducing hepatic glucose production through biguanides, and limiting postprandial glucose absorption with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. In all of these areas, new generations of molecules with improved efficacy and safety profiles, are being investigated. Promising biological targets are rapidly emerging such as the role of lipotoxicity as a cause of glucometabolic insulin resistance, leading to a host of new molecular drug targets such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators, recombinant adiponectin derivatives, and fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitors. Insulin action can be enhanced in muscle, liver and fat, with small-molecule activators of the insulin receptor or inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase (FTP)-IB. Defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by pancreatic B-cells could be alleviated with recombinant glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) or agonists to the GLP-1 receptor. This review presents a new approach for obesity and DMT2 drug discovery through pharmacogenomics. Several compounds have already been validated through genetic engineering in animal models or the preliminary use of therapeutic compounds in humans.	290	310	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	postprandial glucose	postprandial glucose

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Essential hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of other cardiovascular diseases and is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors, with up to 50% of blood pressure variance currently attributed to an individual's genetic makeup. By studying genes that cause monogenic forms of hypertension and pathways relevant to blood pressure control, a number of polymorphisms have been identified that increase an individual's risk of developing high blood pressure. We report on candidate gene association studies and genome-wide association studies that have been performed to date in the field of hypertension research. It is becoming clear that for the majority of people there is no single gene polymorphism that causes hypertension, but rather a number of common genetic variants, each having a small effect. Using pharmacogenomics to personalize the treatment of hypertension holds promise for achieving and sustaining normotensive pressures quickly, while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions and unwanted side-effects. This will decrease the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in individuals and lead to a reduced burden of disease upon society as a whole.	0	14	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	Cardiovascular	Cardiovascular

Pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing is commonly utilized to predict a patient's response to medications based on the presence of genetic variants. However, certain conditions have been associated with potentially inaccurate PGx results. The majority of medications are predominantly metabolized in the liver; therefore, in the case of liver transplantation, PGx results may be misinterpreted in the context of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Other instances of ambiguous PGx results have been reported in the literature in conditions such as allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute or chronic myeloid leukemia and blood transfusion. In order to prevent potential inaccuracies in PGx testing, Sanford Imagenetics developed an active, interruptive alert to inform providers of the potential for inaccurate PGx results.	297	302	ORGAN	liver	liver

The majority of medications are predominantly metabolized in the liver; therefore, in the case of liver transplantation, PGx results may be misinterpreted in the context of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Other instances of ambiguous PGx results have been reported in the literature in conditions such as allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute or chronic myeloid leukemia and blood transfusion. In order to prevent potential inaccuracies in PGx testing, Sanford Imagenetics developed an active, interruptive alert to inform providers of the potential for inaccurate PGx results.	556	567	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	bone marrow	bone marrow

In patients with invasive fungal infection (IFI), the steady-state serum trough concentration (<i>C</i> <sub>min</sub>) of voriconazole (VCZ) is highly variable and can lead to treatment failure (<i>C</i> <sub>min</sub> < 0.5 mg/L) and toxicity (<i>C</i> <sub>min</sub> ≥ 5.0 mg/L). However, It remains challenging to determine the ideal maintenance dose to achieve the desired <i>C</i> <sub>min</sub> level quickly.	67	72	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum	serum
Psoriasis is a prevalent chronic inflammatory condition that affects the skin. There are many treatments available for psoriasis but they are not universally effective and some have associated toxicities. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics explore the relationship between individual genetic variation and drug effect to allow targeted 'personalized' therapy for patients. There has been very limited pharmacogenetic research regarding psoriasis, with most limited to small retrospective case-control studies looking at single-nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes involved in drug pharmacokinetics. We review the pharmacogenetic investigation of treatments for psoriasis to date, including emerging pharmacogenomic studies. In addition, we discuss how such genetic data could be incorporated into routine clinical practice and future areas for development in this field.	73	77	ORGAN	skin	skin
<b>Introduction:</b> Atorvastatin exhibits wide interindividual variability in treatment response, limiting the drug efficacy in coronary artery disease patients. <b>Aim:</b> To study the effect of genetic variants involved in atorvastatin transport/metabolism and correlate their lipid-lowering efficacy. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Genotyping was performed using 5'-hydrolysis probe method (n = 412), and the study evaluated the treatment response in 86 patients. <b>Results:</b> Significant reduction in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were observed in <i>SLCO1B1</i>-rs4149056, rs4363657 and <i>ABCB1</i>-rs1045642 genotypes. The combined genotypes of <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>SLCO1B1</i> showed a strong synergistic effect in reducing the total cholesterol and LDL-C. Diabetes and smoking were observed to influence the LDL-C reduction. <b>Conclusion:</b> The genetic variants of <i>SLCO1B1</i> and <i>ABCB1</i> predict the lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin, and this may be useful in genotype-guided statin therapy for coronary artery disease patients.	1	2	CELL	b	b

Heterogeneity is the rule among pediatric heart transplant recipients. Patients vary in age, size, organ maturity, immune system maturity and underlying disease etiology, which can all influence post-transplant outcomes. Overall, the survival of pediatric transplant recipients continues to improve and the goal remains long-term survival of the primary graft and mitigation of long-term complications and adverse events. The evolving fields of pharmacogenomics and genomics have the potential to revolutionize and personalize the care of pediatric transplant recipients, and although clinical validation in a pediatric cohort is lacking, many of these technologies are becoming more readily available. We discuss genotype-guided dosing of immunosuppressant medications and other commonly used medications after transplantation, the influence of donor and recipient genotype on risk of post-transplant complications, genotype-guided selection of therapies to treat complications, and the use of next-generation sequencing for noninvasive detection of graft rejection.	42	47	ORGAN	heart	heart

The associations between plasma letrozole concentrations and CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genetic variants were tested in the Exemestane and Letrozole Pharmacogenomics (ELPH) trial. ELPH is a multicenter, open-label prospective clinical trial in women randomly assigned (n≈250 in each arm) to receive 2 years of treatment with either oral letrozole (2.5 mg/day) or oral exemestane (25 mg/day). CYP2A6 and CYP3A showed effects on letrozole metabolism in vitro. DNA samples were genotyped for variants in the CYP2A6 and CYP3A5 genes. Plasma letrozole concentrations showed high interpatient variability (>10-fold) and were associated significantly with CYP2A6 genotypes (P<0.0001), body mass index (BMI) (P<0.0001), and age (P=0.0035). However, CYP3A5 genotypes showed no association with plasma letrozole concentrations. These data suggest that CYP2A6 is the principal clearance mechanism for letrozole in vivo. CYP2A6 metabolic status, along with BMI and age, may serve as a biomarker of the efficacy of letrozole treatment or a predictor of adverse effects.	25	41	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma letrozole	plasma letrozole

Genetic polymorphisms or variations, randomly distributed in a population, may cause drug-gene response variations. Investigation into these polymorphisms may identify novel mechanisms contributing to a specific disease process. Such investigation necessitates the use of Mendelian randomization, an analytical method that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables for modifiable risk factors that affect population health.<sup>1</sup> In the past decade, advances in our understanding of genetic polymorphisms have enabled the identification of genetic variants in candidate genes that impact low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) regulating pathways and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. A specific candidate gene of interest is that of the LDL receptor degrading protein, PCSK9. In fact, loss-of-function genetic variants for the PCSK9 gene are what first highlighted this pathway as a candidate for pharmacologic inhibition. PCSK9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) are a class of cholesterol-lowering medications that provide significant reductions in LDL by inhibiting the degradation of LDL receptors (LDLR). These inhibitors have also been found to reduce production and enhance clearance of lipoprotein A (Lp[a]), an LDL-like particle currently under study as a separate risk factor for atherosclerotic CVD. Here, we discuss the promise of personalized medicine in developing a more efficacious and individualized pharmacogenomics-based approach for the use of PCSK9i that considers genetic variation and targets different patient populations. This review explores the pharmacogenomics of PCSK9i in the context of PCSK9 allele variants related to drug-metabolizing enzymes and responses since more studies are demonstrating that some patients are hyporesponsive or non-responsive to PCSK9i.<sup>2</sup> In summary, the pharmacogenomics of PCSK9 are a promising therapeutic target and genetic information from prospective randomized clinical trials is warranted to gain a full understanding of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of such allele and/or gene-guided PCSK9i therapy.	600	635	CELL	low-density lipoprotein cholesterol	low-density lipoprotein cholesterol

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is genetic autosomal recessive disease caused by reduced or absent function of CFTR protein. Treatments for patients with CF have primarily focused on the downstream end-organ consequences of defective CFTR. Since the discovery of the CFTR gene that causes CF in 1989 there have been tremendous advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of CF. This has recently led to the development of new CFTR mutation-specific targeted therapies for select patients with CF. This review will discuss the characteristics of the CFTR gene, the CFTR mutations that cause CF and the new mutation specific pharmacological treatments including gene therapy that are contributing to the dawning of a new era in cystic fibrosis care.	0	6	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Cystic	Cystic

This review will discuss the characteristics of the CFTR gene, the CFTR mutations that cause CF and the new mutation specific pharmacological treatments including gene therapy that are contributing to the dawning of a new era in cystic fibrosis care.	737	752	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	cystic fibrosis	cystic fibrosis
Analyses of polymorphisms in the renin-angiotensin system may never completely predict responsiveness to pharmacotherapy that blocks angiotensin-converting enzyme or the angiotensin receptor type 1. However, the pharmacogenetic studies that have been conducted to date are intriguing, and they illustrate the potential benefit of designing larger genome-wide clinical studies. Such studies will continue to define the role of renin-angiotensin pharmacogenetics in patients with heart failure due to underlying cardiac dysfunction.	478	483	ORGAN	heart	heart

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective controller medications for asthma, and variability in ICS response is associated with genetic variation. Despite ICS treatment, some patients with poor asthma control experience severe asthma exacerbations, defined as a hospitalization or emergency room visit. We hypothesized that some individuals may be at increased risk of asthma exacerbations, despite ICS use, due to genetic factors. A GWAS of 237,726 common, independent markers was conducted in 806 Caucasian asthmatic patients from two population-based biobanks: BioVU, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) in Tennessee (369 patients), and Personalized Medicine Research Project (PMRP) at the Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin (437 patients). Using a case-control study design, the association of each SNP locus with the outcome of asthma exacerbations (defined as asthma-related emergency department visits or hospitalizations concurrent with oral corticosteroid use), was evaluated for each population by logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age, gender and the first four principal components. A meta-analysis of the results was conducted. Validation of expression of selected candidate genes was determined by evaluating an independent microarray expression data set. Our study identified six novel SNPs associated with differential risk of asthma exacerbations (P < 10(-05)). The top GWAS result, rs2395672 in CMTR1, was associated with an increased risk of exacerbations in both populations (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.11; joint P = 2.3 × 10(-06)). Two SNPs (rs2395672 and rs279728) were associated with increased risk of exacerbations, while the remaining four SNPs (rs4271056, rs6467778, rs2691529, and rs9303988) were associated with decreased risk. Three SNPs (rs2395672, rs6467778, and rs2691529) were present in three genes: CMTR1, TRIM24 and MAGI2. The CMTR1 mRNA transcript was significantly differentially expressed in nasal lavage samples from asthmatics during acute exacerbations, suggesting potential involvement of this gene in the development of this phenotype. We show that genetic variability may contribute to asthma exacerbations in patients taking ICS. Furthermore, our studies implicate CMTR1 as a novel candidate gene with potential roles in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations.	963	982	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral corticosteroid	oral corticosteroid

Cantharis vesicatoria (blister beetle) is used in Chinese medicine and has been categorized as highly toxic in the Chinese pharmacopeia. In Europe, Cantharis patches have been used since ages to treat various skin-related diseases. We investigated the cytotoxicity of the Cantharis ingredient, cantharidin, in 41 tumor cell lines (Oncotest panel) and compared the results with those of 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute, USA. We found profound activity at low micromolar concentrations (log ₁₀IC₅₀ values between -6.980 and 5.009 M). Cantharidin bound to protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) with higher affinity (-8.12 kcal/mol) than to PP1 (-6.25 kcal/mol) in molecular docking analyses. Using a PCR array for 84 apoptosis genes, cantharidin treatment upregulated gene expression of caspase-1 and nerve growth factor receptor, but downregulated mRNA expression of Bcl-2 like protein 10, Fas ligand, and tumor necrosis factor-α. By using COMPARE analysis of microarray-based transcriptome-wide mRNA expressions, 21 genes were found to significantly correlate with response of 60 tumor cell lines to cantharidin. As shown by hierarchical cluster analysis and chi-squared test, the distribution of cell lines in the dendrogram according to their gene expression profiles predicted sensitivity or resistance to cantharidin (P=6.482 × 10(-5)). The compassionate use of Cantharis patches in two patients suffering from basalioma and Mycosis fungoides, respectively, considerably improved the diseases without signs of toxicity. In conclusion, these results indicate that cantharidin may be a useful candidate to develop novel strategies for cancer therapy.	0	21	CELL	Cantharis vesicatoria	Cantharis vesicatoria

Genetic variability related to the brain serotonergic system has a significant impact on both the susceptibility to psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), and the response to antidepressant drugs, such as fluoxetine. TPH2 is one of the most important serotonergic candidate genes in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) pharmacogenetic studies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of regulatory polymorphisms that are specifically located in human TPH2 transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), and therefore could be functional by altering gene expression, on clinical improvement in children and adolescents treated with fluoxetine. The selection of SNPs was also based on their linkage disequilibrium with TPH2 rs4570625, a genetic variant with questionable functionality, which was previously associated with clinical response in our pediatric population. A total of 83 children and adolescents were clinically evaluated 12weeks after initiating antidepressant treatment with fluoxetine for the first time. Clinical improvement was assessed by reductions in depressive symptoms measured using the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) scale. The polymorphisms rs11179002, rs60032326 and rs34517220 were, for the first time in the literature, significantly associated with higher clinical improvement. The strongest association was found for rs34517220. In particular, minor allele homozygotes showed higher score reductions on the CDI scale compared with the major allele carriers. Interestingly, this polymorphism is located in a human TPH2 TFBS for two relevant transcription factors in the serotoninergic neurons, Foxa1 and Foxa2, which together with the high level of significance found for this SNP, could indicate that rs34517220 is in fact the crucial functional genetic variant related to the fluoxetine response. These results provide new evidence for the role of regulatory genetic variants that could modulate human TPH2 expression in the SSRI antidepressant response.	35	53	ORGAN	brain serotonergic	brain serotonergic

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3-5 are polypharmacy patients. Many of these drugs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (<i>CYP450</i>) and <i>CYP450.</i> Genetic polymorphism is well known to result in altered drug metabolism capacity. This study determined the added value of pharmacogenetic testing to the routine medication evaluation in polypharmacy patients with CKD. In adult outpatient polypharmacy patients with CKD3-5 disease, a pharmacogenetic profile was determined. Then, automated medication surveillance for gene-drug interactions was performed based on the pharmacogenetic profile and the patients' current prescriptions. Of all identified gene-drug interactions, the hospital pharmacist and the treating nephrologist together assessed clinical relevance and necessity of a pharmacotherapeutic intervention. The primary endpoint of the study was the total number of applied pharmacotherapeutic interventions based on a relevant gene-drug interaction. A total of 61 patients were enrolled in the study. Medication surveillance resulted in a total of 66 gene-drug interactions, of which 26 (39%) were considered clinically relevant. This resulted in 26 applied pharmacotherapeutic interventions in 20 patients. Systematic pharmacogenetic testing enables pharmacotherapeutic interventions based on relevant gene-drug interactions. This study showed that pharmacogenetic testing adds to routine medication evaluation and could lead to optimized pharmacotherapy in CKD patients.	22	28	ORGAN	kidney	kidney
Voriconazole (VRC) overdoses are frequent and expose patients at high risk of adverse effects. This case-control study performed in hematological patients who benefited from VRC therapeutic drug monitoring from January 2012 to December 2015 aimed to identify risk factors of VRC overdose. Pharmacogenetic, biological, and demographic parameters at the time of VRC trough concentration (C<sub>min</sub> ) were retrospectively collected from medical records. Cases (VRC overdose: defined by a VRC C<sub>min</sub> ≥ 4 mg/L; n = 31) were compared to controls (no VRC overdose: defined by VRC C<sub>min</sub> < 4 mg/L; n = 31) using nonparametric or chi-square tests followed by multivariable analysis. VRC overdoses were significantly associated with high CRP and bilirubin levels, intravenous administration, and age in univariable analysis. In contrast, the proportion of CYP genotypes (CYP2C19, CYP3A4, or CYP3A5, considered alone or combined in a combined genetic score) were not significantly different between patients who experienced a VRC overdose and those who did not. In multivariable analysis, the class of CRP level (defined by median CRP levels of 96 mg/L) was the sole independent risk factor of VRC overdose (P < 0.01). Patients with CRP levels > 96 mg/L) had a 27-fold (IC 95%: [6-106]) higher risk of VRC overdose than patients with CRP levels ≤ 96 mg/L. This study demonstrates that inflammatory status, assessed by CRP levels, is the main risk factor of VRC overdose in French hematological patients, whereas pharmacogenetic determinants do not appear to be involved.	778	789	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous	intravenous
The nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR; 3-hydroxycotinine/cotinine) is an index of CYP2A6 activity. CYP2A6 is responsible for nicotine's metabolic inactivation and variation in the NMR/CYP2A6 is associated with several smoking behaviors. Our aim was to integrate established alleles and novel genome-wide association studies (GWAS) signals to create a weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) for the CYP2A6 gene for European-ancestry populations. The wGRS was compared with a previous CYP2A6 gene scoring approach designed for an alternative phenotype (C2/N2; cotinine-d2/(nicotine-d2 + cotinine-d2)). CYP2A6 genotypes and the NMR were assessed in European-ancestry participants. The wGRS training set included N = 933 smokers recruited to the Pharmacogenetics of Nicotine Addiction and Treatment clinical trial [NCT01314001]. The replication cohort included N = 196 smokers recruited to the Quit 2 Live clinical trial [NCT01836276]. Comparisons between the two CYP2A6 phenotypes and with fractional clearance were made in a laboratory-based pharmacokinetic study (N = 92 participants). In both the training and replication sets, the wGRS, which included seven CYP2A6 variants, explained 33.8% (P < 0.001) of the variance in NMR, providing improved predictive power to the NMR phenotype when compared with other CYP2A6 gene scoring approaches. NMR and C2/N2 were strongly correlated to nicotine clearance (ρ = 0.70 and ρ = 0.79, respectively; P < 0.001), and to one another (ρ = 0.82; P < 0.001); however reduced function genotypes occurred in slow NMR but throughout C2/N2. The wGRS was able to predict smoking quantity and nicotine intake, to discriminate between NMR slow and normal metabolizers (AUC = 0.79; P < 0.001), and to replicate previous NMR-stratified cessation outcomes showing unique treatment outcomes between metabolizer groups.	551	575	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	cotinine-d2/(nicotine-d2	cotinine-d2/(nicotine-d2
The immunogenetics research and clinical communities are undergoing a revolution in the way that Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) alleles are typed, thanks to the introduction and increasing acceptance of next-generation sequencing into laboratory practice. With the ability to sequence all exons of each allele, instead of the previously routine typing of exons 2 and 3 of class I and exon 2 of class II, the sequencing of previously unsequenced areas of HLA alleles is causing a host of new alleles to be discovered through the course of routine laboratory testing. In the first 4 months of routine next generation sequencing, we have identified 10 novel alleles that have been discovered through laboratory testing for all facets of HLA typing, i.e. solid organ transplantation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, disease association typing and pharmacogenomics testing. The advent of NGS HLA typing in routine clinical practice, and the concomitant routine typing of exons outside the norm, opens the window for rapid discovery of new HLA alleles and a potential for overwhelming the current HLA nomenclature naming conventions.	780	803	CELL	hematopoietic stem cell	hematopoietic stem cell
Regarding several cytotoxic agents, it was evidenced that genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes involved in their metabolism are associated with higher risk of toxicity. Genotyping these genes before treatment is a valuable strategy to prevent side effects and to predict individual response to drug therapy. This pharmacogenetic approach is recommended for chemotherapies such as thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, thioguanine), irinotecan, and fluoropyrimidines (capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil). In this study, we aimed at developing and validating a fast, cost-effective, and easily implementable multiplex genotyping method suitable for analyzing a panel of nine variants involved in the pharmacogenetics of widely prescribed anticancer drugs. We designed a multiplex-specific PCR assay where fragments were labeled by two different fluorescent dye markers (HEX/FAM) identifiable by fragment analysis. These two labels were used to discriminate bi-allelic variants, while the size of the fragment allowed the identification of a particular polymorphism location. Variants of interest were <i>TPMT</i> (rs1800462, rs1142345, rs1800460), <i>NUDT15</i> (rs116855232), <i>DPYD</i> (rs55886062, rs3918290, rs67376798, rs75017182), and <i>UGT1A1</i> (rs8175347). The assay was repeatable, and genotypes could be determined when DNA sample amounts ranged from 25 to 100 ng. Primers and dye remained stable in a ready-to-use mixture solution after five freeze-thaw cycles. Accuracy was evidenced by the consistency of 187 genotyping results obtained with our multiplex assay and a reference method. The developed method is fast and cost-effective in simultaneously identifying nine variants involved in the pharmacological response of anticancer drugs. This assay can be easily implemented in laboratories for widespread access to pharmacogenetics in clinical practice.	783	801	CELL	multiplex-specific	multiplex-specific

Pharmacogenomics addresses the impacts of diverse and multiple genes in populations as determinants of responses of individual patients to drugs. The field has its roots in basic science, and is pivotal in drug development, elucidation of therapeutic efficacy, and constraining the risks of adverse drug reactions. Regulatory agencies are relying increasingly on pharmacogenomics for identification of patients who are particularly likely to benefit from treatment with specific agents and exclusion of those at risk of adverse drug reactions. Practical applications of pharmacogenomics already abound particularly in the use of drugs acting on the central nervous system and on the cardiovascular system. The Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine (SEBM) is proud and pleased to have devoted its 2008 symposium, presented at the annual Experimental Biology meeting in San Diego on April 6, 2008, to advances in pharmacogenomics with emphasis on drug development, regulatory agency considerations, and clinical applications.	164	169	ORGAN	roots	roots

Cytochrome P450 enzymes play an important role in the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity of drugs. Age-dependent changes in P450 enzyme expression have been studied based on several detection systems, as well as by deconvolution of in vivo pharmacokinetic data observed in pediatric populations. The age-dependent changes in P450 enzyme expression can be important determinants of drug disposition in childhood, in addition to the changes in body size and the other physiological parameters, and effects of pharmacogenetics and disease on organ functions. As a tool incorporating drug-specific and body-specific factors, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have become increasingly used to characterize and explore mechanistic insights into drug disposition. Thus, PBPK models can be a bridge between findings from basic science and utilization in predictive science. Pediatric PBPK models incorporate additional system specific information on developmental physiology and ontogeny and have been used to predict pharmacokinetic parameters from preterm neonates onwards. These models have been advocated by regulatory authorities in order to support pediatric clinical trials.

World-wide, about 415 million people are suffering from T2DM with a projected rise to 642 million in 2040. T2DM is treated with several classes of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) viz. biguanides, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, etc. Treatment strategies for T2DM are to minimize long-term micro and macro vascular complications by achieving an optimized glycemic control. Genetic variations in the human genome not only disclose the risk of T2DM development but also predict the personalized response to drug therapy. Inter-individual variability in response to OADs is due to polymorphisms in genes encoding drug receptors, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes for example, genetic variants in solute carrier transporters (SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC22A3, SLC47A1 and SLC47A2) are actively involved in glycemic/HbA1c management of metformin. In addition, CYP gene encoding Cytochrome P450 enzymes also play a crucial role with respect to metabolism of drugs. Pharmacogenetic studies provide insights on the relationship between individual genetic variants and variable therapeutic outcomes of various OADs. Clinical utility of pharmacogenetic study is to predict the therapeutic dose of various OADs on individual basis. Pharmacogenetics therefore, is a step towards personalized medicine which will greatly improve the efficacy of diabetes treatment.	290	294	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral	oral

Warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant, but large interindividual variations exist in the dose required to achieve comparable therapeutic effects. Several clinical and genetic variables have been identified that influence warfarin dosing. However, interactions between genotype and nutrition remain uncertain in terms of dietary vitamin K intake. To investigate genotype-nutrient interactions in warfarin anticoagulation therapy, 202 consecutive outpatients (M/F = 142/60, mean age, 69 years) undergoing treatment with warfarin were enrolled. Prevalent single nucleotide polymorphisms in VKORC1 and CYP2C9 were genotyped, and dietary vitamin K intake during the week preceding the blood sampling was quantitatively estimated by a dietitian-assisted questionnaire. Patients were classified according to low, medium, or high vitamin K intake. The mean daily warfarin dose in subjects with a VKORC1-1639 A/A genotype was significantly smaller than that with a -1639A/G genotype (2.74 vs. 3.91 mg/day, respectively, p < 0.0001). Dose requirements did not differ between subjects with a CYP2C9 *1/*3 genotype versus a CYP2C9 *1/*1 genotype. In subjects with a variant VKORC1-1639 G allele, the mean daily warfarin dose was significantly attenuated by low vitamin K intake compared with medium and high intake after adjustment for covariates (3.4 vs. 5.0 vs. 4.0 mg/day, respectively, p = 0.028). No such genotype effects were observed in homozygous patients for the VKORC1-1639 A allele. The results of the present study suggest that the capacity of dietary vitamin K intake to influence warfarin dose requirements during anticoagulation therapy is VKORC1 genotype-dependent, at least in part.	39	57	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral anticoagulant	oral anticoagulant

Metformin is a first-line oral antidiabetic agent that has shown additional effects in treating obesity and metabolic syndrome. Inter-individual variability in metformin response could be partially explained by the genetic component. Here, we aimed to test whether common genetic variants can predict the response to metformin intervention in obese children. The study was a multicenter and double-blind randomized controlled trial that was stratified according to sex and pubertal status in 160 children with obesity. Children were randomly assigned to receive either metformin (1g/d) or placebo for six months after meeting the defined inclusion criteria. We conducted a post hoc genotyping study in 124 individuals (59 placebo, 65 treated) comprising finally 231 genetic variants in candidate genes. We provide evidence for 28 common variants as promising pharmacogenetics regulators of metformin response in terms of a wide range of anthropometric and biochemical outcomes, including body mass index (BMI) Z-score, and glucose, lipid, and inflammatory traits. Although no association remained statistically significant after multiple-test correction, our findings support previously reported variants in metformin transporters or targets as well as identify novel and promising loci, such as the <i>ADYC3</i> and the <i>BDNF</i> genes, with plausible biological relation to the metformin's action mechanism.

Pharmacogenetics has often been touted as a cornerstone for precision medicine as detailed knowledge of a specific genetic makeup may allow for accurate predictions of a patient's individual drug response. Still, the widespread use of genetic tests is limited as they remain expensive and cumbersome, requiring sophisticated tools and highly trained personnel. In order for pharmacogenetics to reach its full potential, more cost-effective and easily accessible genotyping methods are desired. To meet these challenges, we present a silicon-based integrated microsystem for the detection of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) directly from human blood. The device combines a blood lysis chamber, a cross-flow filter, a T-junction mixer, and a microreactor for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Using this device, successful on-chip genotyping of two clinically relevant SNPs in human CYP2C9 gene was demonstrated with TaqMan assays, starting from blood. The two SNPs were detected simultaneously by introducing a sequence of plugs, each containing a different set of primers and probes. The method can be easily extended to detect several SNPs. The microsystem described here offers a rapid, reproducible, and accurate sample-to-answer technology enabling multiplex SNP profiling in point-of-care settings, bringing pharmacogenetics-based precision medicine a step closer to reality.	688	693	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood	blood

The main advantage of a theoretical approach is essential knowledge of the mechanisms that allow us to comprehend the experimental conditions that we have to fulfill to be able to get the desired results. Based on our research in ultrathin crystal structures performed so far, superlattices, Q-wires and Q-dots, we will consider the materials that can act as carriers for medicines and tagged substances. For this purpose we established a shell-model of ultrathin crystals and investigated their fundamental characteristics. This could be considered as a form of nano-engineering. In this paper we will analyze application of nanomaterials in biomedicine, that is to say we will present the recent accomplishments in basic and clinical nanomedicine. Achieving full potential of nanomedicine may be years or even decades away, however, potential advances in drug delivery, diagnosis, and development of nanotechnology-related drugs start to change the landscape of medicine. Site-specific targeted drug delivery (made possible by the availability of unique delivery platforms, such as dendrimers, nanoparticles and nanoliposomes) and personalized medicines (result of the advance in pharmacogenetics) are just a few concepts on the horizon of research. In this paper, especially, we have analyzed the changes in basic physical properties of spherical-shaped nanoparticles that can be made in several (nano)layers and have, at the same time, multiple applications in medicine. This paper presents a review of our current achievement in the field of theoretical physics of ultrathin films and possible ways to materialize the same in the field of nanopharmacy.	1096	1109	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	nanoparticles	nanoparticles
Variations in disease onset and/or severity have often been observed in siblings with cystic fibrosis (CF), despite the same <i>CFTR</i> genotype and environment. We postulated that genomic variation (modifier and/or pharmacogenomic variants) might explain these clinical discordances. From a cohort of patients included in the Wisconsin randomized clinical trial (RCT) of newborn screening (NBS) for CF, we identified two brothers who showed discordant lung disease courses as children, with one milder and the other more severe than average, and a third, eldest brother, who also has severe lung disease. Leukocytes were harvested as the source of DNA, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed. Variants were identified and analyzed using in-house-developed informatics tools. Lung disease onset and severity were quantitatively different between brothers during childhood. The youngest, less severely affected brother is homozygous for <i>HFE</i> p.H63D. He also has a very rare <i>PLG</i> p.D238N variant that may influence host-pathogen interaction during chronic lung infection. Other variants of interest were found differentially between the siblings. Pharmacogenomics findings were consistent with the middle, most severely affected brother having poor outcomes to common CF treatments. We conclude that genomic variation between siblings with CF is expected. Variable lung disease severity may be associated with differences acting as genetic modifiers and/or pharmacogenomic factors, but large cohort studies are needed to assess this hypothesis.	86	92	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	cystic	cystic

<b>Background:</b> Publications on the associations of genetic variants with the response to platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) in NSCLC patients have surged over the years, but the results have been inconsistent. Here, a comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted to combine eligible studies for a more accurate assessment of the pharmacogenetics of PBC in NSCLC patients. <b>Methods:</b> Relevant publications were searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases through 15 May 2021. Inclusion criteria for eligible publications include studies that reported genotype and allele frequencies of NSCLC patients treated with PBC, delineated by their treatment response (sensitive vs. resistant). Publications on cell lines or animal models, duplicate reports, and non-primary research were excluded. Epidemiological credibility of cumulative evidence was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Venice criteria. Begg's and Egger's tests were used to assess publication bias. Cochran's Q-test and I<sup>2</sup> test were used to calculate the odds ratio and heterogeneity value to proceed with the random effects or fixed-effects method.

The field of pharmacogenomics seeks to identify the impact of genetic variants on drug dosing, response, metabolism, and safety outcomes. The narrow therapeutic indices for anesthesia drugs, variability of patient responses to anesthesia, and the risks associated with surgery make anesthetics and the perioperative period prime targets for pharmacogenetic research. Anesthesia providers strive to optimize anesthesia delivery and patient outcomes and to specifically reduce anesthesia-related risks and negative outcomes. Despite pharmacogenomics emerging from the field of anesthesia, the most significant advances to date in the understanding and application of genetics to pharmacology have occurred outside of anesthesiology. This chapter provides an overview of genetic concepts fundamental to understanding the pharmacogenetics of anesthesia practice and presents the current state of the science with respect to the genetic influence on the response to volatile and intravenous anesthetic agents and opioid receptor agonists commonly used in anesthesia practice. In addition, the chapter delineates U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling tenets for pharmacogenetics, discusses clinical implications of pharmacogenomics for family members, and highlights the potential for future paradigm shifts in pharmacogenomics of anesthesia practice.	974	985	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous	intravenous
Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a key enzyme in drug response owing to its involvement in the metabolism of ~ 25% of clinically prescribed medications. The encoding CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic, and many pharmacogenetics studies have been performed worldwide to investigate the distribution of CYP2D6 star alleles (haplotypes); however, African populations have been relatively understudied to date. In this study, the distributions of CYP2D6 star alleles and predicted drug metabolizer phenotypes-derived from activity scores-were examined across multiple sub-Saharan African populations based on bioinformatics analysis of 961 high-depth whole genome sequences. This was followed by characterization of novel star alleles and suballeles in a subset of the participants via targeted high-fidelity Single-Molecule Real-Time resequencing (Pacific Biosciences). This study revealed varying frequencies of known CYP2D6 alleles and predicted phenotypes across different African ethnolinguistic groups. Twenty-seven novel CYP2D6 star alleles were predicted computationally and two of them were further validated. This study highlights the importance of studying variation in key pharmacogenes such as CYP2D6 in the African context to better understand population-specific allele frequencies. This will aid in the development of better genotyping panels and star allele detection approaches with a view toward supporting effective implementation of precision medicine strategies in Africa and across the African diaspora.	651	657	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome
One strategy for understanding variability in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication response, and therefore redressing the current trial-and-error approach to ADHD medication management, is to identify genetic moderators of treatment. This article summarizes ADHD pharmacogenetic investigative efforts to date, which have primarily focused on short-term response to methylphenidate and largely been limited by modest sample sizes. The most well studied genes include the dopamine transporter and dopamine D(4) receptor, with additional genes that have been significantly associated with stimulant medication response including the adrenergic alpha(2A)-receptor, catechol-O-methyltransferase, D(5) receptor, noradrenaline (norepinephrine) transporter protein 1 and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa. Unfortunately, results of current ADHD pharmacogenetic studies have not been entirely consistent, possibly due to differences in study design, medication dosing regimens and outcome measures. Future directions for ADHD pharmacogenetics investigations may include examination of drug-metabolizing enzymes and a wider range of stimulant and non-stimulant medications. In addition, researchers are increasingly interested in going beyond the individual candidate gene approach to investigate gene-gene interactions or pathways, effect modification by additional environmental exposures and whole genome approaches. Advancements in ADHD pharmacogenetics will be facilitated by multi-site collaborations to obtain larger sample sizes using standardized protocols. Although ADHD pharmacogenetic efforts are still in a relatively early stage, their potential clinical applications may include the development of treatment efficacy and adverse effect prediction algorithms that incorporate the interplay of genetic and environmental factors, as well as the development of novel ADHD treatments.	1895	1899	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	ADHD	ADHD
The large-scale implementation of genomic medicine in Africa has not been actualized. This overview describes how routine molecular genetics and advanced protein engineering/structural biotechnology could accelerate the implementation of genomic medicine. By using data-mining and analysis approaches, we analyzed relevant information obtained from public genomic databases on pharmacogenomics biomarkers and reviewed published studies to discuss the ideas. The results showed that only 68 very important pharmacogenes currently exist, while 867 drug label annotations, 201 curated functional pathways, and 746 annotated drugs have been catalogued on the largest pharmacogenomics database (PharmGKB). Only about 5009 variants of the reported ∼25,000 have been clinically annotated. Predominantly, the genetic variants were derived from 43 genes that contribute to 2318 clinically relevant variations in 57 diseases. Majority (∼60%) of the clinically relevant genetic variations in the pharmacogenes are missense variants (1390). The enrichment analysis showed that 15 pharmacogenes are connected biologically and are involved in the metabolism of cardiovascular and cancer drugs. The review of studies showed that cardiovascular diseases are the most frequent non-communicable diseases responsible for approximately 13% of all deaths in Africa. Also, warfarin pharmacogenomics is the most studied drug on the continent, while CYP2D6, CYP2C9, DPD, and TPMT are the most investigated pharmacogenes with allele activities indicated in African and considered to be intermediate metaboliser for DPD and TPMT (8.4% and 11%). In summary, we highlighted a framework for implementing genomic medicine starting from the available resources on ground.	1214	1228	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular	cardiovascular
Genome-wide association studies have generally failed to identify polymorphisms associated with antidepressant response. Possible reasons include limited coverage of genetic variants that this study tried to address by exome genotyping and dense imputation. A meta-analysis of Genome-Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) and Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) studies was performed at the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), gene and pathway levels. Coverage of genetic variants was increased compared with previous studies by adding exome genotypes to previously available genome-wide data and using the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel for imputation. Standard quality control was applied. Phenotypes were symptom improvement and remission after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. Significant findings were investigated in NEWMEDS consortium samples and Pharmacogenomic Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS) for replication. A total of 7062 950 SNPs were analyzed in GENDEP (n=738) and STAR*D (n=1409). rs116692768 (P=1.80e-08, ITGA9 (integrin α9)) and rs76191705 (P=2.59e-08, NRXN3 (neurexin 3)) were significantly associated with symptom improvement during citalopram/escitalopram treatment. At the gene level, no consistent effect was found. At the pathway level, the Gene Ontology (GO) terms GO: 0005694 (chromosome) and GO: 0044427 (chromosomal part) were associated with improvement (corrected P=0.007 and 0.045, respectively). The association between rs116692768 and symptom improvement was replicated in PGRN-AMPS (P=0.047), whereas rs76191705 was not. The two SNPs did not replicate in NEWMEDS. ITGA9 codes for a membrane receptor for neurotrophins and NRXN3 is a transmembrane neuronal adhesion receptor involved in synaptic differentiation. Despite their meaningful biological rationale for being involved in antidepressant effect, replication was partial. Further studies may help in clarifying their role.	1428	1439	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	chromosomal	chromosomal

By 2004 the FDA had emerged as a champion of pharmacogenomics as an exemplar for novel approaches to drug development. This was made clear in 2004 when the agency released a wide-ranging report which positioned pharmacogenomics at the heart of a broader regulatory reform agenda. The Critical Path initiative addressed declining productivity of drug development by suggesting that the problem was a mismatch between the rapid pace of discovery in post-genomic biomedicine and the antiquated development process for new drugs. Framing their work in this context, FDA officials reconceptualised their role in the innovation process, in what was the first programmatic statement of a shift from a strictly gate-keeping role to a more collaborative or facilitative role as enablers of innovation. This paper situates the FDA's emergence as a champion of pharmacogenomics in the broader politics of pharmaceutical regulation in the USA. In making a contribution to the pharmaceuticalisation literature this paper will draw on the work of John Abraham who has argued that one of the primary drivers of pharmaceuticalisation has been "deregulatory state policies" and on Williams and colleagues who have argued that the changing relationship between regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry is an important dimension of pharmaceuticalisation. This paper links this to the promotion of pharmaceutical futures such as pharmacogenomics and explores how this shift is also closely related to the trend towards a risk management approach to pharmaceutical regulation. The role of Bush appointees in the development and promotion of the Critical Path agenda is also examined.	235	240	ORGAN	heart	heart
Kinetics-based dose targeting is often conducted in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients conditioned with intravenous (IV) or oral busulfan to lower rates of rejection, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse. Using the candidate gene approach, the authors evaluated whether busulfan clearance was associated with polymorphisms in the genes regulating the predominant metabolizing enzymes involved in busulfan conjugation, specifically glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoenzymes A1 (GSTA1) and M1 (GSTM1). Busulfan clearance was estimated after the morning dose on days 1, 2, and 3; each patient's average clearance was used for analyses. The average (± standard deviation) busulfan clearance was 3.2 ± 0.56 mL/min/kg in the separate population of 95 patients who received oral busulfan and 103 ± 24 ml/min/m(2) in the 57 patients who received IV busulfan. Oral busulfan clearance was associated with GSTA1 (P = .008) but not GSTM1 (P = .57) genotypes. However, among the GSTA1 haplotypes (ie, *A*A, *A*B, *B*B), there was significant overlap in the observed oral busulfan clearance and similar rates of achieving the target busulfan exposure. Clearance of IV busulfan was not associated with GSTA1 (P = .21) or GSTM1 (P = .99). These data suggest that personalizing either IV or oral busulfan dosing cannot be simplified on the basis of GSTA1 or GSTM1 genotype.	52	70	CELL	hematopoietic cell	hematopoietic cell
Kinetics-based dose targeting is often conducted in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients conditioned with intravenous (IV) or oral busulfan to lower rates of rejection, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse. Using the candidate gene approach, the authors evaluated whether busulfan clearance was associated with polymorphisms in the genes regulating the predominant metabolizing enzymes involved in busulfan conjugation, specifically glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoenzymes A1 (GSTA1) and M1 (GSTM1). Busulfan clearance was estimated after the morning dose on days 1, 2, and 3; each patient's average clearance was used for analyses. The average (± standard deviation) busulfan clearance was 3.2 ± 0.56 mL/min/kg in the separate population of 95 patients who received oral busulfan and 103 ± 24 ml/min/m(2) in the 57 patients who received IV busulfan. Oral busulfan clearance was associated with GSTA1 (P = .008) but not GSTM1 (P = .57) genotypes.

Inheritance plays a significant role in defining drug response and toxicity. Advances in molecular pharmacology and modern genomics emphasize genetic variation in dictating inter-individual pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A case in point is the homeostatic ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel, an established drug target that adjusts membrane excitability to match cellular energetic demand. There is an increased recognition that genetic variability of the K(ATP) channel impacts therapeutic decision-making in human disease.	346	354	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	membrane	membrane

Personalized medicine heralds the future of medicine. The 2009 Westlake International Conference on Personalized Medicine held from May 29-31, 2009, in Hangzhou, China (www.westlakeconference.org) brought together approximately 200 participants and over 40 presenters from a dozen countries. The conference was discussed in detail, with focus on the following major areas of personalized medicine: preventative and predictive medicine, cancer systems biology and therapy, physiology and artificial liver systems, nanotechnology and informatics, proteomics and systems pathology, genomics and pharmacogenomics, and epigenetics and new techniques. During the conference, the Asian Association of Systems Biology and Medicine (AASBM) was officially formed, and the ad hoc steering members for each of the major Asian countries were appointed to recruit key players from each country. The IBC (Interdisciplinary Bio Central) journal was suggested as the official journal for the AASBM, as it is a truly open journal (www.ibc7.org). The Web site for AASBM will be aasbm.org.	498	503	ORGAN	liver	liver
Despite improvements in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers, 5-year survival rates for advanced-stage patients remain disappointing. Therefore, the need exists to develop innovative new therapies while optimizing the current ones. Pharmacogenetics can be helpful in this context. Metabolism of cancer drugs varies according to age, gender, diet, concurrent use of other drugs, and existing comorbidities, including impaired liver and renal function. In addition, metabolizing enzymes, drug-transport proteins, metabolites, and drug receptors are genetically determined. It has also been demonstrated that genetic mutations within a tumor can be a determining factor with regard to response to treatment. The most common agents used in the treatment of digestive system tumors - 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, cisplatin, irinotecan, gemcitabine, and newly developed biologic agents bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab, and erlotinib-will be reviewed from a pharmacogenetic perspective. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 test in patients treated with irinotecan, and additional approval of newer tests is anticipated. Increasing availability of these sophisticated assays is expected to facilitate the delivery of more effective, less toxic chemotherapy regimens in the management of relatively resistant tumors of the gastrointestinal tract.	430	435	ORGAN	liver	liver
Pharmacotherapeutic options for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have increased dramatically in the last two decades and along with this have been substantial improvements in survival. Despite these advances, however, PAH remains a progressive and ultimately fatal disease for most patients and only epoprostenol has been shown to improve survival in a randomized control trial. Clinical observations of the heterogeneity of treatment response to different classes of medications across the phenotypically diverse PAH population has led to the identification of patients who derive significantly more benefit from certain medications than the population mean, the so-called "super responders." This was first recognized among PAH patients with acute vasodilator response during invasive hemodynamic testing, a subset of whom have dramatically improved survival when treated with calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy. Retrospective studies have now suggested a sex discrepancy in response to endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and more recently a few studies have found genomic associations with response to CCBs and ERAs. With increasing availability of "omics" technologies, recognition of these "super responders," combined with careful clinical and molecular phenotyping, will lead to advances in pharmacogenomics, precision medicine, and continued improvements in survival among PAH patients.	32	50	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	pulmonary arterial	pulmonary arterial
Warfarin has been used for the prevention of thrombosis for more than 50 years and is the most frequently prescribed vitamin K antagonist in North America (Gage & Eby, 2003). Its mode of action is to prevent vitamin K from converting to vitamin KH2, thereby inhibiting clotting factors (Johnson & Cavallari, 2015). Warfarin metabolism is affected by variations in the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1) genotypes. CYP2C9 affects the drug's pharmacokinetics, or metabolism, whereas VKORC1, the target protein of warfarin, affects the drug's pharmacodynamics, or its impact on cell proteins .	624	628	CELL	cell	cell
The pharmacogenetics of antimalarial agents are poorly known, although the application of pharmacogenetics might be critical in optimizing treatment. This population pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenetic study aimed at assessing the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytochrome P450 isoenzyme genes (CYP, namely, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) and the N-acetyltransferase 2 gene (NAT2) on the pharmacokinetics of artemisinin-based combination therapies in 150 Tanzanian patients treated with artemether-lumefantrine, 64 Cambodian patients treated with artesunate-mefloquine, and 61 Cambodian patients treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The frequency of SNPs varied with the enzyme and the population. Higher frequencies of mutant alleles were found in Cambodians than Tanzanians for CYP2C9*3, CYP2D6*10 (100C → T), CYP3A5*3, NAT2*6, and NAT2*7. In contrast, higher frequencies of mutant alleles were found in Tanzanians for CYP2D6*17 (1023C → T and 2850C → T), CYP3A4*1B, NAT2*5, and NAT2*14. For 8 SNPs, no significant differences in frequencies were observed. In the genetic-based population pharmacokinetic analyses, none of the SNPs improved model fit. This suggests that pharmacogenetic data need not be included in appropriate first-line treatments with the current artemisinin derivatives and quinolines for uncomplicated malaria in specific populations. However, it cannot be ruled out that our results represent isolated findings, and therefore more studies in different populations, ideally with the same artemisinin-based combination therapies, are needed to evaluate the influence of pharmacogenetic factors on the clearance of antimalarials.	844	852	CELL	CYP2C9*3	CYP2C9*3
The biological fingerprint of environmental adversity may be key to understanding health and disease, as it encompasses the damage induced as well as the compensatory reactions of the organism. Metabolic and hormonal changes may be an informative but incomplete window into the underlying biology. We endeavored to identify objective blood gene expression biomarkers for psychological stress, a subjective sensation with biological roots. To quantify the stress perception at a particular moment in time, we used a simple visual analog scale for life stress in psychiatric patients, a high-risk group. Then, using a stepwise discovery, prioritization, validation, and testing in independent cohort design, we were successful in identifying gene expression biomarkers that were predictive of high-stress states and of future psychiatric hospitalizations related to stress, more so when personalized by gender and diagnosis. One of the top biomarkers that survived discovery, prioritization, validation, and testing was FKBP5, a well-known gene involved in stress response, which serves as a de facto reassuring positive control. We also compared our biomarker findings with telomere length (TL), another well-established biological marker of psychological stress and show that newly identified predictive biomarkers such as NUB1, APOL3, MAD1L1, or NKTR are comparable or better state or trait predictors of stress than TL or FKBP5. Over half of the top predictive biomarkers for stress also had prior evidence of involvement in suicide, and the majority of them had evidence in other psychiatric disorders, providing a molecular underpinning for the effects of stress in those disorders. Some of the biomarkers are targets of existing drugs, of potential utility in patient stratification, and pharmacogenomics approaches. Based on our studies and analyses, the biomarkers with the best overall convergent functional evidence (CFE) for involvement in stress were FKBP5, DDX6, B2M, LAIR1, RTN4, and NUB1. Moreover, the biomarker gene expression signatures yielded leads for possible new drug candidates and natural compounds upon bioinformatics drug repurposing analyses, such as calcium folinate and betulin. Our work may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment for stress disorders such as PTSD, that result in decreased quality of life and adverse outcomes, including addictions, violence, and suicide.	334	339	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood	blood

The detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is of increasing importance in many areas including clinical diagnostics, patient stratification for pharmacogenomics, and advanced forensic analysis. In the work reported, we apply a semiautomated system for solid-phase electrochemical melting curve analysis (éMCA) for the identification of the allele present at a specific SNP site associated with an increased risk of bone fracture and predisposition to osteoporosis. Asymmetric isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification using ferrocene labeled forward primers was employed to generate single stranded redox labeled amplicons. In a first approach to demonstrate the proof of concept of combining asymmetric RPA with solid-phase éMCA, a simplified system housing a multielectrode array within a polymeric microsystem, sandwiched between two aluminum plates of a heater device, was used. Sample manipulation through the microfluidic channel was controlled by a syringe pump, and an external Ag/AgCl reference electrode was employed. Individual electrodes of the array were functionalized with four different oligonucleotide probes, each probe equivalent in design with the exception of the middle nucleotide. The isothermally generated amplicons were allowed to hybridize to the surface-tethered probes and subsequently subjected to a controlled temperature ramp, and the melting of the duplex was monitored electrochemically. A clear difference between the fully complementary and a single mismatch was observed. Having demonstrated the proof-of-concept, a device for automated éMCA with increased flexibility to house diverse electrode arrays with internal quasi-gold reference electrodes, higher resolution, and broader melting temperature range was developed and exploited for the detection of SNP hetero/homozygosity. Using the optimized conditions, the system was applied to the identification of the allele present at an osteoporosis associated SNP site, rs2741856, in 10 real fingerprick/venous blood samples, with results validated using Sanger sequencing.	428	432	TISSUE	bone	bone

Pharmacotherapy for pain currently involves trial and error. A previous study on inherited erythromelalgia (a genetic model of neuropathic pain due to mutations in the sodium channel, Na<sub>v</sub> 1.7) used genomics, structural modelling and biophysical and pharmacological analyses to guide pharmacotherapy and showed that carbamazepine normalizes voltage dependence of activation of the Na<sub>v</sub> 1.7-S241T mutant channel, reducing pain in patients carrying this mutation. However, whether this approach is applicable to other Na<sub>v</sub> channel mutants is still unknown.	91	106	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	erythromelalgia	erythromelalgia

Anthracyclines are one of the most widely used and effective chemotherapies in oncology, but their most important side effect is the cumulative, dose-related cardiotoxicity leading to congestive heart failure in ~5% of individuals. Methodology and pharmacogenetic studies for predicting which individuals are at high risk and subsequently the development of targeted and individualized cardioprotective plans are beginning to make progress. Here, we review current putative risk genes and variants, the strength of evidence for each genetic association and the interaction between risk genes, in the context of known clinical risk factors and potential novel cardioprotective strategies.	195	200	ORGAN	heart	heart
No pharmacogenetic studies have yet been conducted in community pharmacies, despite pharmacogenetics being an emerging discipline. Pharmacotherapeutic follow-up (PFU) was performed for 6 months in 37 patients receiving antihypertensive treatment, and they were genotyped for variant alleles *2 and *3 in the CYP2C9 gene and *1B in CYP3A4. Systolic blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, and adherence improved with PFU. Most of the interactions between drugs were represented by concurrent administration of statins and calcium channel blockers, which both use CYP3A4 for their metabolism. Heterozygotic patients for the CYP2C9*2 allele showed higher mean heart rate values after PFU than homozygous patients (73.4 ± 10.0 pulse/min vs 66.2 ± 10.6 pulse/min, respectively; P = .048). Carriers of CYP2C9*2 showed a tendency to less frequent negative outcomes associated with medication due to inefficacy than homozygous patients (50% vs 78.9%, respectively; P = .072). Pharmacogenetics and PFU can be used in community pharmacies to carry out a more exhaustive study of medication in hypertensive outpatients.	348	353	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood	blood

Heterozygotic patients for the CYP2C9*2 allele showed higher mean heart rate values after PFU than homozygous patients (73.4 ± 10.0 pulse/min vs 66.2 ± 10.6 pulse/min, respectively; P = .048). Carriers of CYP2C9*2 showed a tendency to less frequent negative outcomes associated with medication due to inefficacy than homozygous patients (50% vs 78.9%, respectively; P = .072). Pharmacogenetics and PFU can be used in community pharmacies to carry out a more exhaustive study of medication in hypertensive outpatients.	364	378	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular	cardiovascular
No pharmacogenetic studies have yet been conducted in community pharmacies, despite pharmacogenetics being an emerging discipline. Pharmacotherapeutic follow-up (PFU) was performed for 6 months in 37 patients receiving antihypertensive treatment, and they were genotyped for variant alleles *2 and *3 in the CYP2C9 gene and *1B in CYP3A4. Systolic blood pressure, cardiovascular risk, and adherence improved with PFU. Most of the interactions between drugs were represented by concurrent administration of statins and calcium channel blockers, which both use CYP3A4 for their metabolism.

<b>Background</b>: Angiogenesis inhibitors have become an important therapeutic approach in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The therapeutic inhibition of angiogenesis of Sorafenib in increasing overall survival of patients with HCC is a fundamental element of the treatment of this disease. Considering the heterogeneous aspects of HCC and to boost therapeutic efficacy, prevail over drug resistance and lessen toxicity, adding antiangiogenic drugs to antiblastic chemotherapy (AC), radiation therapy or other targeted drugs have been evaluated. The matter is additionally complicated by the combination of antiangiogenesis with further AC or biologic drugs. To date, no planned approach to understand which patients are more responsive to a given type of antiangiogenic treatment is available. <b>Conclusion</b>: Large investments in the clinical research are essential to improve treatment response and minimize toxicities for patients with HCC. Future investigations will need to focus on utilizing patterns of genetic information to classify HCC into groups that display similar prognosis and treatment sensitivity, and combining targeted therapies with AC producing enhanced anti-tumor effect. In this review the current panel of available antiangiogenic therapies for the treatment of HCC have been analyzed. In addition current clinical trials are also reported herein.	1	2	CELL	b	b

The most widely studied polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene are rs1128503 (c.1236C>T), rs2032582 (c.2677G>T/A), and rs1045642 (c.3435C>T). Although variation in ABCB1 allele frequencies among Mexican Mestizos (admixed) from different regions has been observed, Mexican Amerindians have been poorly studied. We aimed to describe the genetic variability of these three ABCB1 polymorphisms in a total sample of 273 Mexican volunteers that included Mestizos from the state of Yucatán, and Amerindians from seven populations (Tarahumara, Mayo, Huichol, Purépecha, Nahua, Tojolabal, and Maya). Genotypes were determined by means of Taq Man probes (qPCR). Genotype distribution was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all three ABCB1polymorphisms in the eight Mexican populations analyzed. For c.1236C>T and c.3435C>T, the heterozygous C/T was the most frequent genotype in the majority of the studied Mexican populations (range 30.8-65.4%), while heterozygous G/T was the most common genotype for c.2677G>T/A (range 25.9-51.2%), mainly followed by G/G (range 3.2-47.1%) and T/T (range 7.0-35.5%). 12 haplotypes were estimated from the three ABCB1 polymorphisms analyzed, with TTT the most frequent haplotype (mean, 37.0%). Genetic differentiation was demonstrated among the studied Mexican populations (Fst p value < 0.0001), which could imply a diverse drug response or a risk for adverse drug reactions to ABCB1 substrates. Although differences among Amerindians are probably due to genetic drift effects, for Mestizos this could imply variation in admixture composition. In conclusion, interpopulation variability in the observed frequencies of ABCB1 polymorphisms among Mexican Mestizos and Amerindians allow predicting diverse drug responses to ABCB1 substrates in these populations.	1062	1065	AMINO_ACID	T/T	T/T
Antipsychotic medications (APs), particularly second-generation APs, are associated with significant weight gain in schizophrenia patients. Recent evidence suggests that the immune system may contribute to antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) via AP-mediated alterations of cytokine levels. Antipsychotics with a high propensity for weight gain, such as clozapine and olanzapine, influence the expression of immune genes, and induce changes in serum cytokine levels to ultimately down-regulate neuroinflammation. Since inflammatory cytokines are normally involved in anorexigenic responses, reduced inflammation has been independently shown to mediate changes in feeding behaviours and other metabolic parameters, resulting in obesity. Genetic variation in pro-inflammatory cytokines is also associated with both general obesity and weight change during AP treatment, and thus, may be implicated in the pharmacogenetics of AIWG. At this time, preliminary data support a cytokine-mediated model of AIWG which may have clinical utility in developing more effective metabolic monitoring guidelines and prevention measures. However, further research is still needed to clearly elucidate the validity of this immune model. This article reviews the evidence implicating inflammatory cytokines in AIWG and its potential clinical relevance.	448	462	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum cytokine	serum cytokine
Cyclophosphamide remains a critical component to haploidentical transplant conditioning regimens. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) emerged as an effective component of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in the nonmyeloablative haploidentical bone marrow transplant setting. The relative ease of administration compared with ex vivo manipulations and efficacy in reducing GVHD has led to increasing PTCy use in transplant centers around the world. The role of PTCy has expanded to haploidentical transplantation with myeloablative conditioning regimens and peripheral blood progenitor cells as the donor source. Moreover, encouraging results in GVHD management have been shown with the use of PTCy alone or in combination with other immunosuppressives in the human leukocyte antigen-matched donor setting. The toxicity profile of cyclophosphamide varies extensively depending on dose, duration, overall drug exposure, and, potentially, pharmacogenetics. This review highlights the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxic effects of cyclophosphamide and offers practical guidance for clinical application in the post-transplant setting. We summarize data on the management of high-dose cyclophosphamide toxicities and provide insights into the pharmacogenetic implications on drug efficacy and safety data.	256	267	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	bone marrow	bone marrow

Human beings come in all shapes and sizes. Heterogeneity makes life interesting, but leads to inter-individual variation in disease susceptibility and response to therapy. One major health challenge is to develop "personalised medicine"; therapeutic interventions tailored to an individual to ensure optimal treatment of disease. Asthma is a heterogeneous disease with several different phenotypes triggered by multiple gene-environment interactions. Inhaled corticosteroids and β2-agonists have been the mainstay asthma therapies for 30 years, but they are not effective in all patients, while high costs and side-effects also drive the need for better targeted treatment of asthma. Pharmacogenetics is the study of variations in the genetic code for proteins in signaling pathways targeted by pharmacological therapies. Biomarkers are biological markers obtained from patients that can aid in asthma diagnosis, prediction of treatment response, and monitoring of disease control. This review presents a broad discussion of the use of genetic profiling and biomarkers to better diagnose, monitor, and tailor the treatment of asthmatics. We also discuss possible future developments in personalised medicine, including the construction of artificially engineered airway tissues containing a patient's own cells for use as personalised drug-testing tools.	479	490	CELL	β2-agonists	β2-agonists

Bioinformatics pipelines for calling star alleles (haplotypes) in cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes are important for the implementation of precision medicine. Genotyping CYP genes using high throughput sequencing data is complicated, e.g., by being highly polymorphic, not to mention the structural variations especially in CYP2D6, CYP2A6, and CYP2B6. Genome graph-based variant detection approaches have been shown to be reliable for genotyping HLA alleles. However, their application to enhancing star allele calling in CYP genes has not been extensively explored. We present StellarPGx, a Nextflow pipeline for accurately genotyping CYP genes by combining genome graph-based variant detection, read coverage information from the original reference-based alignments, and combinatorial diplotype assignments. The implementation of StellarPGx using Nextflow facilitates its portability, reproducibility, and scalability on various user platforms. StellarPGx is currently able to genotype 12 important pharmacogenes belonging to the CYP1, 2, and 3 families. For purposes of validation, we use CYP2D6 as a model gene owing to its high degree of polymorphisms (over 130 star alleles defined to date, including complex structural variants) and clinical importance. We applied StellarPGx and three existing callers to 109 whole genome sequenced samples for which the Genetic Testing Reference Material Coordination Program (GeT-RM) has recently provided consensus truth CYP2D6 diplotypes. StellarPGx had the highest CYP2D6 diplotype concordance (99%) with GeT-RM compared with Cyrius (98%), Aldy (82%), and Stargazer (84%). This exemplifies the high accuracy of StellarPGx and highlights its importance for both research and clinical pharmacogenomics applications. The StellarPGx pipeline is open-source and available from https://github.com/SBIMB/StellarPGx.	654	660	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome

Understanding and predicting inter-individual differences related to the success of drug therapy is of tremendous importance, both during drug development and for clinical applications. Importantly, while seminal twin studies indicate that the majority of inter-individual differences in drug disposition are driven by hereditary factors, common genetic polymorphisms explain only less than half of this genetically encoded variability. Recent progress in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has for the first time allowed to comprehensively map the genetic landscape of human pharmacogenes. Importantly, these projects have unveiled vast numbers of rare genetic variants, which are estimated to contribute substantially to the missing heritability of drug metabolism phenotypes. However, functional interpretation of these rare variants remains challenging and constitutes one of the important frontiers of contemporary pharmacogenomics. Furthermore, NGS technologies face challenges in the interrogation of genes residing in complex genomic regions, such as CYP2D6 and HLA genes. We here provide an update of the implementation of pharmacogenomic variations in the clinical setting and present emerging strategies that facilitate the translation of NGS data into clinically useful information. Importantly, we anticipate that these developments will soon result in a paradigm shift of pre-emptive genotyping away from the interrogation to candidate variants and towards the comprehensive profiling of an individuals genotype, thus allowing for a true individualization of patient drug treatment regimens.	205	212	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	seminal	seminal
Eighty-four subjects, premenopausal female patients (n = 42, mean (SD) age: 26.4 (4.2) years) diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 42, mean (SD) age: 27.6(3.4) years), were included in this study. Data on physical examination, anthropometric measurements and blood biochemistry analysis were recorded for each subject along with analysis for SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The relation of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism to PCOS status and insulin resistance was analysed via logistic regression analysis. Mean (SD) levels for BMI (28.5(6.5) vs.22.5 (4.9) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p < .001), HOMA-IR (3.1(1.8) vs.1.5 (1.0), p < .001), LDL-cholesterol (115.9(32.7) vs.100.7 (27.3)mg/dL, p = .03) and triglyceride (113.8(64.9) vs.83.3(36.3)mg/dL, p = .017) were significantly higher in patients. Groups were similar in terms of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism. No significant relation of this polymorphism was noted to PCOS and HOMA-IR. Our findings revealed no difference between groups in terms of the rate of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism, and no significant relation of this polymorphism to insulin resistance and PCOS status. Impact statement Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common cause of anovulation and the most commonly encountered form of female endocrine disease. SOCS proteins have been suggested to play a fundamental role in the negative feedback regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which is the major signalling pathway involved in a wide range of physiologic and pathologic processes, including inflammatory diseases, malignancies and immune disorders. Pathways involving the induction of suppression of SOCS proteins were also shown likely to be involved in mediating cytokine-induced insulin resistance. The present study was designed to determine the frequency of SOCS1-1478 CA/del gene polymorphism in patients with PCOS in relation to healthy controls and insulin resistance. Our findings revealed significantly higher rates of insulin resistance, obesity and dyslipidaemia in Turkish patients with PCOS compared with age-matched healthy controls, while no difference between study groups in terms of the rate of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism along with no significant relation of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism to insulin resistance and PCOS status. Future larger scale studies with the application of standardised diagnostic methods and criteria, and of state-of-the-art modern techniques including genomics, proteomics and pharmacogenetics would provide better understanding of the association between PCOS and genomic variants.	22	35	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	premenopausal	premenopausal

Pharmacogenomics has been implicated in the response variability of antiplatelet drugs in coronary artery disease (CAD), particularly for aspirin and clopidogrel. A large number of studies and several meta-analyses have been published on this topic, but until recently, there have been no clear conclusions and no definite guidelines on the clinical use of pharmacogenetic testing before prescribing antiplatelet drugs for CAD. In this review, the available evidence is summarized. The most consistent results are on clopidogrel, where CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles are associated with stent thrombosis events. We recommend to genotype for CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles in patients with CAD who are to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting, and to adjust the antiplatelet treatment based on the genotyping results.	90	105	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary artery	coronary artery

The in vivo fate and effectiveness of a drug depends highly on its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME-Tox). Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are membrane proteins involved in the cellular uptake of various organic compounds, including clinically used drugs. Since OATPs are significant players in drug absorption and distribution, modulation of OATP function via pharmacotherapy with OATP substrates/inhibitors, or modulation of their expression, affects drug pharmacokinetics. Given their cancer-specific expression, OATPs may also be considered anticancer drug targets. Areas covered: We describe the human OATP family, discussing clinically relevant consequences of altered OATP function. We offer a critical analysis of published data on the role of OATPs in ADME and in drug-drug interactions, especially focusing on OATP1A2, 1B1, 1B3 and 2B1. Expert opinion: Four members of the OATP family, 1A2, 1B1, 1B3 and 2B1, have been characterized in detail. As biochemical and pharmacological knowledge on the other OATPs is lacking, it seems timely to direct research efforts towards developing the experimental framework needed to investigate the transport mechanism and substrate specificity of the poorly described OATPs. In addition, elucidating the role of OATPs in tumor development and therapy response are critical avenues for further research.	192	200	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	membrane	membrane

Expert opinion: Four members of the OATP family, 1A2, 1B1, 1B3 and 2B1, have been characterized in detail. As biochemical and pharmacological knowledge on the other OATPs is lacking, it seems timely to direct research efforts towards developing the experimental framework needed to investigate the transport mechanism and substrate specificity of the poorly described OATPs. In addition, elucidating the role of OATPs in tumor development and therapy response are critical avenues for further research.	226	234	CELL	cellular	cellular
Many drugs on the market have the potential to cause undesirable side effects. Biomarkers used today, at best, diagnose an existing injury, such as cell death or abnormal functioning of an organ. More valuable would be biomarkers that could be used to prevent a patient from receiving an inappropriate drug or to identify very early signs of injury so the offending drug may be discontinued prior to overt tissue injury. Biomarkers currently used to identify drug-induced injury to the liver, heart and kidney will be discussed, as will some newer biomarkers. Progress on finding new biomarkers through the use of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomic approaches, consortia that may assist in their discovery and qualification for use, regulatory issues and the pharmacoeconomic considerations that may drive or hinder such new tests are also described.	148	152	CELL	cell	cell

The field of genetics, which includes the use of 'omic' technologies, is an evolving area of science that has emerging application in phytotherapy. Omic studies include pharmacogenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Herbal medicines, as monotherapies, or complex formulations such as traditional Chinese herbal prescriptions, may benefit from omic studies, and this new field may be termed 'herbomics'. Applying herbomics in the field of psychiatry may provide answers about which herbal interventions may be effective for individuals, which genetic processes are triggered, and the subsequent neurochemical pathways of activity. The use of proteomic technology can explore the differing epigenetic effects on neurochemical gene expression between individual herbs, isolated constituents and complex formulae. The possibilities of side effects or insufficient response to the herb can also be assessed via pharmacogenomic analysis of polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 liver enzymes or P-glycoprotein. While another novel application of omic technology is for the validation of the concept of synergy in individual herbal extracts and prescriptive formulations. Chronic administration of psychotropic herbal medicines may discover important effects on chromatin remodelling via modification of histone and DNA methylation. This paper focuses on the emerging field of herbomics, and is to our knowledge the first publication to explore this in the area of psychiatry.	1250	1259	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	chromatin	chromatin

We investigated the allele frequencies of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME)-related drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET) genes in the Northwestern Han, Tibetan and Uyghur populations and compared the related genes in these three populations with those in eleven 1000 Genome populations. We examined 1936 single nucleotide polymorphisms of 225 DMET genes involved in ADME processes and found 732, 679 and 804 sites were polymorphic in Han, Tibetan and Uyghur. Tibetan differed from Han in only four sites (p < .05), whereas Uyghur differed from Han and Tibetan in 24 and 21 sites, respectively (p < .05). The distributions of 1058 genotyping data of 245 individuals from Han, Tibetan and Uyghur were compared with 1207 other individuals from the eleven 1000 Genomes populations. The top four populations in Han that exhibited the smallest pairwise Fst values were CHB, Tibetan, CHD and JPT; those in Tibetan were Han, CHB, Uyghur and CHD; and those in Uyghur were Han, Tibetan, GIH and CEU. MEGA results revealed that CHB, CHD, JPT, Han, Tibetan and Uyghur were grouped in cluster 1. GIH, MEX, CEU and TSI were grouped in cluster 2. MKK, ASW, LWK and YRI were grouped in cluster 3.	929	932	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	JPT	JPT

For safe and effective use of antibacterial agents in neonates, specific knowledge on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and its covariates is needed. This necessitates a stepwise approach, including prospective validation. Areas covered: We describe our approach throughout almost two decades to improve amikacin exposure in neonates. A dosing regimen has been developed and validated using pharmacometrics, considering current weight, postnatal age, perinatal asphyxia, and ibuprofen use. This regimen has been developed based on clinical and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data collected during routine care, and subsequently underwent prospective validation. A similar approach has been scheduled to quantify the impact of hypothermia. Besides plasma observations, datasets on deep compartment PK were also collected. Finally, the available literature on developmental toxicology (hearing, renal) of amikacin is summarized. Expert opinion: The amikacin model reflects a semi-physiological function for glomerular filtration. Consequently, this model can be used to develop dosing regimens for other aminoglycosides or to validate physiology-based pharmacokinetic models. Future studies should explore safety with incorporation of covariates like pharmacogenetics, biomarkers, and long-term outcomes. This includes a search for mechanisms of developmental toxicity. Following knowledge generation and grading the level of evidence in support of data, dissemination and implementation initiatives are needed.	742	748	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma	plasma

Targeted therapies have greatly improved cancer patient prognosis. For instance, chronic myeloid leukemia is now well treated with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Around 80% of the patients reach complete remission. However, despite its great efficiency, some patients are resistant to the drug. This heterogeneity in the response might be associated with pharmacokinetic parameters, varying between individuals because of genetic variants. To assess this issue, next-generation sequencing of large panels of genes can be performed from patient samples. However, the common problem in pharmacogenetic studies is the availability of samples, often limited. In the end, large sequencing data are obtained from small sample sizes; therefore, classical statistical analyses cannot be applied to identify interesting targets. To overcome this concern, here, we described original and underused statistical methods to analyze large sequencing data from a restricted number of samples.	143	151	AMINO_ACID	tyrosine	tyrosine
It remains unclear why the dose of xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI) allopurinol or febuxostat varies among patients though they reach similar serum uric acid (SUA) goal. We pursued genomic sequencing of XOI metabolism and clearance genes to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relate to differences in XOI dose. Subjects with a diagnosis of Gout based on the 1977 American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria for the disorder, who were on stable doses of a XOI, and who were at their goal SUA level, were enrolled. The primary outcome was relationship between SNPs in any of these genes to XOI dose. The secondary outcome was relationship between SNPs and change in pre- and post-treatment SUA. We enrolled 100 subjects. The average patient age was 68.6 ± 10.6 years old. Over 80% were men and 77% were Caucasian. One SNP was associated with a higher XOI dose: rs75995567 (p = 0.031). Two SNPs were associated with 300 mg daily of allopurinol: rs11678615 (p = 0.022) and rs3731722 on Aldehyde Oxidase (AO) (His1297Arg) (p = 0.001). Two SNPs were associated with a lower dose of allopurinol: rs1884725 (p = 0.033) and rs34650714 (p = 0.006). For the secondary outcome, rs13415401 was the only SNP related to a smaller mean SUA change. Ten SNPs were identified with a larger change in SUA. Though multiple SNPs were identified in the primary and secondary outcomes of this study, rs3731722 is known to alter catalytic function for some aldehyde oxidase substrates.	143	158	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum uric acid	serum uric acid
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease with periods of exacerbation and remission of the disease. The etiology of IBD is not fully understood. Many studies point to the presence of genetic, immunological, environmental, and microbiological factors and the interactions between them in the occurrence of IBD. The review looks at genetic factors in the context of both IBD predisposition and pharmacogenetics.	13	18	ORGAN	bowel	bowel
High-dose methotrexate is a cornerstone agent in the chemotherapeutic treatment of patients with osteosarcoma. However, patients often develop methotrexate-induced toxicities. We aim to identify determinants of methotrexate-induced toxicities in osteosarcoma patients by investigating the relation between drug plasma levels, methotrexate-induced toxicities, and germline variants in genes related to drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination. A cohort of 114 osteosarcoma patients was genotyped for 1,931 variants in 231 genes using the Drug Metabolism Enzymes and Transporters Plus array. Methotrexate plasma levels and laboratory measurements during and after high-dose methotrexate treatment concerning renal function, liver damage, and myelopoiesis to reflect toxicity outcomes were obtained. One hundred and thirteen patients and a subset of 545 variants in 176 genes passed quality control checks. Methotrexate plasma levels showed associations with creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, and hemoglobin. Genetic variant rs3736599 in the 5'-untranslated region of <i>SULT1E1</i> was associated with lower 48 hour methotrexate plasma levels [coef -0.313 (95% CI -0.459 - -0.167); p = 2.60 × 10<sup>-5</sup>]. Association with methotrexate-induced decreased thrombocyte counts was found for two intronic variants in <i>CYP2B6</i> {rs4803418 [coef -0.187 (95% CI -0.275 - -0.099); p = 3.04 × 10<sup>-5</sup>] and rs4803419 [coef -0.186 (95% CI -0.278 - -0.093); p = 8.80 × 10<sup>-5</sup>]}. An association with increased thrombocyte counts was identified for the intronic variant rs4808326 in <i>CYP4F8</i> [coef 0.193 (95% CI 0.099 - 0.287); p = 6.02 × 10<sup>-5</sup>]. Moreover, a secondary analysis with a binary approach using CTCAE toxicity criteria resulted in a nominal significant associations (p < 0.05) for two out of three variants (rs4803418 and rs4808326). This is the first study to identify genetic variants in <i>SULT1E1, CYP2B6</i>, and <i>CYP4F8</i> to be associated with methotrexate pharmacokinetics and toxicities. Validation of these variants in an independent cohort and further functional investigation of variants in the identified genes is needed to determine if and how they affect methotrexate plasma levels and the development of methotrexate-induced toxicities.	311	317	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma	plasma

An association with increased thrombocyte counts was identified for the intronic variant rs4808326 in <i>CYP4F8</i> [coef 0.193 (95% CI 0.099 - 0.287); p = 6.02 × 10<sup>-5</sup>]. Moreover, a secondary analysis with a binary approach using CTCAE toxicity criteria resulted in a nominal significant associations (p < 0.05) for two out of three variants (rs4803418 and rs4808326). This is the first study to identify genetic variants in <i>SULT1E1, CYP2B6</i>, and <i>CYP4F8</i> to be associated with methotrexate pharmacokinetics and toxicities. Validation of these variants in an independent cohort and further functional investigation of variants in the identified genes is needed to determine if and how they affect methotrexate plasma levels and the development of methotrexate-induced toxicities.	2244	2250	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma	plasma
Enalapril is an orally administered angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor which is widely prescribed to treat hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. It is an ester prodrug that needs to be activated by carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). CES1 is a hepatic hydrolase that in vivo biotransforms enalapril to its active form enalaprilat in order to produce its desired pharmacological impact. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms in CES1 gene are reported to alter the catalytic activity of CES1 enzyme and influence enalapril metabolism. G143E, L40T, G142E, G147C, Y170D, and R171C can completely block the enalapril metabolism. Some polymorphisms like Q169P, E220G, and D269fs do not completely block the CES1 function; however, they reduce the catalytic activity of CES1 enzyme. The prevalence of these polymorphisms is not the same among all populations which necessitate to consider the genetic panel of respective population before prescribing enalapril. These genetic variations are also responsible for interindividual variability of CES1 enzyme activity which ultimately affects the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enalapril. The current review summarizes the CES1 polymorphisms which influence the enalapril metabolism and efficacy. The structure of CES1 catalytic domain and important amino acids impacting the catalytic activity of CES1 enzyme are also discussed. This review also highlights the importance of pharmacogenomics in personalized medicine.	134	140	ORGAN	kidney	kidney

The CYP2C9 enzyme metabolizes a wide range of relevant drugs, among which are oral anticoagulants. VKORC1 is the pharmacodynamic target of the oral anticoagulants. The genetic polymorphisms CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 -1639 G>A are the major determinants of the inter-individual variability in the dosage requirements of oral anticoagulants. This study provides a first evaluation of these 3 polymorphisms in a Romanian population. A total of 332 Romanian individuals were genotyped for the CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphisms using the PCR-RFLP technique. Sixty-two individuals (18.7%) were heterozygous for CYP2C9*2, whereas 47 individuals (14.1%) were heterozygous for CYP2C9*3. Fourteen individuals (4.2%) had a CYP2C9*2 homozygous, CYP2C9*3 homozygous or CYP2C9*2/CYP2C9*3 compound heterozygous genotype. These individuals are predicted to have the lowest CYP2C9 enzymatic activity. The allele frequencies of the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms were 11.3% and 9.3% respectively. For the VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism, there were 170 heterozygotes (51.2%) and 55 (16.6%) homozygotes for the A allele. The frequency of the A allele was 42.2%. Overall, the distribution of the CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3 and VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphisms observed in our cohort is in accordance with other Caucasian populations. A large number of Romanians are expected to harbour at least one CYP2C9 variant allele and/or one VKORC1 -1639 G>A allele. This frequency has major implications in the pharmacogenomics of oral anticoagulants in Romanians.	78	97	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants	oral anticoagulants

Morphine prescribed for analgesia has caused drug-related deaths at an estimated incidence of 0.3% to 4%. Morphine has pharmacological properties that make it particularly difficult to assess the causality of morphine administration with a patient's death, such as its slow transfer between plasma and central nervous sites of action and the existence of the active metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide with opioid agonistic effects, Furthermore, there is no well-defined toxic dose or plasma/blood concentration for morphine. Dosing is often adjusted for adequate pain relief. Here, we summarize reported deaths associated with morphine therapy, including associated morphine exposure and modulating patient factors such as pharmacogenetics, concomitant medications, or comorbidities. In addition, we systematically analyzed published numerical information on the stability of concentrations of morphine and its relevant metabolites in biological samples collected postmortem. A medicolegal case is presented in which the causality of morphine administration with death was in dispute and pharmacokinetic modeling was applied to infer the administered dose. The results of this analytical review suggest that (i) inference from postmortem blood concentrations to the morphine dose administered has low validity and (ii) causality between a patient's death and the morphine dose administered remains a highly context-dependent and collaborative assessment among experts from different medical specialties.	302	323	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous sites	central nervous sites

Hypertension continues to be a major risk factor for global mortality, and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have expanded in size, leading to the identification of further genetic loci influencing blood pressure. In light of the new knowledge from the largest cardiovascular GWAS to date, we review the potential impact of genomics on discovering potential drug targets, risk stratification with genetic risk scores, drug selection with pharmacogenetics, and exploring insights provided by gene-environment interactions.	210	215	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood	blood
The rising prevalence of primary pediatric hypertension and its tracking into adult hypertension point to the importance of determining its pathogenesis to gain insights into its current and emerging management. Considering that the intricate control of BP is governed by a myriad of anatomical, molecular biological, biochemical, and physiological systems, multiple genes are likely to influence an individual's BP and susceptibility to develop hypertension. The long-term regulation of BP rests on renal and non-renal mechanisms. One renal mechanism relates to sodium transport. The impaired renal sodium handling in primary hypertension and salt sensitivity may be caused by aberrant counter-regulatory natriuretic and anti-natriuretic pathways. The sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems are examples of antinatriuretic pathways. An important counter-regulatory natriuretic pathway is afforded by the renal autocrine/paracrine dopamine system, aberrations of which are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension, including that associated with obesity. We present updates on the complex interactions of these two systems with dietary salt intake in relation to obesity, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress. We review how insults during pregnancy such as maternal and paternal malnutrition, glucocorticoid exposure, infection, placental insufficiency, and treatments during the neonatal period have long-lasting effects in the regulation of renal function and BP. Moreover, these effects have sex differences. There is a need for early diagnosis, frequent monitoring, and timely management due to increasing evidence of premature target organ damage. Large controlled studies are needed to evaluate the long-term consequences of the treatment of elevated BP during childhood, especially to establish the validity of the current definition and treatment of pediatric hypertension.	594	606	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	renal sodium	renal sodium

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its complications such as diabetic macular edema continue to remain a major cause for legal blindness in the developed world. While the introduction of anti-tVEGF agents has significantly improved visual outcomes of patients with DR, unpredictable response, largely due to genetic polymorphisms, appears to be a challenge with this therapy. With advances in identification of various genetic biomarkers, novel therapeutic strategies consisting of gene transfer are being developed and tested for patients with DR. Application of pharmacogenetic principles appears to be a promising futuristic strategy to attenuate diabetes-mediated retinal vasculopathy. In this comprehensive review, data from recent studies in the field of pharmacogenomics for the treatment of DR have been provided.	73	78	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	edema	edema

P-glycoprotein encoded by the ABCB1 gene constitutes a molecular barrier in the small and large bowel epithelium, and its different expression may influence susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to assess the contribution of the C3435T polymorphism to disease risk in the Polish population. A total of 100 patients (50 Crohn's disease (CD), 50 ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 100 healthy controls were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C3435T by using the PCR-RFLP method. Patients were classified on the basis of disease phenotype and the specific treatment used. A meta-analysis was carried out of our results and those from previously published Polish studies. There was no significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies in IBD patients compared with controls. For CD patients, a lower frequency of TT genotype in those with colonic disease, a lower frequency of T allele, and a higher frequency of C allele in those with luminal disease were observed, whereas for UC patients, a lower frequency of CT genotype was observed in those with left-sided colitis. A meta-analysis showed a tendency towards higher prevalence of CC genotype in UC cases. These results indicate that the C3435T variants may confer a risk for UC and influence disease behaviour.	96	112	TISSUE	bowel epithelium	bowel epithelium

A total of 100 patients (50 Crohn's disease (CD), 50 ulcerative colitis (UC)) and 100 healthy controls were genotyped for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) C3435T by using the PCR-RFLP method. Patients were classified on the basis of disease phenotype and the specific treatment used. A meta-analysis was carried out of our results and those from previously published Polish studies. There was no significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies in IBD patients compared with controls. For CD patients, a lower frequency of TT genotype in those with colonic disease, a lower frequency of T allele, and a higher frequency of C allele in those with luminal disease were observed, whereas for UC patients, a lower frequency of CT genotype was observed in those with left-sided colitis. A meta-analysis showed a tendency towards higher prevalence of CC genotype in UC cases. These results indicate that the C3435T variants may confer a risk for UC and influence disease behaviour.	1191	1193	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	UC	UC

The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment has improved our understanding and management of complex pharmacological issues that have driven improved outcomes and quality of life of the HIV-infected patient. These issues include adherence, long- and short-term toxicities, pharmacoenhancement, pharmacogenomics, therapeutic drug monitoring, differential penetration of drugs into sanctuary sites, such as the central nervous system, genital tract and small bowel, and drug-drug and drug-food interactions related to cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferases and drug transporters, to name a few. There is future promise, as an increased understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HIV and global public health initiatives are driving novel treatment approaches with goals to prevent, control and, ultimately, eradicate HIV.	427	449	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system	central nervous system

Existing warfarin dose prediction algorithms based on pharmacogenetics and clinical parameters have not been used clinically due to the absence of external validation, lack of assessment for clinical utility, and high risk of bias. Moreover, given the high degree of heterogeneity across different datasets used to develop these algorithms, it is unsurprising that prediction errors remain high, and dosing accuracy is dependent on specific ethnic populations. To circumvent these challenges, deep neural models are increasingly used to improve the precision and accuracy of warfarin dose predictions. Hence, this study sought to develop a deep learning-based model using a well-established curated dataset of over 6000 patients from the International Warfarin Pharmacogenomics Consortium (IWPC). Clinically-relevant input data such as physical attributes, medical conditions, concomitant medications, genotype status of functional warfarin genetic polymorphisms, and therapeutic INR were entered followed by applying a unique and robust training and validation method. The deep model yielded a low average mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.6 mg/week and a relatively low mean percentage of error of 40.9% in Asians, 14.2 mg/week MAE and 36.9% in African Americans, and 12.7 mg/week MAE and 45.4% mean percentage of error in White Caucasians. This model also resulted in 36.4% of all patients with a predicted dose within 20% of the administered dose. Hence, our proposed deep model provides an alternative to predicting warfarin dose in the clinical setting upon validation in ethnically-similar datasets.	797	816	ORGAN	Clinically-relevant	Clinically-relevant

With the aging population and its rapidly increasing prevalence, dementia has become an important public health concern in developed and developing countries. To date, the pharmacological treatment is symptomatic and based on the observed neurotransmitter disturbances. The four most commonly used drugs are donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine. Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles. Donepezil inhibits selectively the acetylcholinesterase and has a long elimination half-life (t(1/2)) of 70 h. Galantamine is also a selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, but also modulates presynaptic nicotinic receptors. It has a t(1/2) of 6-8 h. Donepezil and galantamine are mainly metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP3A4 in the liver. Rivastigmine is a so-called 'pseudo-irreversible' inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. The t(1/2) of the drug is very short (1-2 h), but the duration of action is longer as the enzymes are blocked for around 8.5 and 3.5 h, respectively. Rivastigmine is metabolised by esterases in liver and intestine. Memantine is a non-competitive low-affinity antagonist of the NMDA receptor with a t(1/2) of 70 h. Its major route of elimination is unchanged via the kidneys. Addressing the issue of inter-patient variability in treatment response might be of special importance for the vulnerable population taking anti-dementia drugs. Pharmacogenetic considerations might help to avoid multiple medication changes due to non-response and/or adverse events. Some pharmacogenetic studies conducted on donepezil and galantamine reported an influence of the CYP2D6 genotype on the pharmacokinetics of the drugs and/or on the response to treatment. Moreover, polymorphisms in genes of the cholinergic markers acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase and paraoxonase were found to be associated with better clinical response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. However, confirmation studies in larger populations are necessary to establish evidence of which subgroups of patients will most likely benefit from anti-dementia drugs. The aim of this review is to summarize the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the four commonly used anti-dementia drugs and to give an overview on the current knowledge of pharmacogenetics in this field.	846	851	ORGAN	liver	liver

Antidepressant drugs can have significant effects on the mood of a patient suffering from major depression or other disorders. The pharmacological actions of these drugs generally affect the uptake or metabolism of the neurotransmitters serotonin, noradrenalin, and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. However, many aspects of antidepressant action are not understood. We conducted a proteomic analysis in a neuronal cell culture model in an attempt to identify molecules important to the operation of pathways functionally relevant to antidepressant action. The model involved generating cultures containing mixed neural and glial cells by controlled differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, followed by exposure to 1 microM paroxetine for 14 days. After antidepressant exposure, we observed increased expression or modification of sepiapterin reductase (SPR), heat shock protein 9A, RAS and EF-hand domain containing, and protein disulfide isomerase associated 3 and decreased expression or modification of creatine kinase, actin, prohibitin, a T-cell receptor alpha chain, defensin-related cryptdin 5, and the intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin. SPR, the most strongly up-regulated protein observed, controls production of tetrahydrobiopterin, an essential cofactor for the synthesis of many neurotransmitters including serotonin, making it a plausible and intriguing candidate protein for involvement in mood control and antidepressant drug action. SPR and the other proteins identified may represent links to molecular processes of importance to mood dysregulation and control, and their respective genes may be novel candidates for the study of antidepressant pharmacogenetics.	219	246	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	neurotransmitters serotonin	neurotransmitters serotonin
Predicting risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) is an evidence-based practice that incorporates lifestyle, history, and other risk factors. Statins reduce risk for MACE by decreasing lipids, but it is difficult to stratify risk following initiation of a statin. Genetic risk determinants for on-statin MACE are low-effect size and impossible to generalize. Our objective was to determine high-level epistatic risk factors for on-statin MACE with GWAS-scale data. Controlled-access data for 5890 subjects taking a statin collected from Vanderbilt University Medical Center's BioVU were obtained from dbGaP. We used Random Forest Iterative Feature Reduction and Selection (RF-IFRS) to select highly informative genetic and environmental features from a GWAS-scale dataset of patients taking statin medications. Variant-pairs were distilled into overlapping networks and assembled into individual decision trees to provide an interpretable set of variants and associated risk. 1718 cases who suffered MACE and 4172 controls were obtained from dbGaP. Pathway analysis showed that variants in genes related to vasculogenesis (FDR = 0.024), angiogenesis (FDR = 0.019), and carotid artery disease (FDR = 0.034) were related to risk for on-statin MACE. We identified six gene-variant networks that predicted odds of on-statin MACE. The most elevated risk was found in a small subset of patients carrying variants in <i>COL4A2</i>, <i>TMEM178B</i>, <i>SZT2</i>, and <i>TBXAS1</i> (OR = 4.53, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The RF-IFRS method is a viable method for interpreting complex "black-box" findings from machine-learning. In this study, it identified epistatic networks that could be applied to risk estimation for on-statin MACE. Further study will seek to replicate these findings in other populations.	1182	1196	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	carotid artery	carotid artery
Clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics will help in personalizing drug prescriptions and alleviate the personal and financial burden due to inefficacy and adverse reactions to drugs. However, such implementation is lagging in many parts of the world, including the Middle East, mainly due to the lack of data on the distribution of actionable pharmacogenomic variation in these ethnicities. We analyzed 6,045 whole genomes from the Qatari population for the distribution of allele frequencies of 2,629 variants in 1,026 genes known to affect 559 drugs or classes of drugs. We also performed a focused analysis of genotypes or diplotypes of 15 genes affecting 46 drugs, which have guidelines for clinical implementation and predicted their phenotypic impact. The allele frequencies of 1,320 variants in 703 genes affecting 299 drugs or class of drugs were significantly different between the Qatari population and other world populations. On average, Qataris carry 3.6 actionable genotypes/diplotypes, affecting 13 drugs with guidelines for clinical implementation, and 99.5% of the individuals had at least one clinically actionable genotype/diplotype. Increased risk of simvastatin-induced myopathy could be predicted in ~32% of Qataris from the diplotypes of SLCO1B1, which is higher compared to many other populations, while fewer Qataris may need tacrolimus dosage adjustments for achieving immunosuppression based on the CYP3A5 diplotypes compared to other world populations. Distinct distribution of actionable pharmacogenomic variation was also observed among the Qatari subpopulations. Our comprehensive study of the distribution of actionable genetic variation affecting drugs in a Middle Eastern population has potential implications for preemptive pharmacogenomic implementation in the region and beyond.	1431	1437	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	CYP3A5	CYP3A5
EVALUATION OF: Liggett SB, Cresci S, Kelly RJ et al.: A GRK5 polymorphism that inhibits beta-adrenergic receptor signaling is protective in heart failure. Nat. Med. 14, 510-517 (2008). beta-Adrenoceptor blockade therapy was developed for the treatment of hypertension but is now also a cornerstone in the treatment of heart failure. Based on the mechanisms of action and current knowledge of pathway signaling, Ligget et al. hypothesized that genetic variants within G-protein coupled receptor kinases might alter disease course and response to beta-adrenoceptor blockade therapy. Following a multistep approach, a common variant in GRK5 was identified as being important in vitro and in vivo (mouse model) in beta-adrenergic desensitization, and was epidemiologically related to survival and therapy response in African-Americans. Although such a variety of research approaches is appealing, owing to the large number of used methods readers remain puzzled on some issues because it is not possible to give all details of each individual study. Therefore, interpretation of the overwhelming amount of results is difficult. In an era of shifting emphasis from classic hypothesis driven pharmacogenetics to genome-wide association studies, this study shows that hypothesis driven translational research is still of high value, especially in phenotypes as investigated here.	140	145	ORGAN	heart	heart

Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep is a paradoxical sleep state characterized by brain activity similar to wakefulness, rapid-eye-movement, and lack of muscle tone. REM sleep is a fundamental brain function, evolutionary conserved across species, including human, mouse, bird, and even reptiles. The physiological importance of REM sleep is highlighted by severe sleep disorders incurred by a failure in REM sleep regulation. Despite the intense interest in the mechanism of REM sleep regulation, the molecular machinery is largely left to be investigated. In models of REM sleep regulation, acetylcholine has been a pivotal component. However, even newly emerged techniques such as pharmacogenetics and optogenetics have not fully clarified the function of acetylcholine either at the cellular level or neural-circuit level. Recently, we discovered that the G <sub><i>q</i></sub> type muscarinic acetylcholine receptor genes, <i>Chrm1</i> and <i>Chrm3</i>, are essential for REM sleep. In this review, we develop the perspective of current knowledge on REM sleep from a molecular viewpoint. This should be a starting point to clarify the molecular and cellular machinery underlying REM sleep regulation and will provide insights to explore physiological functions of REM sleep and its pathological roles in REM-sleep-related disorders such as depression, PTSD, and neurodegenerative diseases.	77	82	ORGAN	brain	brain

This should be a starting point to clarify the molecular and cellular machinery underlying REM sleep regulation and will provide insights to explore physiological functions of REM sleep and its pathological roles in REM-sleep-related disorders such as depression, PTSD, and neurodegenerative diseases.	188	193	ORGAN	brain	brain

Neuromuscular diseases are clinically and genetically heterogeneous and probably contain the greatest proportion of causative Mendelian defects than any other group of conditions. These disorders affect muscle and/or nerves with neonatal, childhood or adulthood onset, with significant disability and early mortality. Along with heterogeneity, unidentified and often very large genes require complementary and comprehensive methods in routine molecular diagnosis. Inevitably, this leads to increased diagnostic delays and challenges in the interpretation of genetic variants.	203	209	TISSUE	muscle	muscle

<b>Objectives:</b> Dopamine plays an important role in modulating attention and motor behaviours, dimensions altered in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Numerous association studies have linked dopamine receptor 4 (<i>DRD4</i>) to increased risk of ADHD. This study investigated the effect of <i>DRD4</i> exon 3 polymorphism on child behaviours in response to treatment with methylphenidate. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 374 children diagnosed with ADHD (ages 6-12 years) were evaluated under three experimental conditions: baseline, placebo and MPH (0.5 mg/kg/day). This was a 2-week prospective within-subject, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The Conners' Global Index for parents and for teachers was used to evaluate the behaviours of the children. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test the effect of the interaction between <i>DRD4</i> genotype and experimental conditions. <b>Results:</b> A significant interaction between <i>DRD4</i> genotype and treatment was detected when the child's behaviour was evaluated by the parents (<i>P</i> = 0.035, effect size of 0.014), driven by a better treatment response in children homozygous for long 7-repeat allele. <b>Conclusions:</b> According to the parent assessment, children homozygous for the long 7-repeat allele were more responsive to experimental condition. This is the largest pharmacogenetic investigation of the effect of <i>DRD4</i> exon 3 polymorphism in childhood ADHD. <b>Trial Registration:</b> clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT00483106.	265	269	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	ADHD	ADHD

Thiopurines have been widely used for the maintenance of remission or steroid sparing in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. However, potential drug-related adverse events frequently interfere with their use. Indeed, drug withdrawals associated with adverse reactions have been reported in approximately 25% of patients. To balance the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of thiopurines, regular monitoring of biomarkers (complete blood cell count, liver function test, and metabolic profiles), steady dose escalation, and pretreatment thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) genotype screening have been routinely recommended. However, the complex thiopurine metabolic pathway and individual differences attributed to pharmacogenetic diversity limit the effectiveness of these strategies in the optimization of thiopurine therapy. Recently, in an effort to facilitate more accurate and personalized prediction of thiopurine response or toxicity, novel genetic markers including NUDT15 and FTO genes were discovered. These discoveries are remarkable because TPMT screening has minimal efficacy for predicting myelosuppression especially in Asian populations, despite the fact that thee populations have a higher frequency of myelosuppression than Western populations. This review focuses on the current understanding of the metabolic pathway and the pharmacogenetics of thiopurines and suggests a personalized preventive strategy against potential adverse drug reactions to optimize their therapeutic application.	116	121	ORGAN	bowel	bowel

Fibromyalgia (FM) and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) are diseases of unknown etiology presenting complex and often overlapping symptomatology. Despite promising advances on the study of miRNomes of these diseases, no validated molecular diagnostic biomarker yet exists. Since FM and ME/CFS patient treatments commonly include polypharmacy, it is of concern that biomarker miRNAs are masked by drug interactions. Aiming at discriminating between drug-effects and true disease-associated differential miRNA expression, we evaluated the potential impact of commonly prescribed drugs on disease miRNomes, as reported by the literature. By using the web search tools SM2miR, Pharmaco-miR, and repoDB, we found a list of commonly prescribed drugs that impact FM and ME/CFS miRNomes and therefore could be interfering in the process of biomarker discovery. On another end, disease-associated miRNomes may incline a patient's response to treatment and toxicity. Here, we explored treatments for diseases in general that could be affected by FM and ME/CFS miRNomes, finding a long list of them, including treatments for lymphoma, a type of cancer affecting ME/CFS patients at a higher rate than healthy population. We conclude that FM and ME/CFS miRNomes could help refine pharmacogenomic/pharmacoepigenomic analysis to elevate future personalized medicine and precision medicine programs in the clinic.	14	16	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	FM	FM
Teratology is the study of anatomical and physiological abnormalities, commonly known as birth defects. If an embryo is exposed to a harmful substance, or teratogen, during the critical period of development, an ensuing malformation may occur. These malformations and their associated mechanisms are studied and analyzed in laboratory animals in order to prevent them from occurring in humans. Rodents, such as rabbits, rats, and mice, have commonly been used in such studies because of their similarity to humans. In 1959, James G. Wilson designed, developed, and tested a protocol on how to observe and analyze structural malformations in rodent fetuses, which included external examination, skeletal evaluation, soft tissue analysis, and data collection/analysis. Although many years have passed since Wilson created this protocol, it is still widely used to this day, and only minor changes have been made to his instructions such as the chemicals used in the experiments and also the analysis of the experimental data. While only minor modifications have been made to this protocol since its beginning, major advances have been made in the dissemination of teratology information to the public such that information is now available through the Internet--information including the identification of an increasing number of teratogens and the understanding of the pathogenesis as it relates to the etiology of birth defects. Despite these advances, however, there has been little decrease in the overall incidence of major birth defects, although significantly improved reporting and ascertainment of birth defects must be factored into the equation in determining birth defect rates. Future birth defect prevention may be based on the understanding of individual genomes and pharmacogenomics, and as the interaction between teratogenic and genetic factors is better understood--with the hope that the incidence of both chemically induced and genetic defects will one day be substantially reduced.	694	702	TISSUE	skeletal	skeletal

To provide the best patient care related to medication administration and prescription, an understanding of the specific enzymes is essential. Enzymes affect the metabolizing of most medications that nurses administer and that nurse practitioners and physicians prescribe on a regular basis. More specifically, the most important p450 enzymes in drug metabolism are cytochrome p450 (CYP) 1A2, the CYP2C family, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In addition, the enzymes are instrumental in the body's reaction to environmental factors, some of which are carcinogens.	480	484	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	body	body
Triazole antifungal agents are often prescribed as first-line therapy for candidemia, in non-neutropenic hosts and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and in critically ill patients who receive many concomitant medications. As substrates and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP), the triazoles can interact with many drugs, which may lead to enhanced toxicity of the concomitant medication(s) or ineffective antifungal treatment. Therefore, clinicians must understand the drug interaction profile of this class.	124	133	ORGAN	pulmonary	pulmonary

Human cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) accounts for approximately 20% of total hepatic CYP content and metabolizes approximately 15% clinically used drugs including S-warfarin, tolbutamide, phenytoin, losartan, diclofenac, and celecoxib. To date, there are at least 33 variants of CYP2C9 (*1B through to *34) being identified. CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 differ from the wild-type CYP2C9*1 by a single point mutation: CYP2C9*2 is characterised by a 430C>T exchange in exon 3 resulting in an Arg144Cys amino acid substitution, whereas CYP2C9*3 shows an exchange of 1075A>C in exon 7 causing an Ile359Leu substitution in the catalytic site of the enzyme. CYP2C9*2 is frequent among Caucasians with approximately 1% of the population being homozygous carriers and 22% heterozygous. The corresponding figures for the CYP2C9*3 allele are 0.4% and 15%, respectively. Worldwide, a number of other variants have also to be considered. The CYP2C9 polymorphisms are relevant for the efficacy and adverse effects of numerous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, sulfonylurea antidiabetic drugs and, most critically, oral anticoagulants belonging to the class of vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitors. Numerous clinical studies have shown that the CYP2C9 polymorphism should be considered in warfarin therapy and practical algorithms how to consider it in therapy are available. These studies have highlighted the importance of the CYP2C9*2 and *3 alleles. Warfarin has served as a practical example of how pharmacogenetics can be utilized to achieve maximum efficacy and minimum toxicity. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 have the potential to affect the toxicity of CYP2C9 drugs with somewhat lower therapeutic indices such as warfarin, phenytoin, and certain antidiabetic drugs. CYP2C9 is one of the clinically significant drug metabolising enzymes that demonstrates genetic variants with significant phenotype and clinical outcomes. Genetic testing of CYP2C9 is expected to have a role in predicting drug clearance and implementing individualized pharmacotherapy. Prospective clinical studies with large samples are required to establish gene-dose and gene-effect relatiohsips for CYP2C9.	1097	1116	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants	oral anticoagulants

Antipsychotic drugs are limited in their efficacy by the relatively poor response of negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia as well as by the substantial variability in response between patients. Pharmacogenetic studies have sought to identify the genetic factors that underlie the individual variability in response to treatment, with a past emphasis on dopamine and serotonin receptors as candidate genes. Few studies have separated effects on positive and negative symptoms, despite the established differences in response to drug treatment between these syndromes. Where this has been done most findings are consistent with the conclusion that dopamine receptor polymorphisms relate to positive symptom response, while negative symptom improvement is influenced by polymorphisms of genes involved in 5-HT neurotransmission. A wide range of polymorphisms in other candidate genes have been investigated, with some positive findings in those genes associated with glutamatergic transmission and/or risk factors for schizophrenia. However, there remains a lack of good replicated findings; furthermore there is little evidence to support drug-specific genetic associations with treatment response. While most past studies focused on single candidate genes, technology now permits genome-wide association studies with response to antipsychotics. Although not without major limitations, these "hypothesis-free" approaches are beginning to identify further important risk factors for treatment response. Again there is little consistency between various studies, although some of the polymorphisms identified are in genes involved in neurodevelopment, which is increasingly being recognized as important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.	976	989	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	glutamatergic	glutamatergic
Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) represents a common final pathway leading to heart failure. We have searched for genetic determinants of left ventricular (LV) mass using values for absolute electrocardiographic QRS voltage in a healthy Japanese population. After adjusting for covariates, the corrected S and R wave voltages in leads V1 and V5 from 2,994 healthy volunteers in the Japan Pharmacogenomics Data Science Consortium (JPDSC) database were subjected to a genome-wide association study. Potential associations were validated by an in silico replication study using an independent Japanese population obtained from the Nagahama Prospective Genome Cohort for Comprehensive Human Bioscience. We identified a novel association between the lead V5, R wave voltage in Japanese individuals and SNP rs7301743[G], which maps near the gene encoding T-box transcription factor Tbx3. Meta-analysis of two independent Japanese datasets demonstrated a marginally significant association of SNP rs7301743 in TBX3|MED13L with a 0.071 mV (95% CI, 0.038-0.11 mV) shorter R wave amplitude in the V5 lead per minor allele copy (P = 7.635 x 10(-8)). The transcriptional repressor, TBX3, is proposed to suppress the development of working ventricular myocardium. Our findings suggest that genetic variation of Tbx3 is associated with LV mass in a healthy Japanese population.	0	16	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	Left ventricular	Left ventricular

Clozapine is primarily metabolized via cytochrome P450(CYP)1A2 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Metabolic inhibitors of clozapine, such as fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin, are important to recognize to avoid adverse drug events. Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives (eOCPs) are weaker CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 inhibitors but are associated with a 2-fold increase of clozapine concentrations. The potential for phenoconversion due to a CYP genetic polymorphism can add additional complexities when considering drug interactions. A case report is presented of a suspected interaction between newly initiated clozapine and a prescribed eOCP for which the patient's pharmacogenomic status was known. A 17-year-old, nonsmoking, White female with a history of schizophrenia was initiated on clozapine 12.5 mg at bedtime with a plan to increase by 25 mg every 4 days in the outpatient setting. The patient was a known rapid CYP1A2 metabolizer without identified sources of CYP1A2 induction and a CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer. Based on pharmacogenomic testing, there was no suspicion for significant gene-drug interactions. Yet, as the patient was prescribed an eOCP, a clozapine concentration was obtained after reaching 150 mg at bedtime. This steady-state clozapine concentration was found to be 560 ng/mL, correlating with worsening sedation and constipation. Given ongoing side effects, clozapine was lowered to 100 mg at bedtime; however, ongoing intolerance ultimately led to clozapine discontinuation. This case highlights the potential interaction between clozapine and eOCP in a CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer, leading to clozapine intolerance and discontinuation. The concomitant use of clozapine and eOCPs should be undertaken judiciously.	266	285	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral contraceptives	oral contraceptives
Gastric cancer is a common heterogeneous tumor. Most patients have advanced gastric cancer at the time of diagnosis and often need chemotherapy. Although 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is widely used for treatment, its therapeutic sensitivity and drug tolerance still need to be determined, which emphasizes the importance of individualized administration. Pharmacogenetics can guide the clinical implementation of individualized treatment. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as a genetic marker, contribute to the selection of appropriate chemotherapy regimens and dosages. Some SNPs are associated with folate metabolism, the therapeutic target of 5-FU. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rs1801131 and rs1801133, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) rs1650697 and rs442767, methionine synthase (MTR) rs1805087, gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) rs11545078 and solute carrier family 19 member 1 (SLC19A1) rs1051298 have been investigated in different kinds of cancers and antifolate antitumor drugs, which have potential forecasting and guiding significance for application of 5-FU. The ion torrent next-generation semiconductor sequencing technology can rapidly detect gastric cancer-related SNPs. Each time a base is extended in a DNA chain, an H<sup>+</sup> will be released, causing local pH changes. The ionic sensor detects pH changes and converts chemical signals into digital signals, achieving sequencing by synthesis. This technique has low sample requirement, simple operation, low cost, and fast sequencing speed, which is beneficial for guiding individualized chemotherapy by SNPs.	1168	1175	ORGAN	gastric	gastric
Gastric cancer is a common heterogeneous tumor. Most patients have advanced gastric cancer at the time of diagnosis and often need chemotherapy. Although 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is widely used for treatment, its therapeutic sensitivity and drug tolerance still need to be determined, which emphasizes the importance of individualized administration. Pharmacogenetics can guide the clinical implementation of individualized treatment. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as a genetic marker, contribute to the selection of appropriate chemotherapy regimens and dosages. Some SNPs are associated with folate metabolism, the therapeutic target of 5-FU.

The objective of this prospective study was to examine the exposure to the main active metabolites of ciprofloxacin in critically ill patients and to examine the factors (demographic, laboratory and genetic) that could potentially affect the drug metabolic conversion of ciprofloxacin. The secondary aim was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for the metabolite showing the most associations with the abovementioned factors. A total of 29 patients were treated with intravenous infusion of ciprofloxacin and enrolled on this trial. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken at 1, 4, and 11.5 h following the completion of the infusion. Sex, age, body weight, height, serum creatinine and bilirubin levels, and creatinine clearance (CL<sub>CR</sub>) were recorded, and polymorphisms rs2032582 and rs1045642 in the <i>ABCB1</i> gene, rs4148977 in the <i>SLCO1A2</i> gene and rs762551 in the <i>CYP1A2</i> gene were analyzed. A three-stage parent drug-metabolite population pharmacokinetic model was developed. Median (IQR) metabolite/parent ratios of the desethylene ciprofloxacin, formyl ciprofloxacin and oxociprofloxacin were 5.86 (4.09-9.87)%, 4.08 (3.38-6.92)% and 5.91 (3.42-13.65)%, respectively. The desethylene ciprofloxacin metabolic ratio was positively associated with height (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2277, <i>p</i> = 0.0089) and CL<sub>CR</sub> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2023, <i>p</i> = 0.0144) and negatively associated with age (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2227, <i>p</i> = 0.0112). Males had a significantly higher oxociprofloxacin metabolic ratio than females (9.14 vs 3.42%, <i>p</i> = 0.0043). In the desethylene ciprofloxacin population PK model, the volume of distribution decreased with age, the parent drug-metabolite transfer rate constant increased with CL<sub>CR</sub>, and the metabolite elimination rate constant decreased with age and is increased in <i>CYP1A2</i> rs762551 variant allele carriers. We therefore hypothesized that the CYP1A2 inhibition by ciprofloxacin is mediated by its metabolite desethylene ciprofloxacin.	477	488	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	intravenous	intravenous

Pharmacogenomics is a tool for practitioners to provide precision pharmacotherapy using genomics. All providers are likely to encounter genomic data in practice with the expectation that they are able to successfully apply it to patient care. Pharmacogenomics tests for genetic variations in genes that are responsible for drug metabolism, transport, and targets of drug action. Variations can increase the risk for drug toxicity or poor efficacy. Pharmacogenomics can, therefore, be used to help select the best medication or aid in dosing. Nephrologists routinely treat cardiovascular disease and manage patients after kidney transplantation, two situations for which there are several high-evidence clinical recommendations for commonly used anticoagulants, antiplatelets, statins, and transplant medications. Successful use of pharmacogenomics in practice requires that providers are familiar with how to access and use pharmacogenomics resources. Similarly, clinical decision making related to whether to use existing data, whether to order testing, and if data should be used in practice is needed to deliver precision medicine. Pharmacogenomics is applicable to virtually every medical specialty, and nephrologists are well positioned to be implementation leaders.	621	627	ORGAN	kidney	kidney
Pharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized genomic data for the selection of drug targets and the development of precision medicine approaches. Most major pharmaceutical companies routinely collect DNA from clinical trial participants and conduct pharmacogenomic (PGx) studies. However, the implementation of PGx studies during clinical development presents a number of challenges. These challenges include adapting to a constantly changing global regulatory environment, challenges in study design and clinical implementation, and the increasing concerns over patient privacy. Advances in the field of genomics are also providing new opportunities for pharmaceutical companies, including the availability of large genomic databases linked to patient health information, the growing use of polygenic risk scores, and the direct sequencing of clinical trial participants. The Industry Pharmacogenomics Working Group (I-PWG) is an association of pharmaceutical companies actively working in the field of pharmacogenomics. This I-PWG perspective will provide an overview of the steps pharmaceutical companies are taking to address each of these challenges, and the approaches being taken to capitalize on emerging scientific opportunities.	207	210	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have a high mortality rate, and despite the several available therapeutic targets, non-response to antihypertensives remains a common problem. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are important classes of drugs recommended as first-line therapy for several CVDs. However, response to ACEIs and ARBs varies among treated patients. Pharmacogenomics assesses how an individual's genetic characteristics affect their likely response to drug therapy. Currently, numerous studies suggest that genetic polymorphisms may contribute to variability in drug response. Moreover, further studies evaluating gene-gene interactions within signaling pathways in response to antihypertensives might help to unravel potential genetic predictors for antihypertensive response. This review summarizes the pharmacogenetic data for ACEIs and ARBs in patients with CVD, and discusses the potential pharmacogenetics of these classes of antihypertensives in clinical practice. However, replication studies in different populations are needed. In addition, studies that evaluate gene-gene interactions that share signaling pathways in the response to antihypertensive drugs might facilitate the discovery of genetic predictors for antihypertensive response.	0	14	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	Cardiovascular	Cardiovascular
Dementia is an important issue in western societies, and in the following years, this problem will also rise in the developing regions, such as Africa and Asia. The most common types of dementia in adults are Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Vascular Dementia (VaD), of which, AD accounts for more than half of the cases. The most prominent symptom of AD is cognitive impairment, currently treated with four drugs: Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, enhancing cholinergic transmission; as well as memantine, protecting neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity. Despite ongoing efforts, no new drugs in the treatment of AD have been registered for the last ten years, thus multiple studies have been conducted on genetic factors affecting the efficacy of antidementia pharmacotherapy. The researchers investigate the effects of variants in multiple genes, such as ABCB1, ACE, CHAT, CHRNA7, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, NR1I2, NR1I3, POR, PPAR, RXR, SLC22A1/2/5, SLC47A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 and UGT2B7, associated with numerous pathways: the development of pathological proteins, formation and metabolism of acetylcholine, transport, metabolism and excretion of antidementia drugs and transcription factors regulating the expression of genes responsible for metabolism and transport of drugs. The most promising results have been demonstrated for APOE E4, dementia risk variant, BCHE-K, reduced butyrylcholinesterase activity variant, and CYP2D6 UM, ultrarapid hepatic metabolism. Further studies investigate the possibilities of the development of emerging drugs or genetic editing by CRISPR/Cas9 for causative treatment. In conclusion, the pharmacogenetic studies on dementia diseases may improve the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in some patients with beneficial genetic variants, at the same time, identifying the carriers of unfavorable alleles, the potential group of novel approaches to the treatment and prevention of dementia.	249	253	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	Lewy	Lewy

Even though treatment of several types of solid tumors has improved in the past few years with the introduction of molecular targeted agents in the therapeutic armamentarium of the medical oncologist, response rates to these agents are generally modest. Increasing evidence is now revealing that genetic factors are affecting patients' response to these therapeutic agents as well as the frequency and intensity of toxic reactions. Importantly, pharmacogenetic analysis is now required for the administration of several molecular targeted agents in clinical practice. For the vast majority of these agents, however, data remain purely experimental. Herein, we provide an overview of the genetic changes (mutations and polymorphisms) that have been associated with response to treatment with anticancer molecular targeted agents. Special emphasis is given on molecules (monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors) that target critical mediators in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ERBB2/NEU) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) pathways. The true clinical utility of these applications remains to be proven in future prospective, randomized clinical trials in large patient cohorts of all different ethnic backgrounds.	895	903	AMINO_ACID	tyrosine	tyrosine
Salvianolic acids for injection (SAI) is developed from traditional Chinese medicine and approved for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, which is often prescribed for patients in combination with SAI. This present study aimed to assess the effects of SAI on the pharmacogenomics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel, thereby ensuring the safety and efficacy of coadministration. In vitro cytochrome P450 isoenzyme assays were performed in human liver microsomes using LC-MS/MS method to assess the metabolites of CYPs substrates. The effects of SAI on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviors of clopidogrel were investigated in rats. The main pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, and inhibition of platelet aggregation were measured to evaluate the effects of pharmacodynamics. Our study revealed that the clinical dose of SAI has no significant inhibitory effect on clopidogrel-related liver microsome metabolic CYP450 isoenzymes. Moreover, SAI did not affect the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel when rats were administered both single and multiple doses. In pharmacodynamic study, SAI has no effect on platelet aggregation rate, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time of clopidogrel but could significantly prevent the risk of bleeding caused by clopidogrel.	138	153	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	cerebrovascular	cerebrovascular

One of the most challenging problems in the development of new anticancer drugs is the very high attrition rate. The so-called "drug repositioning process" propose to find new therapeutic indications to already approved drugs. For this, new analytic methods are required to optimize the information present in large-scale pharmacogenomics datasets. We analyzed data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia studies. We focused on common cell lines (n = 471), considering the molecular information, and the drug sensitivity for common drugs screened (n = 15). We propose a novel classification based on transcriptomic profiles of cell lines, according to a biological network-driven gene selection process. Our robust molecular classification displays greater homogeneity of drug sensitivity than cancer cell line grouped based on tissue of origin. We then identified significant associations between cell line cluster and drug response robustly found between both datasets. We further demonstrate the relevance of our method using two additional external datasets and distinct sensitivity metrics. Some associations were still found robust, despite cell lines and drug responses' variations. This study defines a robust molecular classification of cancer cell lines that could be used to find new therapeutic indications to known compounds.	871	877	TISSUE	tissue	tissue
Clinical pharmacogenetics, the use of genetic data to guide drug therapy decisions, is beginning to be used for medications commonly prescribed by family physicians. However, clinicians are largely unfamiliar with principles supporting clinical use of this type of data. For example, genetic variability in the cytochrome P450 2D6 drug metabolizing enzyme can alter the clinical effects of some opioid analgesics (e.g., codeine, tramadol), whereas variability in the CYP2C19 enzyme affects the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel. If testing is performed, patients who are ultrarapid or poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 should avoid codeine use (and possibly tramadol, hydrocodone, and oxycodone) because of the potential for increased toxicity or lack of effectiveness. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndromes who are known to be poor metabolizers of CYP2C19 should consider alternate antiplatelet therapy (e.g., ticagrelor, prasugrel). Some guidelines are available that address appropriate drug therapy changes, and others are in development. Additionally, a number of clinical resources are emerging to support family physicians in the use of pharmacogenetics. When used appropriately, pharmacogenetic testing can be a practical tool to optimize drug therapy and avoid medication adverse effects.	794	802	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary	coronary

Methods Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and stage 3 CKD treated with dabigatran 110 or 150 mg have been included in the study. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene (rs1045642 and rs4148738) and CES1 gene (rs2244613). A plasma trough concentration/dose (C/D) ratio was used as a pharmacokinetic index. Results A total of 96 patients aged 51-89 years (median age: 75 years) were evaluated. Patients on a reduced regimen of 110 mg twice a day were older (79.8 vs. 67.9, p < 0.0001) and had lower creatinine clearance (49.7 vs. 62.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.015). Patients with the rs2244613 CC genotype had lower C/D values (70% reduction in the mean C/D vs. AA genotype, p = 0.001). Linear stepwise regression has shown the CKD epidemiology collaboration to be the only significant predictor of C/D among genetic factors and kidney function characteristics. During the median follow-up of 15 months, there were 15 bleedings in 13 patients. Conclusions Polymorphism of CES1 rs2244613 can contribute to the safety of dabigatran in patients with AF and CKD. There was no influence of the aforementioned polymorphisms of ABCB1 on dabigatran trough plasma concentrations and C/D. Kidney function is a mainstay of clinical decision-making on direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dose, and further knowledge should be accumulated on the role of genetic factors.	188	194	ORGAN	kidney	kidney

The combination of budesonide and formoterol administered in one hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) is approved in the United States in two dosage strengths (budesonide/formoterol pMDI 80/4.5 microg x 2 inhalations [160/9 microg] or 160/4.5 microg x 2 inhalations [320/9 microg]) in a fixed-dose, twice-daily regimen for the treatment of patients > or =12 years old with persistent asthma not adequately controlled with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) alone. This article reviews the clinical profile of budesonide/formoterol pMDI in patients with persistent asthma, including information on pharmacogenetics, efficacy, and tolerability. Studies of budesonide/formoterol pMDI in patients with asthma were identified through PubMed and respiratory meeting abstract databases. Budesonide/formoterol pMDI 160/9 microg has shown a rapid onset (within 15 minutes) of clinically significant bronchodilation that is faster than fluticasone propionate/salmeterol dry powder inhaler (DPI) 250/50 microg (within 30 minutes). The efficacy and tolerability profile of budesonide/formoterol pMDI 320/9 microg was similar to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol DPI 250/50 microg and budesonide/formoterol DPI 320/9 microg in adults and adolescents with persistent asthma. Short-term (12-week) and long-term (6- to 12-month) studies have established greater efficacy and similar tolerability of budesonide/formoterol pMDI compared with its monocomponents and placebo in patients with mild/moderate or moderate/severe persistent asthma. Studies evaluating patient-reported outcomes, including health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction with treatment, further support the benefits of budesonide/formoterol pMDI in patients with persistent asthma. In summary, budesonide/formoterol pMDI is an effective, well-tolerated treatment option for patients with persistent asthma for whom ICS/long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist combination therapy is appropriate.	65	82	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	hydrofluoroalkane	hydrofluoroalkane
Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe chronic disorder that represents one of the main causes of disability among young people. To date, no reliable biomarkers are available to inform the diagnosis of BD or clinical response to pharmacological treatment. Studies focused on coding and noncoding transcripts may provide information complementary to genome-wide association studies, allowing to correlate the dynamic evolution of different types of RNAs based on specific cell types and developmental stage with disease development or clinical course. In this narrative review, we summarize findings from human studies that evaluated the potential utility of messenger RNAs and noncoding transcripts, such as microRNAs, circular RNAs and long noncoding RNAs, as peripheral markers of BD and/or response to lithium and other mood stabilizers. The majority of available studies investigated specific targets or pathways, with large heterogeneity in the included type of cells or biofluids. However, a growing number of studies are using hypothesis-free designs, with some studies also integrating data on coding and noncoding RNAs measured in the same participants. Finally, studies conducted in neurons derived from induced-pluripotent stem cells or in brain organoids provide promising preliminary findings supporting the power and utility of these cellular models to investigate the molecular determinants of BD and clinical response.	756	766	TISSUE	peripheral	peripheral
The treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in children has a high clinical success rate, although toxicological complications are frequent, and often result in the interruption of the treatment. Various studies have shown that toxicities resulting from the treatment are influenced by pharmacogenetic variants. Most of this research has focused on relatively homogeneous populations, and the influence of these variants in highly admixed populations, such as that of Brazil, is still poorly understood. The present study investigated the association between pharmacogenetic variants and severe toxicities in pediatric B-cell ALL patients from an admixed population of the Brazilian Amazon. The rs2306283 (of SLCO1B1) mutant allele increased the risk of neurotoxicity threefold, and the homozygous mutant rs9895420 (of ABCC3) genotype was associated with a fivefold increase in protection against severe gastrointestinal toxicity. This indicates that the rs2306283 and rs9895420 polymorphisms may be relevant to the prediction of severe toxicity in pediatric ALL patients.	912	928	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	gastrointestinal	gastrointestinal
Older adults are more susceptible to the prevalence of therapeutic failure and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Recent advances in genomic research have shed light on the crucial role of genetic variants, mainly involving genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters and genes responsible for a compound's mechanism of action, in driving different treatment responses among individuals, in terms of therapeutic efficacy and safety. The interindividual variations of these genes may account for the differences observed in drug efficacy and the appearance of ADRs in elderly people. The advent of whole genome mapping techniques has allowed researchers to begin to characterize the genetic components underlying serious ADRs. The identification and validation of these genetic markers will enable the screening of patients at risk of serious ADRs and to establish personalized treatment regimens.The aim of this review was to provide an update on the recent developments in geriatric pharmacogenetics in clinical practice by reviewing the available evidence in the PubMed database to September 2012. A Pubmed search was performed (years 1999-2012) using the following two search strategies: ('pharmacogenomic' OR 'pharmacogenetic ') AND ('geriatric' or 'elderly ') AND 'adverse drug reactions'; [gene name] AND ('geriatric' or 'elderly ') AND 'adverse drug reactions', in which the gene names were those contained in the Table of Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labels published online by the US Food and Drug Administration ( http://www.fda.gov/drugs/scienceresearch/researchareas/pharmacogenetics/ucm083378.htm ). Reference lists of included original articles and relevant review articles were also screened. The search was limited to studies published in the English language.	615	621	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome
Warfarin-induced bleeding complications and high inter-patient variability are major hindrances to oral anticoagulant therapy. The present study identifies the influence of VKORC1 diplotypes, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 variants on warfarin disposition and dose requirements in Chinese patients (n=107). The study subjects were genotyped for VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 polymorphic variants. Weekly warfarin dose requirements and S-warfarin clearance were stratified by VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 pharmacogenetics. The major VKORC1 diplotypes were H1-H1 (62%), H1-H7 (18%) and H1-H(*)(b) (10%). Warfarin dose requirements were significantly lower in patients with VKORC1 H1-H1 and H1-H(*)(a) diplotypes compared to patients harboring the H1-H7 and H1-H(*)(b) diplotypes (P<0.05). Hepatic tissues with H1-H1 diplotype had significantly lower expression of VKORC1 mRNA compared with liver tissues carrying the H1-H7 and H1-H(*)(b) diplotypes (P=0.006). The percent variability explained by VKORC1 diplotype status was 59.1% while the CYP2C9 genotype status accounted for 6.9% variability in warfarin dose requirements. Patient age and weight were significant covariates accounting for 29% and 8.6% of warfarin dose variability, respectively. The present study shows that VKORC1 diplotype status, CYP2C9 genotype, age and weight are significant covariates, accounting for 73.4% of interindividual variability in warfarin dose requirements among Chinese patients. Translation of these findings into clinical guidelines for warfarin dosing may be required to assess its impact on the safety and efficacy of warfarin.	99	117	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	oral anticoagulant	oral anticoagulant

Advances in the understanding of the pathobiology of childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have led towards risk-oriented treatment regimens and markedly improved survival rates. However, treatment-related toxicities remain a major cause of mortality in developing countries. One of the most common adverse effects of chemotherapy in B-ALL is the hematologic toxicity, which may be related to genetic variants in membrane transporters that are critical for drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. In this study we detected genetic variants present in a selected group genes of the <i>ABC</i> and <i>SLC</i> families that are associated with the risk of high-grade hematologic adverse events due to chemotherapy treatment in a group of Mexican children with B-ALL.	429	437	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	membrane	membrane
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory arthritis that can not only result in permanent joint damage, but is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the mainstay of treatment in RA. DMARDs improve the symptoms of joint pain and swelling, but more importantly, prevent the progression of joint damage. Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line DMARD in RA with over two decades worth of excellent long-term efficacy and safety. However, there is significant variability in patients' response to MTX, both in efficacy and toxicity. Recent advances in genetics, particularly pharmacogenetics, may permit the prediction, a priori, of an individual patient's response to MTX. In this review, we highlight recent published literature on the pharmacogenetics of MTX in RA. Pharmacogenetics may be a useful means of optimising MTX therapy in patients with RA.	101	106	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint	joint

Estrogen hormones play critical roles in the regulation of many tissue functions. The effects of estrogens are primarily mediated by the estrogen receptors (ER) alpha and beta. ERs are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate a complex array of genomic events that orchestrate cellular growth, differentiation and death. Although many factors contribute to their etiology, estrogens are thought to be the primary agents for the development and/or progression of target tissue malignancies. Many of the current modalities for the treatment of estrogen target tissue malignancies are based on agents with diverse pharmacology that alter or prevent ER functions by acting as estrogen competitors. Although these compounds have been successfully used in clinical settings, the efficacy of treatment shows variability. An increasing body of evidence implicates ERalpha polymorphisms as one of the contributory factors for differential responses to estrogen competitors. This review aims to highlight the recent findings on polymorphisms of the lately identified ERbeta in order to provide a functional perspective with potential pharmacogenomic implications.	64	70	TISSUE	tissue	tissue
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are important contributors to interindividual differences in drug metabolism leading to adverse drug reactions. Despite their extensive characterization and importance in pharmacogenetics of clinical drugs, the structural basis of CYP polymorphisms has remained scant. Here we report the crystal structures of human CYP2C9 and its polymorphic variants, *3 (I359L) and *30 (A477T), with an antihypertensive drug losartan. The structures show distinct interaction and occupation of losartan in the active site, the access channel, and the peripheral binding site. The I359L substitution located far from the active site remarkably altered the residue side chains near the active site and the access channel, whereas the T477 substitution illustrated hydrogen-bonding interaction with the reoriented side chain of Q214. The results yield structural insights into the reduced catalytic activity of the CYP2C9 variants and have important implications for understanding genetic polymorphisms in CYP-mediated drug metabolism.	620	630	TISSUE	peripheral	peripheral

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious adverse effect of long-term antipsychotic use. Because of genetic susceptibility for developing TD and because it is difficult to predict and prevent its development prior to or during the early stages of medication, pharmacogenetic research of TD is important. Additionally, these studies enhance our knowledge of the genetic mechanisms underlying abnormal dyskinetic movements, such as Parkinson's disease. However, the pathophysiology of TD remains unclear. The oxidative stress hypothesis of TD is one of the possible pathophysiologic models for TD. Preclinical and clinical studies of the oxidative stress hypothesis of TD indicate that neurotoxic free radical production is likely a consequence of antipsychotic medication and is related to the occurrence of TD. Several studies on TD have focused on examining the genes involved in oxidative stress. Among them, manganese superoxide dismutase gene Ala-9Val polymorphisms show a relatively consistent association with TD susceptibility, although not all studies support this. Numerous pharmacogenetic studies have found a positive relationship between TD and oxidative stress based on genes involved in the antioxidant defense mechanism, dopamine turnover and metabolism, and other antioxidants such as estrogen and melatonin. However, many of the positive findings have not been replicated. We expect that more research will be needed to address these issues.	425	436	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	Parkinson's	Parkinson's
Recent advances in genomic medicine have contributed to the acceleration of our understanding regarding the pathogenesis of dementia, improving diagnostic accuracy with the introduction of novel biomarkers and personalizing therapeutics with the incorporation of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic procedures to drug development and clinical practice. Most neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), share some common features, such as a genomic background in which hundreds of genes might be involved, genome-environment interactions, complex pathogenic pathways, poor therapeutic outcomes and chronic disability. The main aim of a cost-effective treatment is to halt disease progression via modification of the functional cascade involving AD genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Unfortunately, the drugs available for the treatment of dementia are not cost effective. The pharmacological treatment of dementia accounts for 10-20% of direct costs, and fewer than 20% of the patients are moderate responders to conventional drugs, some of which may cause important adverse drug reactions. Future antidementia drugs must address the complex pathogenic niche of the disease from a multifactorial perspective. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic factors may account for 60-90% of drug variability in drug disposition and pharmacodynamics. In addition to antidementia drugs, patients with AD or with other forms of dementia need concomitant medications for the treatment of diverse disorders of the CNS associated with progressive brain dysfunction. Approximately 60-80% of drugs acting on the CNS are metabolized via enzymes of the CYP gene superfamily, and 10-20% of Caucasians are carriers of defective CYP2D6 polymorphic variants that alter the metabolism of many psychotropic agents. Only 26% of the patients are pure extensive metabolizers for the trigenic cluster integrated by allelic variants of the CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 in combination. Although many genes have been suggested to be associated with AD, with the exception of APOE, most polymorphic variants of potential risk exhibit a very weak association with AD. APOE-4/4 carriers exhibit a dramatic biological disadvantage in comparison with other genotypes, and AD patients harboring this homozygous condition are the worst responders to conventional drugs. The incorporation of pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic protocols into AD research and clinical practice can foster the optimization of therapeutics by helping to develop cost-effective biopharmaceuticals and improving drug efficacy and safety.	1538	1541	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS	CNS

In addition to antidementia drugs, patients with AD or with other forms of dementia need concomitant medications for the treatment of diverse disorders of the CNS associated with progressive brain dysfunction. Approximately 60-80% of drugs acting on the CNS are metabolized via enzymes of the CYP gene superfamily, and 10-20% of Caucasians are carriers of defective CYP2D6 polymorphic variants that alter the metabolism of many psychotropic agents. Only 26% of the patients are pure extensive metabolizers for the trigenic cluster integrated by allelic variants of the CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 in combination. Although many genes have been suggested to be associated with AD, with the exception of APOE, most polymorphic variants of potential risk exhibit a very weak association with AD. APOE-4/4 carriers exhibit a dramatic biological disadvantage in comparison with other genotypes, and AD patients harboring this homozygous condition are the worst responders to conventional drugs. The incorporation of pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic protocols into AD research and clinical practice can foster the optimization of therapeutics by helping to develop cost-effective biopharmaceuticals and improving drug efficacy and safety.	1570	1575	ORGAN	brain	brain
Recent advances in genomic medicine have contributed to the acceleration of our understanding regarding the pathogenesis of dementia, improving diagnostic accuracy with the introduction of novel biomarkers and personalizing therapeutics with the incorporation of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic procedures to drug development and clinical practice. Most neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), share some common features, such as a genomic background in which hundreds of genes might be involved, genome-environment interactions, complex pathogenic pathways, poor therapeutic outcomes and chronic disability. The main aim of a cost-effective treatment is to halt disease progression via modification of the functional cascade involving AD genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Unfortunately, the drugs available for the treatment of dementia are not cost effective. The pharmacological treatment of dementia accounts for 10-20% of direct costs, and fewer than 20% of the patients are moderate responders to conventional drugs, some of which may cause important adverse drug reactions. Future antidementia drugs must address the complex pathogenic niche of the disease from a multifactorial perspective. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic factors may account for 60-90% of drug variability in drug disposition and pharmacodynamics.

The cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a cytochrome P450 enzyme involved in the oxidative biotransformation of the xenobiotics, carcinogens and various clinically important drugs. Patients are evaluated in three sub-groups of extensive (EM), intermediate (IM) and poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes due to their drug-metabolising ability for the target CYP2D6 gene. Colchicine non-responsive FMF patients were prospectively genotyped for the major CYP2D6 alleles in the current study. Major CYP2D6 alleles of *1, *3, *4, *5, and *6 were genotyped for 30 responsive and 60 non-responsive FMF patients by multiplex PCR-based reverse-hybridization StripAssay and real-time PCR methods. DNA banks isolated from blood-EDTA were retrospectively used in the current patients and results were compared statistically. Increased CYP2D6 *4 and *6 allele frequencies were highly detected in the colchicine non-responsive FMF patients when compared to the responsive group. Results showed the frequencies of major CYP2D6 *1(wild), *3(2637A > delA), *4(G1934A), *5(total gene deletion) and *6(1707T del) alleles in 0.550, 0.042, 0.158, 0.025 and 0.225 for non-responder and 0.880 and 0.120 (CYP2D6*1 and *4) for the responder groups, respectively. Despite small sample size, this study suggests that there is an association between CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*6 alleles and drug intoxicants in colchicine non-responder FMF patients.	678	681	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) rank as one of the top 10 leading causes of death and illness in developed countries. ADRs show differential features depending upon genotype, age, sex, race, pathology, drug category, route of administration, and drug-drug interactions. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) provides the physician effective clues for optimizing drug efficacy and safety in major problems of health such as cardiovascular disease and associated disorders, cancer and brain disorders. Important aspects to be considered are also the impact of immunopharmacogenomics in cutaneous ADRs as well as the influence of genomic factors associated with COVID-19 and vaccination strategies. Major limitations for the routine use of PGx procedures for ADRs prevention are the lack of education and training in physicians and pharmacists, poor characterization of drug-related PGx, unspecific biomarkers of drug efficacy and toxicity, cost-effectiveness, administrative problems in health organizations, and insufficient regulation for the generalized use of PGx in the clinical setting. The implementation of PGx requires: (i) education of physicians and all other parties involved in the use and benefits of PGx; (ii) prospective studies to demonstrate the benefits of PGx genotyping; (iii) standardization of PGx procedures and development of clinical guidelines; (iv) NGS and microarrays to cover genes with high PGx potential; and (v) new regulations for PGx-related drug development and PGx drug labelling.	406	428	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	cardiovascular disease	cardiovascular disease

In pediatric age and particularly in newborn infants the drug efficacy and safety are influenced by the growth and development on drug Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME). Thanks to the fast development of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics, the drug therapy promises to be adapted to the genetic profile of the individual, reducing considerably the side effects of drugs and increasing their efficacy. Interindividual variability in drug response is well known in both adults and children. Such a variability is multifactorial considering both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Drug distribution in the neonate is influenced by a variety of age-dependent factors as a total body water content and distribution variations, role of drug transporters, blood/tissue protein binding, blood and tissue pH and perfusion. The development of enzymes involved in human metabolism were classified in 3 categories: 1) those expressed during the whole or part of the fetal period, but silenced or expressed at low levels within 1-2 years after birth; 2) those expressed at relatively constant levels throughout fetal development, but increased to some extent postnatally; and 3) those whose onset of expression can occur in the third trimester, but substantial increase is noted in the first 1-2 years after birth. Besides this intrinsic aspects influencing pharmacokinetics during the neonatal period there are other important events such as inborn or acquired diseases, environment and finally pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Thousands of deaths every years are caused by fatal drug reactions; among the potential causes there are not only the severity of the disease being treated, drug interactions, nutritional status, renal and liver functions, but also the inherited differences in drug metabolism and genetic polymorphism. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among pediatric patients have been shown to be three times more frequent than in adults. On August 2010 The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) addressed patient safety issues in the NICU, recognizing that to understand and prevent adverse events, systematic research and education in safety issues needed. From all these concepts in terms of ADME, pharmacogenetics (relative to a single gene) and pharmacogenomics (relative to many genes) it is becoming more evident the perspective of the new concept of individualized medicine. The goal of this should be to identify which group of patients responds positively, which patients are nonresponders and who experiences adverse reaction for the same drug and dose. The interindividual variability in response to any drug is mostly dependent on DNA sequence variations across the human genome, the haplotype map (HAPMAP). At present there is still a big distance beween the knowledge in genetic and the practical application to model the drug profile to the genetic/genomic profile of the single patient. In the neonatal period the effects of growth in the pharmacodynamic, processes can help optimizing the dosage of neonatal frequently used medicines, thereby, minimizing their toxicity and increasing their efficacy. It should be useful to create accurate dosage adjustments according to the week of development.	804	809	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood	blood

Chronic calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-induced nephrotoxicity is associated with prolonged use of cyclosporine and tacrolimus and has been observed after all types of transplantation, as well as during treatment of autoimmune disease. Extensive alterations in the renal architecture including glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis may lead to end-stage renal failure. Increasing evidence shows that pharmacogenetic factors explain part of the between-patient differences in susceptibility to developing CNI-induced nephrotoxicity. In this paper this evidence is reviewed, with special emphasis on the role of genetic factors influencing metabolism and transportation of CNIs in both acceptor and donor.	261	279	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	renal architecture	renal architecture

<b>Background:</b> Clopidogrel is frequently used in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), but its efficacy is hampered by inter-individual variability, due to genetic differences associated with clopidogrel metabolism. We conducted this randomized controlled trial to validate whether the personalized antiplatelet therapy based on clopidogrel pharmacogenomics and clinical characteristics leads to better clinical outcomes compared with standard treatment. <b>Methods:</b> Patients were randomly divided into the standard group or pharmacogenetic group, in which the pharmacogenetic group required the detection of the genotyping of <i>CYP2C19*2</i>, <i>CYP2C19*3</i>, and <i>CYP2C19*17</i>. Patients were followed up for 90 days for the primary efficacy endpoint of new stroke events, secondary efficacy endpoint of individual or composite outcomes of the new clinical vascular events, and the incidence of disability. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. <b>Results:</b> A total of 650 patients underwent randomization, among which 325 were in the pharmacogenomics group while 325 were in the standard group. Our study found after a 90-day follow-up, the risk of stroke and composite vascular events in the pharmacogenomics group was lower than that in the standard group. The incidence of disability significantly decreased in the pharmacogenomics group. In addition, no statistically significant differences were observed in bleeding events between the two groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> The present study demonstrates that personalized antiplatelet therapy guided by clopidogrel pharmacogenomics and clinical characteristics can significantly improve the net clinical benefit of ischemic stroke or TIA patients during the 90-day treatment period without increasing bleeding risk.	900	908	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	vascular	vascular

Inter-individual variation in drug response and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are well known in medicine. This individual variation in drug response could be at least, in part, due to genetic diversity among individuals. Although substantial studies that connect genetic variants to inter-individual variation in drug response have been documented in several diseases such as cancer and heart diseases, such studies are slowly progressing in ophthalmology. In recent years, advancement in technologies has led to the identification of genes associated with several eye disorders. At the same time, some small-scale studies have demonstrated the association of various genotypes or haplotypes with response to drug therapies. However, its integration into clinical practice in ophthalmology is not possible at present. This is because there are many challenging questions that remain to be addressed. For instance, in the case of complex disorders a single gene study is not enough. Multiple genes, environmental factors, multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and rare or low frequency variants may contribute to the disease and they must be considered. The functional aspects of many genetic variants are not known. This raises questions of their biological importance and their clinical usefulness. In addition, there are legal, ethical, and social issues that need to be regulated. Moreover, physicians and patients must be educated about the limitation and sensitivity of genetic testing. At present pharmacogenetic studies in ophthalmology are still in their infancy and do not suggest that a pharmacogenetic basis of drug development in ophthalmology is a concept that can yield immediate results, but can become a reality in the future. In this article an attempt has been made to summarize some of the recent small-scale pharmacogenetic studies on two major eye disorders, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.	387	392	ORGAN	heart	heart

In this article an attempt has been made to summarize some of the recent small-scale pharmacogenetic studies on two major eye disorders, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.	1876	1879	ORGAN	eye	eye
Inter-individual variation in drug response and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are well known in medicine. This individual variation in drug response could be at least, in part, due to genetic diversity among individuals. Although substantial studies that connect genetic variants to inter-individual variation in drug response have been documented in several diseases such as cancer and heart diseases, such studies are slowly progressing in ophthalmology. In recent years, advancement in technologies has led to the identification of genes associated with several eye disorders. At the same time, some small-scale studies have demonstrated the association of various genotypes or haplotypes with response to drug therapies. However, its integration into clinical practice in ophthalmology is not possible at present. This is because there are many challenging questions that remain to be addressed. For instance, in the case of complex disorders a single gene study is not enough. Multiple genes, environmental factors, multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and rare or low frequency variants may contribute to the disease and they must be considered. The functional aspects of many genetic variants are not known. This raises questions of their biological importance and their clinical usefulness. In addition, there are legal, ethical, and social issues that need to be regulated. Moreover, physicians and patients must be educated about the limitation and sensitivity of genetic testing.

In this report, we present a case study of how pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics can be useful to characterize safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in early phase new drug development clinical trials. During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p ＜ 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.	348	354	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma	plasma

Warfarin has a long record of safe and effective clinical use, and it remains one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic conditions even in the era of direct oral anticoagulants. To address its large interindividual variability and narrow therapeutic window, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium has recommended using pharmacogenetic dosing algorithms, such as the ones developed by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC) and by Gage et al, to dose warfarin when genotype information is available. In China, dosing algorithms based on local patient populations have been developed and evaluated for predictive accuracy of warfarin maintenance doses. In this study, percentage deviations of doses predicted by 15 Chinese dosing algorithms from that by IWPC and Gage algorithms were systematically evaluated to understand the differences between Chinese and Western algorithms. In general, dose predictions by Chinese dosing algorithms tended to be lower than those predicted by IWPC or Gage algorithms for the most prevalent VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes in the Chinese population. The extent of negative prediction deviation appeared to be largest in the younger age group with smaller body weight. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that Asians have a higher sensitivity to warfarin and require lower doses than Western populations.	208	227	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral anticoagulants	oral anticoagulants

The major challenges that delay the implementation of pharmacogenomics based clinical practice in the developing countries, primarily the low- and middle-income countries need to be recognized. This review was conducted to systematically review evidence of the cost-effectiveness for the conduct of pharmacogenomics testing in the developing countries. Studies that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics testing in the developing countries as defined by the United Nations were included in this study. Twenty-seven articles met the criteria. Pharmacogenomics effectiveness were evaluated for drugs used in the treatment of cancers, cardiovascular diseases and severe cutaneous adverse reactions in gout and epilepsy. Most studies had reported pharmacogenomics testing to be cost-effective (cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and tuberculosis) and economic models were evaluated from multiple perspectives, different cost categories and time horizons. Additionally, most studies used a single gene, rather than a gene panel for the pharmacogenomics testing. Genotyping cost and frequency of risk alleles in the populations influence the cost-effectiveness outcome. Further studies are warranted to examine the clinical and economic validity of pharmacogenomics testing in the developing countries.	647	661	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular	cardiovascular

Naltrexone, one of four FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence, has shown moderate efficacy in clinical trials. Pharmacogenetic effects have been reported such that allelic variation at the gene encoding the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1, rs1799971) predicts naltrexone-induced blunting of the positively reinforcing effects of alcohol. However, naltrexone also binds, albeit to a lesser degree, to kappa and delta opioid receptors in the brain. This alternate binding presents the possibility that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the kappa and delta opioid receptor (OPRK1 and OPRD1) genes may contribute to naltrexone pharmacogenetics. Therefore, the goal of this exploratory study was to re-examine data from a double-blind placebo controlled laboratory trial of naltrexone for pharmacogenetic effects at kappa and delta opioid receptor tag SNPs. Participants were 40 heavy drinkers (12 female) who underwent an intravenous alcohol challenge paradigm after receiving naltrexone (50mg) or placebo in randomized and crossover fashion. Dependent variables were self-reported alcohol-induced stimulation, sedation, and craving. Multilevel models revealed a significant Naltrexone×OPRK1 Genotype (rs997917) interaction predicting alcohol-induced sedation, such that TT homozygotes reported lower naltrexone-induced alcohol sedation as compared to carriers of the C allele. Moreover, there was a significant Naltrexone×OPRD1 Genotype (rs4654327) interaction predicting alcohol-induced stimulation and craving, such that carriers of the A allele at this locus reported greater naltrexone-induced blunting of alcohol stimulation and alcohol craving compared to GG homozygotes. These findings suggest that additional pharmacogenetic effects in the opioid receptor system may account for individual differences in response to naltrexone in the human laboratory.	450	455	ORGAN	brain	brain

A large number of women receive codeine for obstetric pain while breastfeeding. Following a case of fatal opioid poisoning in a breastfed neonate whose codeine prescribed mother was a CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer (UM), we examined characteristics of mothers and infants with or without signs of central nervous system (CNS) depression following codeine exposure while breastfeeding in a case-control study. Mothers of symptomatic infants (n = 17) consumed a mean 59% higher codeine dose than mothers of asymptomatic infants (n = 55) (1.62 (0.79) mg/kg/day vs. 1.02 (0.54) mg/kg/day; P = 0.004). There was 71% concordance between maternal and neonatal CNS depression. Two mothers whose infants exhibited severe neonatal toxicity were CYP2D6 UMs and of the UGT2B7*2/*2 genotype. There may be a dose-response relationship between maternal codeine use and neonatal toxicity, and strong concordance between maternal-infant CNS depressive symptoms. Breastfed infants of mothers who are CYP2D6 UMs combined with the UGT2B7*2/*2 are at increased risk of potentially life-threatening CNS depression.	296	318	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system	central nervous system

Although current literature indicates both a clinical and a cost-effective benefit of routine genotype-guided treatment of patients treated with clopidogrel, this strategy is not recommended in guidelines. In cardiology, but also in neurology and vascular surgery, the current scientific evidence for this is still insufficient. Nevertheless, the role of pharmacogenetics will gain importance in today's medical world, where the demand for personalised medicine is on the rise. The implementation of genotyping in the clinic will nonetheless be a practical challenge due to a lack of clarity about who will bear the associated costs. In patients with coronary artery disease and a higher bleeding risk, it is valuable to determine the CYP2C19 genotype prior to treatment with clopidogrel. Pending further studies, we recommend that specialists prescribing clopidogrel should determine the CYP2C19 genotype in patients at high risk of recurrent ischemic events.	247	255	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	vascular	vascular

Migraine is a multidimensional disease affecting a large portion of the human population presenting with a variety of symptoms. In the era of personalized medicine, successful migraine treatment presents a challenge, as several studies have shown the impact of a patient's genetic profile on therapy response. However, with the emergence of contemporary treatment options, there is promise for improved outcomes. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus, in order to obtain studies investigating the impact of genetic factors on migraine therapy outcome. Overall, 23 studies were included in the current review, exhibiting diversity in the treatments used and the genetic variants investigated. Divergent genes were assessed for each category of migraine treatment. Several genetic factors were identified to contribute to the heterogeneous response to treatment. SNPs related to pharmacodynamic receptors, pharmacogenetics and migraine susceptibility loci were the most investigated variants, revealing some interesting significant results. To date, various associations have been recorded correlating the impact of genetic factors on migraine treatment responses. More extensive research needs to take place with the aim of shedding light on the labyrinthine effects of genetic variations on migraine treatment, and, consequently, these findings can promptly affect migraine treatment and improve migraine patients' life quality in the vision of precise medicine.	1262	1274	TISSUE	labyrinthine	labyrinthine
The primary aim of the present study was to assess the possible associations between dopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic system-related genes and adverse events after antipsychotic treatment in paranoid schizophrenia patients. The second aim of the study was to compare the intensity of these symptoms between atypical (ziprasidone and olanzapine) and typical (perazine) antipsychotic drugs. One-hundred and ninety-one Polish patients suffering from paranoid schizophrenia were genotyped for polymorphisms of DRD2, DAT1, COMT, MAOA, SERT, 5HT2A, and GRIK3. The patients were randomized to treatment with perazine, olanzapine or ziprasidone monotherapy for 3 months. The intensity of side effects (changes in body weights and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)) was measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. After 3 months of therapy, the weight increase was the greatest in the group treated with olanzapine and the least in the group treated with ziprasidone. None of the examined gene polymorphisms was associated with the body weight changes. Perazine treatment was associated with the significantly highest intensity of EPS. None of the examined polymorphisms was associated with the changes in extrapyramidal adverse events after antipsychotic treatment. The selected polymorphisms are not primarily involved in changes in body weights and EPS related to antipsychotic treatment in paranoid schizophrenia patients.	1056	1060	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	body	body

Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are NAD⁺-dependent protein deacetylases/ADP ribosyltransferases with important roles in chromatin silencing, cell cycle regulation, cellular differentiation, cellular stress response, metabolism and aging. Sirtuins are components of the epigenetic machinery, which is disturbed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing to AD pathogenesis.

Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are NAD⁺-dependent protein deacetylases/ADP ribosyltransferases with important roles in chromatin silencing, cell cycle regulation, cellular differentiation, cellular stress response, metabolism and aging. Sirtuins are components of the epigenetic machinery, which is disturbed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing to AD pathogenesis.

We summarize and discuss the studies presented at the congress of the American Association of Gastroenterology (Digestive Disease Week) that, in our opinion, are of greatest interest. Both clinically and physiopathologically, functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are highly complex. A single cause is unlikely to explain symptoms as heterogeneous as those of functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Therefore, it is easier (and more useful) to try to understand functional GI disorders using a bio-psycho-social model. Moreover, data supporting the combined importance of genetic, organic and psychological factors in the onset and persistence of functional GI disorders are increasingly convincing. This year, new data have been provided on pharmacogenetics in gastroparesis, on microinflammation or alterations in the modulation of somatic and visceral sensitivity in functional dyspepsia, and on the impact of psychological factors in IBS. From the therapeutic point of view, further information has been provided on the role of probiotics, the antinociceptive effect of linaclotide (demonstrated in several studies presented this year), and on the high efficacy of hypnotherapy in patients with IBS. Finally, data on the clinical management of patients with constipation due to pelvic floor dyssynergia and on the safety and efficacy of prucalopride in patients with severe constipation were also of interest.	376	385	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	dyspepsia	dyspepsia

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been successfully developed for the prediction of human diseases and complex traits in the past years. For drug response prediction in randomized clinical trials, a common practice is to apply PRS built from a disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) directly to a corresponding pharmacogenomics (PGx) setting. Here, we show that such an approach relies on stringent assumptions about the prognostic and predictive effects of the selected genetic variants. We propose a shift from disease PRS to PGx PRS approaches by simultaneously modeling both the prognostic and predictive effects and further make this shift possible by developing a series of PRS-PGx methods, including a novel Bayesian regression approach (PRS-PGx-Bayes). Simulation studies show that PRS-PGx methods generally outperform the disease PRS methods and PRS-PGx-Bayes is superior to all other PRS-PGx methods. We further apply the PRS-PGx methods to PGx GWAS data from a large cardiovascular randomized clinical trial (IMPROVE-IT) to predict treatment related LDL cholesterol reduction. The results demonstrate substantial improvement of PRS-PGx-Bayes in both prediction accuracy and the capability of capturing the treatment-specific predictive effects while compared with the disease PRS approaches.	1066	1081	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	LDL cholesterol	LDL cholesterol

Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of the pyrimidine bases uracil, thymine and the antineoplastic agent 5-fluorouracil. Genetic variations in the gene encoding DPD (DPYD) have emerged as predictive risk alleles for 5FU-associated toxicity. Here we report an in-depth analysis of genetic variants in DPYD and their consequences for DPD activity and pyrimidine metabolites in 100 Dutch healthy volunteers. 34 SNPs were detected in DPYD and 15 SNPs were associated with altered plasma concentrations of pyrimidine metabolites. DPD activity was significantly associated with the plasma concentrations of uracil, the presence of a specific DPYD mutation (c.1905+1G>A) and the combined presence of three risk variants in DPYD (c.1905+1G>A, c.1129-5923C>G, c.2846A>T), but not with an altered uracil/dihydrouracil (U/UH2) ratio. Various haplotypes were associated with different DPD activities (haplotype D3, a decreased DPD activity; haplotype F2, an increased DPD activity). Functional analysis of eight recombinant mutant DPD enzymes showed a reduced DPD activity, ranging from 35% to 84% of the wild-type enzyme. Analysis of a DPD homology model indicated that the structural effect of the novel p.G401R mutation is most likely minor. The clinical relevance of the p.D949V mutation was demonstrated in a cancer patient heterozygous for the c.2846A>T mutation and a novel nonsense mutation c.1681C>T (p.R561X), experiencing severe grade IV toxicity. Our studies showed that the endogenous levels of uracil and the U/UH2 ratio are poor predictors of an impaired DPD activity. Loading studies with uracil to identify patients with a DPD deficiency warrants further investigation.	636	642	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma	plasma
Antithrombotic therapy, including anticoagulants as well as antiplatelet drugs, is an important component in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Variability in response to such medications, of which pharmacogenetic response is a major source, can decrease or enhance the benefits expected. This review is a comprehensive assessment of the literature published to date on the effects of genetic polymorphisms on the actions of a variety of antithrombotic medications, including warfarin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, and aspirin. Literature evaluating surrogate markers in addition to the impact of pharmacogenetics on clinical outcomes has been reviewed. The results of the studies are conflicting as to what degree pharmacogenetics will affect medication management in cardiovascular disease. Additional research is necessary to discover, characterize, and prospectively evaluate genetic and non-genetic factors that impact antithrombotic treatment in order to maximize the effectiveness and limit the harmful effects of these valuable agents.	126	140	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular	cardiovascular

<b>Case introduction:</b> In this work we present a female infant patient with epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS). Although many pharmacological schemes were attempted, she developed an encephalopathy with poor response to antiepileptic drugs and progressive cerebral dysfunction. <b>Aim:</b> To present the pharmacological response and therapeutic drug monitoring of a paediatric patient with a severe encephalopathy carrying a genetic variant in KCNT1 gene, whose identification led to include quinidine (QND) in the treatment regimen as an antiepileptic drug. <b>Case report:</b> Patient showed slow rhythmic activity (theta range) over left occipital areas with temporal propagation and oculo-clonic focal seizures and without tonic spasms three months after birth. At the age of 18 months showed severe impairments of motor and intellectual function with poor eye contact. When the patient was 4 years old, a genetic variant in the exon 24 of the KCNT1 gene was found. This led to the diagnosis of EIMFS. Due to antiepileptic treatment failed to control seizures, QND a KCNT1 blocker, was introduced as a therapeutic alternative besides topiramate (200 mg/day) and nitrazepam (2 mg/day). Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of QND plasma levels needed to be implemented to establish individual therapeutic range and avoid toxicity. TDM for dose adjustment was performed to establish the individual therapeutic range of the patient. Seizures were under control with QND levels above 1.5 mcg/ml (65-70 mg/kg q. i.d). In addition, QND levels higher than 4.0 mcg/ml, were related to higher risk of suffering arrhythmia due to prolongation of QT segment. Despite initial intention to withdrawal topiramate completely, QND was no longer effective by itself and failed to maintain seizures control. Due to this necessary interaction between quinidine and topiramate, topiramate was stablished in a maintenance dose of 40 mg/day. <b>Conclusion:</b> The implementation of Precision Medicine by using tools such as Next Generation Sequencing and TDM led to diagnose and select a targeted therapy for the treatment of a KCNT1-related epilepsy in a patient presented with EIMFS in early infancy and poor response to antiepileptic drugs. QND an old antiarrhythmic drug, due to its activity as KCNT1 channel blocker, associated to topiramate resulted in seizures control. Due to high variability observed in QND levels, TDM and pharmacokinetic characterization allowed to optimize drug regimen to maintain QND concentration between the individual therapeutic range and diminish toxicity.	282	290	ORGAN	cerebral	cerebral

CYP2C9 is the most abundant CYP2C subfamily enzyme in human liver and the most important contributor from this subfamily to drug metabolism. Polymorphisms resulting in decreased enzyme activity are common in the <i>CYP2C9</i> gene and this, combined with narrow therapeutic indices for several key drug substrates, results in some important issues relating to drug safety and efficacy. CYP2C9 substrate selectivity is detailed and, based on crystal structures for the enzyme, we describe how CYP2C9 catalyzes these reactions. Factors relevant to clinical response to CYP2C9 substrates including inhibition, induction and genetic polymorphism are discussed in detail. In particular, we consider the issue of ethnic variation in pattern and frequency of genetic polymorphisms and clinical implications. Warfarin is the most well studied CYP2C9 substrate; recent work on use of dosing algorithms that include CYP2C9 genotype to improve patient safety during initiation of warfarin dosing are reviewed and prospects for their clinical implementation considered. Finally, we discuss a novel approach to cataloging the functional capabilities of rare 'variants of uncertain significance', which are increasingly detected as more exome and genome sequencing of diverse populations is conducted.	1233	1239	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome
Previous reports including genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have described associations of serum lipids with genomic variations. In the present study, we examined the association of ∼2.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 3041 Japanese healthy volunteers obtained from the Japan Pharmacogenomics Data Science Consortium (JPDSC) database with serum lipids. We confirmed the previously reported associations of 14 SNPs in 5 regions for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 23 SNPs in 12 regions for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 16 SNPs in 6 regions for triglyceride and 5 SNPs in 1 region for phospholipid. Furthermore, we identified 16 possible novel candidate genes associated with LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides, where SNPs had P-values of <1 × 10(-5). Further replication analyses of these genes with Korean data revealed significant associations of SNPs located within the PCSK7 gene and triglyceride (Pmeta=7.98 × 10(-9) and 1.91 × 10(-8) for rs508487 and rs236911, respectively). These associations remained significant even by the conditional analysis adjusting for three neighboring variations associated with triglyceride. Our present data suggest that PCSK7 as well as PCSK9 may be associated with lipids, especially triglyceride, and may serve as a candidate for a new drug target to treat lipid abnormality syndromes.	98	110	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum lipids	serum lipids

Membrane transporters are important determinants of drug bioavailability. Their expression and activity affect the intracellular drug concentration in leukemic cells impacting response to therapy. Pharmacogenomics represents genetic markers that reflect allele arrangement of genes encoding drug transporters associated with treatment response. In previous work, we identified SNP rs460089 located in the promotor of SLC22A4 gene encoding imatinib transporter OCTN1 as influential on response of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib. Patients with rs460089-GC pharmacogenotype had significantly superior response to first-line imatinib treatment compared to patients with rs460089-GG. This study investigated whether pharmacogenotypes of rs460089 are associated with sustainability of treatment-free remission (TFR) in patients from the EUROpean Stop Kinase Inhibitor (EURO-SKI) trial. In the learning sample, 176 patients showed a significantly higher 6-month probability of molecular relapse free survival (MRFS) in patients with GC genotype (73%, 95% CI: 60-82%) compared to patients with GG (51%, 95% CI: 41-61%). Also over time, patients with GC genotype had significantly higher MRFS probabilities compared with patients with GG (HR: 0.474, 95% CI: 0.280-0.802, p = 0.0054). Both results were validated with data on 93 patients from the Polish STOP imatinib study. In multiple regression models, in addition to the investigated genotype, duration of TKI therapy (EURO-SKI trial) and duration of deep molecular response (Polish study) were identified as independent prognostic factors. The SNP rs460089 was found as an independent predictor of TFR.	0	8	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	Membrane	Membrane

Precise tacrolimus treatment in transplanted patients is achieved in the clinical setting by performing therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and consequently adjusting therapy. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the variability in tacrolimus blood levels throughout 2 years of observation in 75 transplanted patients and to investigate if tacrolimus blood levels correlate with presence of genetic polymorphisms, thus modifying tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. CYP3A5*1 (G6986A), CYP3A4*1B (A392G), CYP3A4*22, ABCB1 (C3435T; C1236T; G2677A/T), SLCO1B1 (T521C), polymorphisms were analyzed. Based on the effect of their genotypes, patients were stratified into 5 groups: (1) reduced tacrolimus metabolism (RM), (2) increased metabolism (IM), (3) transporters polymorphisms (TM), (4) metabolism and transporter polymorphisms (AM) and (5) no mutations (Wild Type, WT). The percentage of the samples out of therapeutic range was significantly higher in the IM group than in the WT group (<i>p</i> = 0.001), as well as compared to the TM group (<i>p</i> = 0.004).

RM pattern (<i>p</i> = 0.006) was inversely related to the administered dose. Therefore, genotyping could become a standard practice before tacrolimus prescription thus decreasing side effects, increasing efficacy and reducing the economic burden for the national health system.	257	262	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	blood	blood
Precise tacrolimus treatment in transplanted patients is achieved in the clinical setting by performing therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and consequently adjusting therapy. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the variability in tacrolimus blood levels throughout 2 years of observation in 75 transplanted patients and to investigate if tacrolimus blood levels correlate with presence of genetic polymorphisms, thus modifying tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. CYP3A5*1 (G6986A), CYP3A4*1B (A392G), CYP3A4*22, ABCB1 (C3435T; C1236T; G2677A/T), SLCO1B1 (T521C), polymorphisms were analyzed. Based on the effect of their genotypes, patients were stratified into 5 groups: (1) reduced tacrolimus metabolism (RM), (2) increased metabolism (IM), (3) transporters polymorphisms (TM), (4) metabolism and transporter polymorphisms (AM) and (5) no mutations (Wild Type, WT). The percentage of the samples out of therapeutic range was significantly higher in the IM group than in the WT group (<i>p</i> = 0.001), as well as compared to the TM group (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Only IM pattern (<i>p</i> = 0.015) resulted as an independent predictor of number of tacrolimus blood levels out of therapeutic range. RM pattern (<i>p</i> = 0.006) was inversely related to the administered dose.

CellMinerCDB provides a web-based resource (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb/) for integrating multiple forms of pharmacological and genomic analyses, and unifying the richest cancer cell line datasets (the NCI-60, NCI-SCLC, Sanger/MGH GDSC, and Broad CCLE/CTRP). CellMinerCDB enables data queries for genomics and gene regulatory network analyses, and exploration of pharmacogenomic determinants and drug signatures. It leverages overlaps of cell lines and drugs across databases to examine reproducibility and expand pathway analyses. We illustrate the value of CellMinerCDB for elucidating gene expression determinants, such as DNA methylation and copy number variations, and highlight complexities in assessing mutational burden. We demonstrate the value of CellMinerCDB in selecting drugs with reproducible activity, expand on the dominant role of SLFN11 for drug response, and present novel response determinants and genomic signatures for topoisomerase inhibitors and schweinfurthins. We also introduce LIX1L as a gene associated with mesenchymal signature and regulation of cellular migration and invasiveness.	340	347	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	network	network

Recent progress in research on drug-induced liver injury (DILI) has been determined by key developments in two areas. First, new technologies allow the identification of genetic risk factors with improved sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency. Second, new mechanistic concepts of DILI emphasize the importance of unspecific "downstream" events following drug-specific initial "upstream" hepatocyte injury and of complex interactions between environmental and genetic risk factors. The integration of genetic and mechanistic concepts is essential for current research approaches, and genetic studies of DILI now focus on targets that affect the function and transcriptional regulation of genes relating not only to drug metabolism but also to human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), cytokines, oxidative stress, and hepatobiliary transporters. Risk factors affecting unspecific downstream mechanisms may be identified using pooled DILI cases caused by various drugs. The power to detect variants that confer a low risk can be increased by recruitment of strictly selected cases through large networks, whereas controls may also be obtained from genotyped reference populations. The first genomewide studies of DILI identified HLA variants as risk factors for hepatotoxicity associated with flucloxacillin and ximelagatran, and their design has defined a new standard for pharmacogenetic studies. From a clinical and regulatory point of view, there is a need for genetic tests that identify patients at increased hepatotoxic risk. However, DILI is a rare complex disease, and pharmacogenetic studies have so far not been able to identify interactions of several risk factors defining a high population-attributable risk and clinically relevant absolute risk for DILI.	44	49	ORGAN	liver	liver
During developmental age, differences in pharmacodynamic reactions to several drugs may reflect polymorphisms of genes encoding drug-transporting proteins, receptors, drug targets, and gene products, whose disturbed activity sometimes plays an important role in certain diseases. Administration of drugs with a narrow therapeutic index may quite easily be associated with changes in pharmacokinetics and development of adverse drug reactions, which occasionally may cause fatalities. In such cases, polypragmasy and resulting drug interactions may enhance effects of changes in drug-metabolizing enzymes' activities. Phenotyping and genotyping of patients slowly are finding their place in some therapeutic regimens used in clinical gastroenterology and hepatology. At present, some assays to measure, for example, thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity are already commercially available. Polymorphisms of CYP450 enzymes, interleukins, and altered gene expression play an important role in some patients' various gastrointestinal tract and liver diseases. Herbal drugs also affect proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide balance in the body. Therapeutic use of recombined proteins, such as infliximab, natalizumab, onercept, humanized antibody to integrin α-4 β-7, or IFN-β in some large-bowel diseases increased therapeutic efficacy. IFN-α used in the patients with chronic hepatitis C improved cellular immunity in these subjects and exerted antiviral activity. Practical application of progress in pharmacogenetics, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and use of bioproducts in novel therapeutic regimens has opened therapeutic frontiers and increased clinical safety.	1042	1047	ORGAN	liver	liver

Hypertension is a leading age-related disease in our society and if left untreated, leads to fatal cardiovascular complications. The prevalence of hypertension has increased and becomes a significant global health economic burden, particularly in lower-income societies. Many loci associated with blood pressure and hypertension have been reported by genome-wide association studies that provided potential targets for pharmacotherapy. Pharmacogenetic research had shown interindividual variations in drug efficacy, safety, and tolerability. This could be due to genetic polymorphisms in the pharmacokinetics (genes involved in a transporter, plasma protein binding, and metabolism) or pharmacodynamic pathway (receptors, ion channels, enzymes). Pharmacogenetics promises great hope toward targeted therapy, but challenges remain in implementing pharmacogenetic aided antihypertensive therapy in clinical practice. Using various databases, we analyzed the underlying mechanisms between the candidate gene polymorphisms and antihypertensive drug interactions and the challenges of implementing precision medicine. We review the emergence of pharmacogenetics and its relevance to clinical pharmacological practice.	99	113	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular	cardiovascular

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and oral fluoropyrimidines, such as capecitabine, are widely used in the treatment of cancer, especially gastrointestinal tumors and breast cancer, but their administration can produce serious and even lethal toxicity. This toxicity is often related to the partial or complete deficiency of the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme, which causes a reduction in clearance and a longer half-life of 5-FU. It is advisable to determine if a DPD deficiency exists before administering these drugs by genotyping DPYD gene polymorphisms. The objective of this consensus of experts, in which representatives from the Spanish Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Society and the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology participated, is to establish clear recommendations for the implementation of genotype and/or phenotype testing for DPD deficiency in patients who are candidates to receive fluoropyrimidines. The genotyping of DPYD previous to treatment classifies individuals as normal, intermediate, or poor metabolizers. Normal metabolizers do not require changes in the initial dose, intermediate metabolizers should start treatment with fluoropyrimidines at doses reduced to 50%, and poor metabolizers are contraindicated for fluoropyrimidines.	26	48	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral fluoropyrimidines	oral fluoropyrimidines
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are some of the most widely prescribed medications worldwide and have been shown to be effective at lowering cholesterol in numerous long-term prospective trials, yet there are significant limitations to their use. First, patients receiving statin therapy have relatively low levels of medication adherence compared with other drug classes. Next, numerous statin formulations are available, each with its own unique safety and efficacy profile, and it may be unclear to prescribers which treatment is optimal for their patients. Finally, statins have class-wide side effects of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis that have resulted in a product recall and dosage limitations. Recent evidence suggests that two genomic markers, KIF6 and SLCO1B1, may inform the therapy choice of patients initiating statins. Given the prevalence of statin usage, their potential health advantages and their overall cost to the healthcare system, there could be significant clinical benefit from creating personalized treatment regimens. Ultimately, if this approach is effective it may encourage higher adoption of generic statins when appropriate, promote adherence, lower rates of myopathy, and overall achieve higher value cardiovascular care. This paper will review the evidence for personalized prescribing of statins via KIF6 and SLCO1B1 and consider some of the implications for testing these markers as part of routine clinical care.	1258	1272	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular	cardiovascular
Recent candidate gene studies using a human liver bank and in vivo validation in healthy volunteers identified polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 gene (CYP3A4*22), Ah-receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) genes that are associated with the CYP3A4 phenotype. We hypothesized that the variants identified in these genes may be associated with altered clopidogrel response, since generation of clopidogrel active metabolite is, partially mediated by CYP3A activity. Blood samples from 211 subjects, of mixed racial background, with established coronary artery disease, who had received clopidogrel, were analyzed. Platelet aggregation was determined using light transmittance aggregometry (LTA). Genotyping for CYP2C19*2, CYP3A4*22, PPAR-α (rs4253728, rs4823613), and ARNT (rs2134688) variant alleles was performed using Taqman® assays. CYP2C19*2 genotype was associated with increased on-treatment platelet aggregation (adenosine diphosphate 20 μM; P=0.025). No significant difference in on-treatment platelet aggregation, as measured by LTA during therapy with clopidogrel, was demonstrated among the different genotypes of CYP3A4*22, PPAR-α, and ARNT. These findings suggest that clopidogrel platelet inhibition is not influenced by the genetic variants that have previously been associated with reduced CYP3A4 activity.	607	622	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary artery	coronary artery
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used for acid suppression in the treatment and prevention of many conditions, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastric and duodenal ulcers, erosive esophagitis, Helicobacter pylori infection, and pathological hypersecretory conditions. Most PPIs are metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) into inactive metabolites, and CYP2C19 genotype has been linked to PPI exposure, efficacy, and adverse effects. We summarize the evidence from the literature and provide therapeutic recommendations for PPI prescribing based on CYP2C19 genotype (updates at www.cpicpgx.org). The potential benefits of using CYP2C19 genotype data to guide PPI therapy include (i) identifying patients with genotypes predictive of lower plasma exposure and prescribing them a higher dose that will increase the likelihood of efficacy, and (ii) identifying patients on chronic therapy with genotypes predictive of higher plasma exposure and prescribing them a decreased dose to minimize the risk of toxicity that is associated with long-term PPI use, particularly at higher plasma concentrations.	129	152	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	gastroesophageal reflux	gastroesophageal reflux

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that can lead to severe joint damage and is often associated with a high morbidity and disability. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the mainstay of treatment in RA. DMARDs not only relieve the clinical signs and symptoms of RA but also inhibit the radiographic progression of disease and reduce the effects of chronic systemic inflammation. Since the introduction of biologic DMARDs in the late 1990s, the therapeutic range of options for the management of RA has significantly expanded. However, patients' response to these agents is not uniform with considerable variability in both efficacy and toxicity. There are no reliable means of predicting an individual patient's response to a given DMARD prior to initiation of therapy. In this chapter, the current published literature on the pharmacogenetics of traditional DMARDS and the newer biologic DMARDs in RA is highlighted. Pharmacogenetics may help individualize drug therapy in patients with RA by providing reliable biomarkers to predict medication toxicity and efficacy.	94	99	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint	joint
Rheumatoid arthritis is a crippling autoimmune disease affecting more than 18 million people worldwide and thus becoming one of the important contributors to the global health burden. The majority of the affected are females, especially those above the age of 50, but males and younger adults are equally vulnerable. It is a constellation of genetic and environmental factors that interplay to manifest the joint deformities and disabilities that are the hallmarks of this disease. Painkillers are used alongside disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs to minimize the patient's agony and also to halt the progression of the disease. Worldwide, methotrexate is recommended as the first-line drug, but unexpected resistance is encountered in a significant number of patients. This review summarizes the pathophysiology, clinical findings, and therapeutic strategies for rheumatoid with a focus on research studies performed to establish a genetic basis for response fluctuations of methotrexate across different population groups.	407	412	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint	joint
One of the major goals of pharmacogenetics is to elucidate mechanisms and identify patients at increased risk of adverse events (AEs). To date, however, there have been only a few successful examples of this type of approach. In this paper, we describe a retrospective case-control pharmacogenetic study of an AE of unknown mechanism, characterized by elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) during long-term treatment with the oral direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran. The study was based on 74 cases and 130 treated controls and included both a genome-wide tag single nucleotide polymorphism and large-scale candidate gene analysis. A strong genetic association between elevated ALAT and the MHC alleles DRB1(*)07 and DQA1(*)02 was discovered and replicated, suggesting a possible immune pathogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, immunological studies suggest that ximelagatran may have the ability to act as a contact sensitizer, and hence be able to stimulate an adaptive immune response.	371	401	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum alanine aminotransferase	serum alanine aminotransferase

Despite the over 20 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) now licensed for epilepsy treatment, seizures can be effectively controlled in about ∼70% of patients. Thus, epilepsy treatment is still challenging in about one third of patients and this may lead to a severe medically, physically, and socially disabling condition. However, there is clear evidence of heterogeneity of response to existing AEDs and a significant unmet need for effective intervention. A number of studies have shown that polymorphisms may influence the poor or inadequate therapeutic response as well as the occurrence of adverse effects. In addition, the new frontier of genomic technologies, including chromosome microarrays and next-generation sequencing, improved our understanding of the genetic architecture of epilepsies. Recent findings in some genetic epilepsy syndromes provide insights into mechanisms of epileptogenesis, unrevealing the role of a number of genes with different functions, such as ion channels, proteins associated to the vesical synaptic cycle or involved in energy metabolism. The rapid progress of high-throughput genomic sequencing and corresponding analysis tools in molecular diagnosis are revolutionizing the practice and it is a fact that for some monogenic epilepsies the molecular confirmation may influence the choice of the treatment. Moreover, the novel genetic methods, that are able to analyze all known genes at a reasonable price, are of paramount importance to discover novel therapeutic avenues and individualized (or precision) medicine.	1015	1031	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	vesical synaptic	vesical synaptic
Dichloroacetate (DCA) has several therapeutic applications based on its pharmacological property of inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. DCA has been used to treat inherited mitochondrial disorders that result in lactic acidosis, as well as pulmonary hypertension and several different solid tumors, the latter through its ability to reverse the Warburg effect in cancer cells and restore aerobic glycolysis. The main clinically limiting toxicity is reversible peripheral neuropathy. Although administration of high doses to rodents can result in liver cancer, there is no evidence that DCA is a human carcinogen. In all studied species, including humans, DCA has the interesting property of inhibiting its own metabolism upon repeat dosing, resulting in alteration of its pharmacokinetics. The first step in DCA metabolism is conversion to glyoxylate catalyzed by glutathione transferase zeta 1 (GSTZ1), for which DCA is a mechanism-based inactivator. The rate of GSTZ1 inactivation by DCA is influenced by age, GSTZ1 haplotype and cellular concentrations of chloride. The effect of DCA on its own metabolism complicates the selection of an effective dose with minimal side effects.	179	192	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	mitochondrial	mitochondrial

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. The cause of psoriasis is unknown, although genetics may play a key role in its development. Treatment of the disease varies with severity. Topical drugs, such as corticosteroids, coal tar, retinoids and vitamin D analogs, are commonly used to treat mild psoriasis. Phototherapy and systemic drugs, such as calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate, acitretin and biological drugs, are usually used to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Not all patients respond well to treatment, and some can develop severe adverse effects. Interindividual differences in several genes may explain this variation in response to treatment. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics can facilitate more personalized medicine and prevent the adverse effects associated with treatment.	36	40	ORGAN	skin	skin

The Chinese Genomic Variation Database (CGVD; https://bigd.big.ac.cn/cgvd/) is such a database that has combined 48.30 million (M) SNVs and 5.77 M small indels, identified from 991 Chinese individuals of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Precision Medicine Initiative Project (CASPMI) and 301 Chinese individuals of the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP). The CASPMI project includes whole-genome sequencing data (WGS, 25-30×) from ∼1000 healthy individuals of the CASPMI cohort. To facilitate the usage of such variations for pharmacogenomics studies, star-allele frequencies of the drug-related genes in the CASPMI and 1KGP populations are calculated and provided in CGVD. As one of the important database resources in BIG Data Center, CGVD will continue to collect more genomic variations and to curate structural and functional annotations to support population-based healthcare projects and studies in China and worldwide.	935	939	ORGAN	CGVD	CGVD
The aim of this analysis was to create a pharmacometric model of efavirenz developmental pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics in HIV-infected children. The data consisted of 3,172 plasma concentrations from 96 HIV-1-infected children who participated in the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group 382 (PACTG382) study. Analyses were performed using NONMEM, and the impacts of body weight, age, race, sex, formulation, liver function, and cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6)-G516T and multidrug-resistance transporter gene (MDR1)-C3435T polymorphisms were assessed. A one-compartment model using weight-based allometry on oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution adequately described the data. A sigmoid maximum-effect (Emax) maturation model demonstrated an increase in oral clearance with age to reach 90% of its mature level by the age of 9 months. The liquid formulation bioavailability relative to the capsule was found to increase with age to reach 90% of its mature value by the age of 8 years. The CYP2B6-G516T polymorphism decreased oral clearance, while the MDR1-C3435T polymorphism demonstrated no effect.	375	379	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	body	body

The often-debilitating ulcers that develop on the feet of patients with diabetes (i.e., "diabetic foot ulcers") are among the most common types of chronic wounds. Their persistent failure to heal despite treatment is a significant cause of morbidity in a patient population often challenged by concomitant health conditions and quality-of-life issues. When a commercially manufactured therapy does not adequately heal such lesions, a compounded formulation may offer an effective alternative. In those customized medications, several drugs with different mechanisms of action can be combined in strengths or titrations compatible with each patient's pharmacogenomics profile, and the formulation of a compound can be easily altered as healing progresses and/or the patient's medical needs change. In this first in a series of 2 articles on compounding for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, the types, pathophysiologic causes, risk factors, and treatment of those lesions are discussed and formulations that promote their healing are provided. In part 2 of the series, differences in the healing of acute and chronic wounds are examined, the results of pharmacotherapy in treating diabetic foot ulcers are reviewed, the effectiveness of several drugs that promote chronic-wound healing is assessed, and additional formulations effective in treating nonhealing wounds are presented.	23	29	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	ulcers	ulcers

In clinical practice, there is a need for a more individualized selection of antidepressants and adequate dosage. The investigation of pharmacokinetically relevant genes is a promising approach to assist this selection. In the past 2 years, two commercially available tests have been subject of advertisement, a test from Stada, which analyses variants of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 and a test from HMNC Brain Health, which analyses variants of the ABCB1 gene. The costs for both kits are not covered by the statutory health insurance and it is therefore proposed that the patients are invoiced directly in the form of individual healthcare payment. The companies claim that by applying the tests antidepressant treatment failure can be avoided and that patients will respond faster to the antidepressant used. These claims are not based on appropriate clinical trials, which are either lacking or reveal conflicting results. Hence, the routine use of these tests is not recommended. In accordance with the German S3 Guideline for unipolar depression, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of serum levels should be carried out in cases of non-response to an antidepressant with adequate dosage and duration. As a rule the costs for TDM are covered by the statutory health insurance. Cytochrome P450 genotyping is only indicated when the serum level is not within the expected range and other reasons to explain this discrepancy are excluded. Many laboratories provide these analyses and in individual cases the costs are reimbursed by the statutory health insurance. Further research should be carried out to investigate the importance of the ABCB1 gene for the treatment with antidepressants.	1112	1117	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum	serum

Corticosteroids (CS) such as methylprednisolone (MPL) affect almost all liver functions through multiple mechanisms of action, and long-term use results in dysregulation causing diverse side effects. The complexity of involved molecular mechanisms necessitates a systems approach. Integration of information from the transcriptomic and proteomic responses has potential to provide deeper insights into CS actions. The present report describes the tandem analysis of rich time-series transcriptomic and proteomic data in rat liver after a single dose of MPL. Hierarchical clustering of the common genes represented in both mRNA and protein datasets displayed two dominant patterns. One of these patterns exhibited complementary mRNA and protein expression profiles indicating that MPL affected the regulation of these genes at the transcriptional level. Some of the classic pharmacodynamic markers for CS actions, including tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), were among this group, together with genes encoding urea cycle enzymes and ribosomal proteins. The other pattern was rather unexpected. For this group of genes, MPL had distinctly observable effects at the protein expression level, although a change in the reverse direction occurred at the transcriptional level. These genes were functionally associated with metabolic processes that might be essential to elucidate side effects of MPL on liver, most importantly including modulation of oxidative stress, fatty acid oxidation, and bile acid biosynthesis. Furthermore, profiling of gene and protein expression data was also done independently of one another by a two-way sequential approach. Prominent temporal shifts in expression and relevant cellular functions were described together with the assessment of changes in the complementary side.	72	77	ORGAN	liver	liver

Both itraconazole (ITCZ) and voriconazole (VCZ) are potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, and their effects have been reported to be equal. However, ITCZ is metabolized by CYP3A, whereas VCZ is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and only partially by CYP3A. We experienced the case of a patient who showed a 5-fold increase in trough levels of tacrolimus (FK) level after switching from ITCZ to VCZ. Our objective is to discuss the mechanism of the increase drug-drug interaction in terms of serum concentration of the azole drugs and patient pharmacogenomics.	507	512	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum	serum
The treatment of breast cancer with selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen and with aromatase inhibitors represents a major advance in cancer chemotherapy. However, there are large variations among patients in both the therapeutic efficacy and side effects of these drugs. Pharmacogenomics is the study of the role of inheritance in this variation and genetic variation in tamoxifen response represents one of the most striking examples of the potential clinical importance of pharmacogenomics. Tamoxifen requires "metabolic activation" catalyzed by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to form hydroxylated metabolites-4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen (N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen)-both of which are much more potent than is the parent drug. However, CYP2D6 is genetically polymorphic. Approximately 5-8% of Caucasian subjects are CYP2D6 "poor metabolizers" on a genetic basis and, as a result, are relatively unable to catalyze tamoxifen hydroxylation. These same subjects appear to have poorer outcomes when treated with tamoxifen than do CYP2D6 "extensive metabolizers: These data led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to hold public hearings in 2006 on the inclusion of this pharmacogenomic information in tamoxifen labeling. However, a series of important questions still remains to be addressed with regard to tamoxifen pharmacogenomics. There have also been preliminary attempts to study the pharmacogenomics ofaromatase inhibitors, including the application of a genotype-to-phenotype research strategy designed to explore the nature and extent of common DNA sequence variation in the CYP19 gene that encodes aromatase. Those results-together with our current level of understanding of tamoxifen pharmacogenomics-will be reviewed in this chapter and both will be placed within the context of the overall development of pharmacogenomics.	1585	1588	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA
The individual patient responses to chronic heart failure (HF) pharmacotherapies are highly variable. This variability cannot be entirely explained by clinical characteristics, and genetic variation may play a role. Therefore, this review will summarize the background pharmacogenetic literature for major HF pharmacotherapy classes (ie, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and loop diuretics), evaluate recent advances in the HF pharmacogenetic literature in the context of previous findings, and discuss the challenges and conclusions for HF pharmacogenetic data and its clinical application.	44	49	ORGAN	heart	heart
TNF-α inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy both as monotherapy and in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the treatment of chronic inflammatory immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis (Ps) and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and may be administered off-label to treat disseminated granuloma annulare, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. There are several TNF-α inhibitors available for clinical use including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept. In this article, we discuss the efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of spondyloarthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Etanercept is effective in the treatment of PsA, AS, JIA and uveitis. Independent predictors of achieving a sustained clinical improvement or MDA in children with JIA include shorter disease duration, no concurrent oral corticosteroid use, history of chronic anterior uveitis and age <9 years. IBD incidence was lower in patients receiving etanercept plus MTX. Intra-articular administration of etanercept seems to favor a prompt target joint improvement without serious adverse events. Etanercept improve endothelial function reducing the risk of acute cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events. The most commonly reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, epidermal and dermal conditions, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, headache and fatigue.	232	237	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Crohn	Crohn

The scaling up of data in clinical pharmacology and the merger of systems biology and pharmacology has led to the emergence of a new discipline of Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP). This new research direction might significantly advance the discovery, development, and clinical use of therapeutic drugs. Research communities from computational biology, systems biology, and biological engineering--working collaboratively with pharmacologists, geneticists, biochemists, and analytical chemists--are creating and modeling large data on drug effects that is transforming our understanding of how these drugs work at a network level. In this review, we highlight developments in a new and rapidly growing field--pharmacometabolomics--in which large biochemical data-capturing effects of genome, gut microbiome, and environment exposures is revealing information about metabotypes and treatment outcomes, and creating metabolic signatures as new potential biomarkers. Pharmacometabolomics informs and complements pharmacogenomics and together they provide building blocks for QSP.	803	806	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	gut	gut
Human leukocyte antigen (<i>HLA</i>) encoded by the <i>HLA</i> gene is an important modulator for immune responses and drug hypersensitivity reactions as well. Genetic polymorphisms of <i>HLA</i> vary widely at population level and are responsible for developing severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), maculopapular exanthema (MPE). The associations of different <i>HLA</i> alleles with the risk of drug induced SJS/TEN, DRESS and MPE are strongly supportive for clinical considerations. Prescribing guidelines generated by different national and international working groups for translation of <i>HLA</i> pharmacogenetics into clinical practice are underway and functional in many countries, including Thailand. Cutting edge genomic technologies may accelerate wider adoption of <i>HLA</i> screening in routine clinical settings. There are great opportunities and several challenges as well for effective implementation of <i>HLA</i> genotyping globally in routine clinical practice for the prevention of drug induced SCARs substantially, enforcing precision medicine initiatives.	357	366	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	epidermal	epidermal

Drug-resistant epilepsy, is a condition defined by the International League Against Epilepsy as persistent seizures despite having used at least two appropriate and adequate antiepileptic drug treatments. Approximately 20-30% of patients with epilepsy are going to be resistant to antiepileptic drugs, with different patterns of clinical presentation, which are related to the biological basis of this disease (de novo resistance, relapsing-remitting and progressive). Drug resistant epilepsy, impacts negatively the quality of life and significantly increases the risk of premature death. From the neurobiological point of view, this medical condition is the result of the interaction of multiple variables related to the underlying disease, drug interactions and proper genetic aspects of each patient. Thanks to advances in pharmacogenetics and molecular biology research, currently some hypotheses may explain the cause of this condition and promote the study of new therapeutic options. Currently, overexpression of membrane transporters such as P-glycoprotein, appears to be one of the most important mechanisms in the development of drug resistant epilepsy. The objective of this review is to deepen the general aspects of this clinical condition, addressing the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnosis and the pathophysiological bases.	1021	1029	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	membrane	membrane

Most neurodegenerative diseases are currently incurable, with large social and economic impacts. Recently, there has been renewed interest in investigating natural products in the modern drug discovery paradigm as novel, bioactive small molecules. Moreover, the discovery of potential therapies for neurological disorders is challenging and involves developing optimized animal models for drug screening. In contemporary biomedicine, the growing need to develop experimental models to obtain a detailed understanding of malady conditions and to portray pioneering treatments has resulted in the application of zebrafish to close the gap between in vitro and in vivo assays. Zebrafish in pharmacogenetics and neuropharmacology are rapidly becoming a widely used organism. Brain function, dysfunction, genetic, and pharmacological modulation considerations are enhanced by both larval and adult zebrafish. Bioassay-guided identification of natural products using zebrafish presents as an attractive strategy for generating new lead compounds. Here, we see evidence that the zebrafish's central nervous system is suitable for modeling human neurological disease and we review and evaluate natural product research using zebrafish as a vertebrate model platform to systematically identify bioactive natural products. Finally, we review recently developed zebrafish models of neurological disorders that have the potential to be applied in this field of research.	1084	1106	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system	central nervous system
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of multiple peripheral joints, which leads to serious destruction of cartilage and bone, progressive deformity and severe disability. Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the first-line drugs commonly used in RA therapy owing to its excellent long-term efficacy and cheapness. However, the efficacy and toxicity of MTX treatment have significant interpatient variability. Genetic factors contribute to this variability. In this review, we have summarized and updated the progress of RA response to MTX treatment since 2009 by focusing on the fields of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics. Identification of genetic factors involved in MTX treatment response will increase the understanding of RA pathology and the development of new personalized treatments.	118	135	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	peripheral joints	peripheral joints

Studies in hypertension (HTN) pharmacogenomics seek to identify genetic sources of variable antihypertensive drug response. Genetic association studies have detected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that link to drug responses; however, to understand mechanisms underlying how genetic traits alter drug responses, a biological interface is needed. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potential source for studying otherwise inaccessible tissues that may be important to antihypertensive drug response. The present study established multiple iPSC lines from an HTN pharmacogenomics cohort. We demonstrated that established HTN iPSCs can robustly and reproducibly differentiate into functional vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), a cell type most relevant to vasculature tone control. Moreover, a sensitive traction force microscopy assay demonstrated that iPSC-derived VSMCs show a quantitative contractile response on physiological stimulus of endothelin-1. Furthermore, the inflammatory chemokine tumor necrosis factor α induced a typical VSMC response in iPSC-derived VSMCs. These studies pave the way for a large research initiative to decode biological significance of identified SNPs in hypertension pharmacogenomics.	472	479	TISSUE	tissues	tissues

Five to ten percent of all asthmatics, many dozens of millions of patients all over the world, do not respond to maximal medical therapy, including systemic steroids, and the toll of treating them constitutes about eighty percent of the total cost of managing all asthmatics. Other asthmatics who do respond to medical therapy either are not compliant with their medications or suffer from disabling adverse effects. The future therapy of asthma will concentrate on finding medical solutions to these sub-groups of patients but the entire asthmatic population will enjoy its achievements. The future trends in asthma therapy include immunomodulation, managing receptors and inflammatory mediators that are crucial in asthma pathogenesis, formulation of custom-made medications using individual pharmacogenetics, elaborated specific immunotherapy of atopic rhinitis, development of "smart inhalers" and sophisticated techniques in aerosol transportation to the airways, and bronchial thermoplasty which has only recently been approved. The daily clinical implications of these trends will probably unfold in the next five to fifteen years.	960	967	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	airways	airways
Polymorphisms in the drug transporter gene ABCB1 account for differences in the clinically efficacy of the most drugs, most likely by influencing their access to the brain. The majority proportion of depressed patients, given a regular dose, do not respond properly or experience severe side effects. One explanation may be the polymorphisms in the drug transporter gene ABCB1, which account for differences in the clinical efficacy of antidepressants, neuroleptics or mood stabilizers most likely by influencing their access to the brain. If patients are treated with a substrate of P-gp, functionally relevant genetic variants in the ABCB1 transporter could influence intracerebral drug concentrations and, thereby, clinical response.

Asthma is a common, chronic disease of the airways that is treated with a combination of different therapies. The combination of LABA and ICS therapy results in a synergistic interaction that is efficacious in improving asthma symptom control; however, genetic variation has the potential to alter therapeutic efficacy. Both agents mediate complex molecular pathways consisting of gene variation that has been investigated with the analysis of candidate genes in the β2-adrenergic receptor and glucocorticoid pathway. These pharmacogenetic studies have been limited to retrospective analyses of clinical trial cohorts and a small number of prospective, genotype-stratified trials. More recently, genome-wide association studies in combination with replication in additional cohorts and in vitro cell-based models have been used to identify novel pathway-related pharmacogenetic variations. This review of the pharmacogenetics of the β2-adrenergic receptor and glucocorticoid pathways highlights the genotypic effects of variation in multiple genes from interacting pathways which may contribute to differential responses to inhaled beta agonists and glucocorticoids. As our understanding of these genetic mechanisms improves, panels of biomarkers may be developed to determine which combination therapies are the most effective with the least risk to an individual asthma patient. Before we can usher in an era of personalized medicine for asthma, it is first important to improve our ability to analyze large volumes of genetic data in large clinical trial cohorts using a combination of study designs, analytical methods, and in vitro functional studies.	43	50	ORGAN	airways	airways
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disorder that mainly affects the joints. When left untreated, the disease can result in irreversible joint damage with high morbidity and mortality. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are the cornerstones of treatment in RA. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs not only ameliorate the clinical signs and symptoms of disease, but also prevent the radiographic progression of joint damage. Methotrexate is one such disease-modifying antirheumatic drug that has been used in the treatment of RA for over two decades with excellent long-term efficacy and safety. However, there is significant variability in patients' response to methotrexate, both in terms of efficacy and toxicity. At the present time, there are no reliable means of predicting, a priori, an individual patient's response to methotrexate. In this review, recent published literature on the pharmacogenetics of methotrexate in RA is highlighted. Pharmacogenetics may be a powerful tool for optimizing methotrexate therapy in patients with RA.	86	92	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	joints	joints

However, there is significant variability in patients' response to methotrexate, both in terms of efficacy and toxicity. At the present time, there are no reliable means of predicting, a priori, an individual patient's response to methotrexate. In this review, recent published literature on the pharmacogenetics of methotrexate in RA is highlighted. Pharmacogenetics may be a powerful tool for optimizing methotrexate therapy in patients with RA.	154	159	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint	joint
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disorder that mainly affects the joints. When left untreated, the disease can result in irreversible joint damage with high morbidity and mortality. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are the cornerstones of treatment in RA.

Bupropion is hydroxylated to its primary active metabolite hydroxybupropion by cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2B6. In vitro data suggest the existence of alternative hydroxylation pathways mediated by the highly polymorphic enzyme CYP2C19. However, the impact of its genetic variants on bupropion metabolism in vivo is still under investigation. We report the case of a 28-year-old male Caucasian outpatient suffering from major depressive disorder who did not respond to a treatment with bupropion. Therapeutic drug monitoring revealed very low serum concentrations of both bupropion and hydroxybupropion. Genotyping identified a heterozygous status for the gain-of-function allele with the genotype CYP2C19*1/*17 predicting enhanced enzymatic activity. The present case shows a reduced bupropion efficacy, which may be explained by a reduced active moiety of bupropion and its active metabolite hydroxybupropion, due to alternative hydroxylation pathways mediated by CYP2C19 in an individual with CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer status. The case report thus illustrates the clinical relevance of therapeutic drug monitoring in combination with pharmacogenetics diagnostics for a personalized treatment approach.	541	546	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	serum	serum
In contrast to the studies that have explored association of genetic variants with other complex traits, those investigating hepatotoxicity have identified risk alleles with substantially higher risk ratios for the susceptibility to drug-induced liver injury (DILI). In addition, a relatively small number of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have overlapping associations with a variety of adverse reactions including DILI, cutaneous hypersensitivity and drug-induced pancreatitis. However, if used as a test prior to prescription to prevent potential adverse reaction, genotyping would have a very high negative predictive value, yet a low positive predictive value based on the low incidence of DILI. One potential consideration is to treat all relevant HLA genotypes as one panel covering different forms of adverse drug reactions, thereby improving the positive predictive value of the panel and widen its application. The majority of HLA alleles associated with DILI have a very high negative predictive value; therefore, they can be used to rule out hepatotoxicity caused by particular drugs. A high negative predictive value of a genetic test can be used to identify the correct agent underlying DILI when the patient had been exposed to two concomitant medications with a potential to cause DILI. Inclusion of genetic tests in the causality assessment of an event, where DILI is suspected, may improve consistency and precision of causality assessment tools. A recent clinical trial used N-acetyltransferase 2 genotyping to determine the appropriate dose of isoniazid in an anti-tuberculosis therapeutic regimen and demonstrated that pharmacogenetic-based clinical algorithms have the potential to improve efficacy of a drug and to reduce DILI.	246	251	ORGAN	liver	liver
Alirocumab, an antibody that blocks PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), was associated with reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death in the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial (Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab). In this study, higher baseline levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) predicted greater benefit from alirocumab treatment. Recent studies indicate high polygenic risk scores (PRS) for coronary artery disease (CAD) identify individuals at higher risk who derive increased benefit from statins. We performed post hoc analyses to determine whether high PRS for CAD identifies higher-risk individuals, independent of baseline LDL-C and other known risk factors, who might derive greater benefit from alirocumab treatment.	250	264	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	Acute Coronary	Acute Coronary

The impact of drug transporters on drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics has been increasingly recognized in recent years. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the ABCB1 (formerly MDR1) gene, is among the most well-characterized drug transporters, particularly in veterinary medicine. P-gp is expressed by a variety of normal tissues, including the intestines, brain capillary endothelial cells, renal tubular cells, and biliary canalicular cells, where it functions to actively extrude substrate drugs. In this capacity, P-gp limits oral absorption and central nervous system entry of many substrate drugs and enhances their excretion from the body. Many drugs used in veterinary medicine are substrates for P-gp, including many chemotherapeutic agents and macrocyclic lactones (avermectins and milbemycin). A 4-base pair deletion mutation in the ABCB1 gene occurs in many herding breed dogs, including collies, Australian shepherds, and Shetland sheepdogs. The mutation (ABCB1-1Delta) renders affected animals extremely susceptible to toxicosis induced by substrate drugs, such as the macrocyclic lactones at doses well below those tolerated by dogs with the wild-type ABCB1 gene. However, at the manufacturer's recommended dose, all FDA-approved heartworm preventive products marketed in the United States are safe, even for dogs with the ABCB1 mutant/mutant genotype.	332	339	TISSUE	tissues	tissues

<b>Purpose:</b> <i>HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>15:02</i> is strongly associated with life-threatening severe skin hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with carbamazepine (CBZ) and structurally related medications. FDA-approved labeling recommends <i>HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>15:02</i> screening before CBZ therapy in patients of Asian ancestry. In this study, we aimed to (a) identify a direct method for screening <i>HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>15:02</i>, and (b) evaluate prevalence in a large cohort of United States patients. <b>Methods:</b> Candidate genetic markers were identified by mining public data. Association was tested in 28,897 individuals by comparing SNP results with high-resolution HLA typing. Retrospective analysis of de-identified SNP and ethnicity data from 130,460 individuals was performed to evaluate the ethnic distribution of <i>HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>15:02</i> in the United States. <b>Results:</b> 28,897 United States individuals showed 100% concordance between <i>HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>15:02</i> and the minor allele of rs144012689 (100% sensitivity/99.97% specificity). Retrospective analysis of 160 positive individuals (66 with physician-reported ethnicity) notably included 28 Asians (42%), 15 African Americans (22%), 11 Caucasians (17%), 2 Hispanics (3%), and 10 "Other" (15%). <b>Conclusion:</b> Screening United States patients for <i>HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>15:02</i> without ethnicity-based preselection identifies more than twice the number of carriers at risk of CBZ-related adverse events than screening patients of Asian ancestry alone. Risk assessment based on ethnicity assumptions may not identify a large portion of at-risk patients in the ethnically diverse United States population.	98	102	ORGAN	skin	skin
The human N-acetyltransferase 2 enzyme, encoded by the <i>NAT2</i> gene, plays an important role in the metabolism of isoniazid, the main drug used to treat tuberculosis. The interindividual variation in the response of patients to drug treatment for tuberculosis may be responsible for the occurrence of unfavorable outcomes. The presence of polymorphisms in genes associated with the metabolism and transport of drugs, receptors, and therapeutic targets has been identified as a major determinant of this variability. The objective of this study was to identify the genetic profile of <i>NAT2</i> in the study population. Using the obtained genomic DNA followed by PCR amplification and sequencing, the frequency of nine SNPs as well as alleles associated with slow (47.9%), intermediate (38.7%), and fast acetylation phenotypes (11.3%), in addition to those whose phenotype has not yet been characterized (2.1%), was estimated. The <i>NAT2*5B</i> allele was identified more frequently (31.3%). The description of SNPs in pharmacogenes and the establishment of their relationship with the pharmacokinetics of an individual offer an individualized approach that allows us to reduce the unfavorable outcomes of a therapy, ensure better adherence to treatment, prevent the emergence of MDR strains, reduce the cost of treatment, and improve the quality of patients' lives.	651	654	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA

We investigated whether a predefined combination of the Arg389Gly polymorphism in the adrenergic β(1) -receptor gene (ADRB1) and the Gln27Glu polymorphism in the adrenergic β(2) -receptor gene (ADRB2) could predict survival in carvedilol- and metoprolol-treated chronic heart failure (HF) patients.	376	381	ORGAN	heart	heart
The approach to epilepsy care has transformed in the last 30 years, with more and better anti-epileptic medications, improved cerebral imaging and increased surgical options. Alongside this, developments in neuroscience and molecular genetics have furthered the understanding of epileptogenesis. Future developments in pharmacogenomics hold the promise of antiepileptic drugs matched to specific genotypes. Despite this rapid progress, one-third of epilepsy patients remain refractory to medication, with their seizures impacting upon day-to-day activity, social well-being, independence, economic output and quality of life. International genome collaborations, such as HapMap and the Welcome Trust Case-Control Consortium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping project have identified common genetic variations in diseases of major public health importance. Such genetic signposts should help to identify at-risk populations with a view to producing more effective pharmaceutical treatments. Neurological disorders, despite comprising one-fifth of UK acute medical hospital admissions, are surprisingly under-represented in these projects. Epilepsy is the commonest serious neurological disorder worldwide. Although physically, psychologically, socially and financially disabling, it rarely receives deserved attention from physicians, scientists and governmental bodies. As outlined in this article, research into epilepsy genetics presents unique challenges. These help to explain why the identification of its complex genetic traits has lagged well behind other disciplines, particularly the efforts made in neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical beginnings must underpin any genetic understanding in epilepsy. Success in identifying genetic traits in other disorders does not make the automatic case for genome-wide screening in epilepsy, but such is a desired goal. The essential clinical approach of accurately phenotyping, diagnosing and interpreting the dynamic nature of epilepsy remains fundamental to harvesting its potential translational outcomes.	126	134	ORGAN	cerebral	cerebral
Various diseases require the selection of preferable treatment out of available alternatives. Multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune inflammatory/neurodegenerative disease of the CNS, requires long-term medication with either specific disease-modifying therapy (DMT) - IFN-β or glatiramer acetate (GA) - which remain the only first-line DMTs in all countries. A significant share of MS patients are resistant to treatment with one or the other DMT; therefore, the earliest choice of preferable DMT is of particular importance. A number of conventional pharmacogenetic studies performed up to the present day have identified the treatment-sensitive genetic biomarkers that might be specific for the particular drug; however, the suitable biomarkers for selection of one or another first-line DMT are remained to be found. Comparative pharmacogenetic analysis may allow the identification of the discriminative genetic biomarkers, which may be more informative for an a priori DMT choice than those found in conventional pharmacogenetic studies. The search for discriminative markers of preferable first-line DMT, which differ in carriage between IFN-β responders and GA responders as well as between IFN-β nonresponders and GA nonresponders, has been performed in 253 IFN-β-treated MS patients and 285 GA-treated MS patients. A bioinformatics algorithm for identification of composite biomarkers (allelic sets) was applied on a unified set of immune-response genes, which are relevant for IFN-β and/or GA modes of action, and identical clinical criteria of treatment response. We found the range of discriminative markers, which include polymorphic variants of CCR5, IFNAR1, TGFB1, DRB1 or CTLA4 genes, in different combinations. Every allelic set includes the CCR5 genetic variant, which probably suggests its crucial role in the modulation of the DMT response. Special attention should be given to the (CCR5*d+ IFNAR1*G) discriminative combination, which clearly points towards IFN-β treatment choice for carriers of this combination. As a whole the comparative approach provides an option for the identification of prognostic composite biomarkers for a preferable medication among available alternatives.	179	182	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	CNS	CNS
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 6 (ALS6) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by heterozygous mutation in the Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) gene. ALS6 is a neurodegenerative disorder, which affects the upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in fatal paralysis. ALS6 is caused by the genetic mutation in the proline/tyrosine-nuclear localization signals of the Fused in sarcoma Protein (FUS). FUS gene also known as TLS (Translocated in liposarcoma), which encodes a protein called RNA-binding protein-Fus (FUS), has a molecular weight of 75 kDa. In this analysis, we applied computational approach to filter the most deleterious and neurodegenerative disease of ALS6-associated mutation on FUS protein. We found H517Q as most deleterious and disease associated using PolyPhen 2.0, I-Mutant 3.0, SIFT, SNPs&GO, PhD-SNP, Pmut, and Mutpred tools. Molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) approach was conducted to investigate conformational changes in the mutant protein structure with respect to its native conformation. MDS results showed the flexibility loss in mutant (H517Q) FUS protein. Due to mutation, FUS protein became more rigid in nature and might alter the structural and functional behavior of protein and play a major role in inducing ALS6. The results obtained from this investigation would help in the field of pharmacogenomics to develop a potent drug target against FUS-associated neurodegenerative diseases.	198	203	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	upper	upper

Pain is an unpleasant feeling usually resulting from tissue damage that can persist along weeks, months, or even years after the injury, turning into pathological chronic pain, the leading cause of disability. Currently, pharmacology interventions are usually the first-line therapy but there is a highly variable analgesic drug response. Pharmacogenetics (PGx) offers a means to identify genetic biomarkers that can predict individual analgesic response opening doors to precision medicine. PGx analyze the way in which the presence of variations in the DNA sequence (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) could be responsible for portions of the population reaching different levels of pain relief (phenotype) due to gene interference in the drug mechanism of action (pharmacodynamics) and/or its concentration at the place of action (pharmacokinetics). SNPs in the cytochrome P450 enzymes genes (CYP2D6) influence metabolism of codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and tricyclic antidepressants. Blood concentrations of some NSAIDs depend on CYP2C9 and/or CYP2C8 activity. Additional candidate genes encode for opioid receptors, transporters, and other molecules important for pharmacotherapy in pain management. However, PGx studies are often contradictory, slowing the uptake of this information. This is likely due, in large part, to a lack of robust evidence demonstrating clinical utility and to its polygenic response modulated by other exogenous or epigenetics factors. Novel therapies, including targeting of epigenetic changes and gene therapy-based approaches, broaden future options to improve understanding of pain and the treatment of people who suffer it.	53	59	TISSUE	tissue	tissue

Molecular genetics is the study, at the molecular level, of how genetic information is stored, inherited, and expressed and of how it influences the structure and function of cells in health and in disease. Although molecular approaches have been used for decades in the laboratory and are at the core of modern medical education, they are only now beginning to influence clinical practice. A variety of sophisticated techniques permit rapid and affordable DNA sequencing, gene expression profiling, gene cloning, gene manipulation, gene transfer, recombinant protein production, and other technologies of enormous biomedical importance. Success in genomics has spawned additional ambitious endeavors, including proteomics, pharmacogenomics, and bioinformatics. These techniques are providing new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic opportunities in all areas of medicine, including anesthesiology. With the use of molecular criteria and the diminishing cost of analytic technologies, anesthetic practice will become more individualized, and greater emphasis will be placed on the patient's genetic makeup. Both surgical and nonsurgical decisions will increasingly accommodate molecular data crucial to perioperative anesthetic management. In this article we have summarized three lectures on congenital malformations, pharmacogenetics, and proteomics presented at the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia.	457	460	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA
Hypertension is the strongest modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, affecting 80 million individuals in the US and responsible for ∼360,000 deaths, at total annual costs of $93.5 billion. Antihypertension therapies guided by single genotypes are clinically more effective and may avert more adverse events than the standard of care of layering anti-hypertensive drug therapies, thus potentially decreasing costs. This study aimed to determine the economic benefits of the implementation of multi-gene panel guided therapies for hypertension from the payer perspective within a 3-year time horizon.	57	71	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	cardiovascular	cardiovascular
CYP2C19 genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention is increasingly implemented in clinical practice. However, challenges such as selecting a testing platform, communicating test results, building clinical decision support processes, providing patient and provider education, and integrating methods to support the translation of emerging evidence to clinical practice are barriers to broad adoption. In this report, we compare and contrast implementation strategies of 12 early adopters, describing solutions to common problems and initial performance metrics for each program. Key differences between programs included the test result turnaround time and timing of therapy changes, which are both related to the CYP2C19 testing model and platform used. Sites reported the need for new informatics infrastructure, expert clinicians such as pharmacists to interpret results, physician champions, and ongoing education. Consensus lessons learned are presented to provide a path forward for those seeking to implement similar clinical pharmacogenomics programs within their institutions.	68	76	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary	coronary
Polygenic diseases are caused by the joint contribution of a number of independently acting or interacting polymorphic genes; the individual contribution of each gene may be small or even unnoticeable. The carriage of certain combinations of genes can determine the occurrence of clinically heterogeneous forms of the disease and treatment efficacy. This review describes the approaches used in a polygenic analysis of data in medical genomics, in particular, pharmacogenomics, aimed at identifying the cumulative effect of genes. This effect may result from the summation of gains of different genes or be caused by the epistatic interaction between the genes. Both cases are undoubtedly of great interest in investigating the nature of polygenic diseases. The means that allow one to discriminate between these two possibilities are discussed. The methods for searching for combinations of alleles of different genes associated with the polygenic phenotypic traits of the disease, as well as the methods for presenting and validating the results, are described and compared. An attempt is made to evaluate the applicability of the existing methods to an epistasis analysis. The results obtained by the authors using the APSampler software are described and summarized.	37	42	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	joint	joint

Astrocytes are ubiquitous in the brain and are widely held to be largely identical. However, this view has not been fully tested, and the possibility that astrocytes are neural circuit specialized remains largely unexplored. Here, we used multiple integrated approaches, including RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), mass spectrometry, electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, serial block-face-scanning electron microscopy, morphological reconstructions, pharmacogenetics, and diffusible dye, calcium, and glutamate imaging, to directly compare adult striatal and hippocampal astrocytes under identical conditions. We found significant differences in electrophysiological properties, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, morphology, and astrocyte-synapse proximity between striatal and hippocampal astrocytes. Unbiased evaluation of actively translated RNA and proteomic data confirmed significant astrocyte diversity between hippocampal and striatal circuits. We thus report core astrocyte properties, reveal evidence for specialized astrocytes within neural circuits, and provide new, integrated database resources and approaches to explore astrocyte diversity and function throughout the adult brain.

Here, we used multiple integrated approaches, including RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), mass spectrometry, electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, serial block-face-scanning electron microscopy, morphological reconstructions, pharmacogenetics, and diffusible dye, calcium, and glutamate imaging, to directly compare adult striatal and hippocampal astrocytes under identical conditions. We found significant differences in electrophysiological properties, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, morphology, and astrocyte-synapse proximity between striatal and hippocampal astrocytes. Unbiased evaluation of actively translated RNA and proteomic data confirmed significant astrocyte diversity between hippocampal and striatal circuits. We thus report core astrocyte properties, reveal evidence for specialized astrocytes within neural circuits, and provide new, integrated database resources and approaches to explore astrocyte diversity and function throughout the adult brain.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are potent therapeutic agents frequently used for treatment of number of conditions, including hematologic, inflammatory, and allergic diseases. Both their therapeutic and adverse effects display significant interindividual variation, partially attributable to genetic factors. We have previously isolated a seven-gene region of rat chromosome 8 sensitizing to dexamethasone (DEX)-induced dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (IR) of skeletal muscle. Using two newly derived congenic strains, we aimed to investigate the effect of one of the prime candidates for this pharmacogenetic interaction, the <i>Zbtb16</i> gene.	455	470	ORGAN	skeletal muscle	skeletal muscle
<b>Introduction:</b> Preparing primary care providers for genomic medicine (GM) first requires assessment of their educational needs in order to provide clear, purposeful direction and justify educational activities. More understanding is needed about primary care providers' perspectives on their role in newer areas of GM and what resources would be helpful in practice. Our objective was to determine family physicians' (FP) current involvement and confidence in GM, attitudes regarding its clinical value, suggestions for integration of GM into practice, and resources and education required. <b>Methods</b>: A self-complete anonymous questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 2,000 FPs in Ontario, Canada in September 2012. <b>Results:</b> Adjusted response rate was 26% (361/1,365), mean age was 51, and 53% were male. FPs reported many aspects of traditional GM as part of current practice (eliciting family history: 93%; deciding who to refer to genetics: 94%; but few reported confidence (44%, 32% respectively). Newer areas of GM were not part of most FPs' current practice and confidence was low (pharmacogenetics: 28% part of practice, 5% confident; direct-to-consumer genetic testing: 14%/2%; whole genome sequencing: 8%/2%). Attitudes were mixed with 59% agreeing that GM would improve patient health outcomes, 41% seeing benefits to genetic testing, but only 36% agreeing it was their responsibility to incorporate GM into practice. Few could identify useful sources of genetic information (22%) or find information about genetic tests (21%). Educational resources participants anticipated would be useful included contact information for local genetics clinics (89%), summaries of genetic disorders (86%), and genetic referral (85%) and testing (86%) criteria. About 58% were interested in learning about new genetic technologies. Most (76%) wanted to learn through in-person teaching (lectures, seminars etc.), 66% wanted contact with a local genetic counselor to answer questions, and 59% were interested in a genetics education website. <b>Conclusion</b>: FPs lack confidence in GM skills needed for practice, particularly in emerging areas of GM. They see their role as making appropriate referrals, are somewhat optimistic about the contribution GM may make to patient care, but express caution about its current clinical benefits. There is a need for evidence-based educational resources integrated into primary care and improved communication with genetic specialists.	1217	1223	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome
Owing to the advancement of technology combined with our deeper knowledge of human nature and diseases, we are able to move towards precision medicine, where patients are treated at the individual level in concordance with their genetic profiles. Lately, the integration of nanoparticles in biotechnology and their applications in medicine has allowed us to diagnose and treat disease better and more precisely. As a model disease, we used a grade IV malignant brain tumor (glioblastoma). Significant improvements in diagnosis were achieved with the application of fluorescent nanoparticles for intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allowing for improved tumor cell visibility and increasing the extent of the surgical resection, leading to better patient response. Fluorescent probes can be engineered to be activated through different molecular pathways, which will open the path to individualized glioblastoma diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. Nanoparticles are also extensively studied as nanovehicles for targeted delivery and more controlled medication release, and some nanomedicines are already in early phases of clinical trials. Moreover, sampling biological fluids will give new insights into glioblastoma pathogenesis due to the presence of extracellular vesicles, circulating tumor cells, and circulating tumor DNA. As current glioblastoma therapy does not provide good quality of life for patients, other approaches such as immunotherapy are explored. To conclude, we reason that development of personalized therapies based on a patient's genetic signature combined with pharmacogenomics and immunogenomic information will significantly change the outcome of glioblastoma patients.	274	287	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	nanoparticles	nanoparticles

Pharmacomicrobiomics and toxicomicrobiomics study how variations within the human microbiome (the combination of human-associated microbial communities and their genomes) affect drug disposition, action, and toxicity. These emerging fields, interconnecting microbiology, bioinformatics, systems pharmacology, and toxicology, complement pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics, expanding the scope of precision medicine. Areas covered: This article reviews some of the most recently reported pharmacomicrobiomic and toxicomicrobiomic interactions. Examples include the impact of the human gut microbiota on cardiovascular drugs, natural products, and chemotherapeutic agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although the gut microbiota has been the most extensively studied, some key drug-microbiome interactions involve vaginal, intratumoral, and environmental bacteria, and are briefly discussed here. Additionally, computational resources, moving the field from cataloging to predicting interactions, are introduced. Expert opinion: The rapid pace of discovery triggered by the Human Microbiome Project is moving pharmacomicrobiomic research from scattered observations to systematic studies focusing on screening microbiome variants against different drug classes. Better representation of all human populations will improve such studies by avoiding sampling bias, and the integration of multiomic studies with designed experiments will allow establishing causation. In the near future, pharmacomicrobiomic testing is expected to be a key step in screening novel drugs and designing precision therapeutics.	724	727	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	gut	gut

The recent accumulation of cancer genomic data provides an opportunity to understand how a tumor's genomic characteristics can affect its responses to drugs. This field, called pharmacogenomics, is a key area in the development of precision oncology. Deep learning (DL) methodology has emerged as a powerful technique to characterize and learn from rapidly accumulating pharmacogenomics data. We introduce the fundamentals and typical model architectures of DL. We review the use of DL in classification of cancers and cancer subtypes (diagnosis and treatment stratification of patients), prediction of drug response and drug synergy for individual tumors (treatment prioritization for a patient), drug repositioning and discovery and the study of mechanism/mode of action of treatments. For each topic, we summarize current genomics and pharmacogenomics data resources such as pan-cancer genomics data for cancer cell lines (CCLs) and tumors, and systematic pharmacologic screens of CCLs. By revisiting the published literature, including our in-house analyses, we demonstrate the unprecedented capability of DL enabled by rapid accumulation of data resources to decipher complex drug response patterns, thus potentially improving cancer medicine. Overall, this review provides an in-depth summary of state-of-the-art DL methods and up-to-date pharmacogenomics resources and future opportunities and challenges to realize the goal of precision oncology.	926	930	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	CCLs	CCLs

Severe hematotoxicity in patients with thiopurine therapy has been associated with genetic polymorphisms in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). While TPMT genetic testing is clinically implemented for dose individualization, alterations in the nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) emerged as independent determinant of thiopurine-related hematotoxicity. Because data for European patients are limited, we investigated the relevance of NUDT15 in Europeans.	39	49	AMINO_ACID	thiopurine	thiopurine
In patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, a P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonist, is the gold standard of antiplatelet therapy. Two more potent P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonists are now available. Pharmacodynamic studies have revealed a large interindividual variability in the biological response to clopidogrel that is primarily related to variable active metabolite generation, depending on clinical factors, drug-drug interactions, and genetic polymorphisms. Several assays to measure platelet function are available and have revealed a high prevalence of high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR). Patients exhibiting HTPR after a clopidogrel loading dose have a higher risk of thrombotic recurrence after percutaneous coronary intervention. A recent consensus has defined HTPR for the main platelet assays available (using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis) to define the optimal cutoff value for each assay in order to predict thrombotic recurrences. In this article, we present several lines of evidence that suggest a therapeutic window of platelet reactivity inhibition with P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonists. Such a paradigm shift is supported by the results of the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial and the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TRITON-TIMI) 38, which showed the superiority of ticagrelor and prasugrel on thrombotic events compared with clopidogrel; however, these 2 medications had an increased bleeding rate. With the results of these trials, in addition to the evidence of a therapeutic window with P2Y12 ADP receptor antagonists, we summarize the potential of platelet reactivity monitoring and pharmacogenomics to tailor therapy.	66	74	MULTI_TISSUE_STRUCTURE	coronary	coronary

The arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) genes encode enzymes that catalyze the N-acetylation of aromatic amines and hydrazines and the O-acetylation of heterocyclic amines. These genes, which play a key role in cellular homeostasis as well as in gene-environment interactions, are subject to marked pharmacogenetic variation, and different combinations of SNPs in the human NAT genes lead to different acetylation phenotypes. Our understanding of the consequences of pharmacogenetic variability in NATs has recently been enhanced by structural studies showing that effects on protein folding, aggregation and turnover, as well as direct changes in active site topology, are involved. These developments pave the way for a better understanding of the role played by NATs in maintaining cellular homeostasis. In addition, the NATs represent a model for studying fundamental processes associated with protein folding and pharmacogenomic effects mediated by inheritance in human populations across a polymorphic region of the genome.	1022	1028	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	genome	genome
Ever since the discovery of neural stem cells in the mammalian brain, the possibility of brain tissue regeneration has captured the minds of scientists, clinicians, and the public. Neural stem cells have been envisioned as a source of donor cells for transplantation and vectors for the delivery of gene therapy. Over the past decade, many researchers have contributed to characterizing these cells and their lineages, providing the foundation for their utilization as therapeutic devices. In a new study, Azim and colleagues took a different approach: using pharmacogenomics to focus on neural stem cell lineage, they identified specific compounds that can direct neural stem cell fate toward a specific lineage in vivo, both in physiological and pathological conditions. Their work opens new avenues for treatment of neurodegenerative and demyelinating disorders.	89	101	TISSUE	brain tissue	brain tissue
The statin class of cholesterol-lowering drugs have been used for decades to successfully lower plasma cholesterol concentrations and cardiovascular risk. Adverse effects of statins are generally considered mild, but increase with age of patients and polypharmacy. One aspect of statin therapy that is still difficult for prescribers to predict is the individual's response to statin therapy. Recent advances in the field of pharmacogenomics have indicated variants of candidate genes that affect statin efficacy and safety. In this review, a number of candidates that affect statin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are discussed. Some of these candidates, in particular those involved in import and efflux of statins, have now been linked to increased risk of side effects. Furthermore, pharmacogenomic studies continue to reveal new players that are involved in the fine-tuning of the complex regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and response to statins.	96	114	ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE	plasma cholesterol	plasma cholesterol

Priapism is a urologic emergency representing a true disorder of penile erection that persists beyond or is unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation. A variety of psychotropic drugs are known to produce priapism, albeit rarely, through their antagonistic action on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. We report such a case of priapism induced by a single oral dose of 10 mg aripiprazole, a drug with the least affinity to adrenergic receptors among all atypical antipsychotics. Polymorphism of alpha-2A adrenergic receptor gene in schizophrenia patients is known to be associated with sialorrhea while on clozapine treatment. Probably, similar polymorphism of alpha-1 adrenergic receptor gene could contribute to its altered sensitivity and resultant priapism. In future, pharmacogenomics-based approach may help in personalizing the treatment and effectively prevent the emergence of such side effects.	65	71	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	penile	penile

Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) investigate whether genetic polymorphisms associated with a phenotype are also associated with other diagnoses. In this study, we have developed new methods to perform a PheWAS based on ICD-10 codes and biological test results, and to use a quantitative trait as the selection criterion. We tested our approach on thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity in patients treated by thiopurine drugs. We developed 2 aggregation methods for the ICD-10 codes: an ICD-10 hierarchy and a mapping to existing ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes. Eleven biological test results were also analyzed using discretization algorithms. We applied these methods in patients having a TPMT activity assessment from the clinical data warehouse of a French academic hospital between January 2000 and July 2013. Data after initiation of thiopurine treatment were analyzed and patient groups were compared according to their TPMT activity level. A total of 442 patient records were analyzed representing 10,252 ICD-10 codes and 72,711 biological test results. The results from the ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes and ICD-10 hierarchy codes were concordant. Cross-validation with the biological test results allowed us to validate the ICD phenotypes. Iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus were associated with a very high TPMT activity (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.0015, respectively). We describe here an original method to perform PheWAS on a quantitative trait using both ICD-10 diagnosis codes and biological test results to identify associated phenotypes. In the field of pharmacogenomics, PheWAS allow for the identification of new subgroups of patients who require personalized clinical and therapeutic management.	854	864	AMINO_ACID	thiopurine	thiopurine
A wide interindividual variability in survival after cancer treatment is observed. This is attributable to many factors, including tumour and patient related factors. Genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters may be one of these factors. Drug metabolising enzymes are responsible for the activation, inactivation and detoxification of many chemotherapeutic agents. Deficiencies in these enzymes may result in altered exposure (both extracellular and intracellular) to the chemotherapeutic agents, thereby influencing the efficacy of treatment. Drug transporters are important in the uptake and excretion of chemotherapeutic agents. Polymorphisms in drug transporter genes may influence the bioavailability and disposition of these agents. Studies have shown that variability in survival can (partly) be explained by polymorphisms in genes encoding drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters. This review will discuss the role of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters in relation to survival after cancer treatment. The most important polymorphisms shown to influence survival after cancer treatment are polymorphisms in the genes encoding the phase II detoxification enzymes glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). It appears that GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null have a clear association with longer overall survival in patients with different malignancies who are treated with substrates for these GSTs (mostly alkylating agents and platinum compounds). Genetic polymorphisms in GSTP1 and GSTA1 are also associated with an increased overall survival in patients with different malignancies. Most of the current data on the relation between treatment response and pharmacogenetics is derived from retrospective and exploratory studies. Prospective studies will be necessary.	463	476	IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY	extracellular	extracellular

Drug attrition rates have increased in past years, resulting in growing costs for the pharmaceutical industry and consumers. The reasons for this include the lack of in vitro models that correlate with clinical results and poor preclinical toxicity screening assays. The in vitro production of human cardiac progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells provides an amenable source of cells for applications in drug discovery, disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and cardiotoxicity screening. In addition, the ability to derive human-induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic tissues, combined with current high-throughput screening and pharmacogenomics, may help realize the use of these cells to fulfill the potential of personalized medicine. In this review, we discuss the use of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes for drug discovery and cardiotoxicity screening, as well as current hurdles that must be overcome for wider clinical applications of this promising approach.	599	614	TISSUE	somatic tissues	somatic tissues
Nicotine dependence has deleterious neurological impacts. Previous studies found an association between cigarette smoking and accelerating age-related thinning of the brain's cortex and subsequent cognitive decline. Smoking is considered the third most common risk factor for dementia, which prompted the inclusion of smoking cessation in dementia prevention strategies. Traditional pharmacologic options for smoking cessation include nicotine transdermal patches, bupropion and varenicline. However, based on smokers' genetic makeup, pharmacogenetics can be used to develop novel therapies to replace these traditional approaches. Genetic variability of cytochrome P450 2A6 has a major impact on smokers' behavior and their response to quitting therapies. Gene polymorphism in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits also has a great influence on the ability to quit smoking. In addition, polymorphism of certain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors was found to affect the risk of dementia and the impact of tobacco smoking on the development of Alzheimer's disease. Nicotine dependence involves the activation of pleasure response through the stimulation of dopamine release. Central dopamine receptors, catechol-o-methyltransferase and the dopamine transporter protein, regulate synaptic dopamine levels. The genes of these molecules are potential targets for novel smoking cessation drugs. Pharmacogenetic studies of smoking cessation also investigated other molecules, such as ANKK1 and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). In this perspective article, we aim to highlight the promising role of pharmacogenetics in the development of effective drugs for smoking cessation, which can increase the success rate of smoking quitting plans and ultimately reduce the incidence of neurodegeneration and dementia.	167	172	ORGAN	brain	brain

The proven therapeutic efficacy of methadone in cancer pain is hindered by a challenging pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile, considerable interpatient variation, and increasing concern about the complexities of dosing. The objective of this study was to assess the evidence for the use of methadone in cancer pain management. The authors conducted a systematic literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published post the 2007 Cochrane review of methadone in cancer pain. Trial quality was assessed using the Oxford Quality Scoring System and Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Of the 152 abstracts found, 4 were RCTs (272 participants). Two RCTs compared the efficacy and safety of methadone with placebo or active control and two investigated rotation to methadone from other opioids. The studies used different routes of administration, dosing, initiation, and titration of methadone and distinct pain scoring tools and did not address the issues raised by the Cochrane review. Methadone has an important role in the management of cancer pain, with many advantages including low cost, high oral bioavailability, rapid onset of action, once-daily dosing, and postulated benefits in difficult pain control scenarios. However, due to limited research in this area, methadone dosing remains a challenge, with vigilant dose initiation, adjustment, and monitoring required. There is a need for further studies using standardized methodology to evaluate the optimal dosing strategy of methadone, the effect on different types of pain, and the role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics in clinical outcomes.	1138	1142	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral	oral
FSH brings about its physiological actions by activating a specific receptor located on target cells. Normal functioning of the FSH receptor (FSHR) is crucial for follicular development and estradiol production in females and for the regulation of Sertoli cell function and spermatogenesis in males. In the last two decades, the number of inactivating and activating mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and spliced variants of FSHR gene has been identified in selected infertile cases. Information on genotype-phenotype correlation and in vitro functional characterization of the mutants has helped in understanding the possible genetic cause for female infertility in affected individuals. The information is also being used to dissect various extracellular and intracellular events involved in hormone-receptor interaction by studying the differences in the properties of the mutant receptor when compared with WT receptor. Studies on polymorphisms in the FSHR gene have shown variability in clinical outcome among women treated with FSH. These observations are being explored to develop molecular markers to predict the optimum dose of FSH required for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Pharmacogenetics is an emerging field in this area that aims at designing individual treatment protocols for reproductive abnormalities based on FSHR gene polymorphisms. The present review discusses the current knowledge of various genetic alterations in FSHR and their impact on receptor function in the female reproductive system.	163	173	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	follicular	follicular

<b>Background:</b> Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are a major clinical problem accounting for significant hospital admission rates, morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. One-third of people with diabetes experience at least one ADR. However, there is notable interindividual heterogeneity resulting in patient harm and unnecessary medical costs. Genomics is at the forefront of research to understand interindividual variability, and there are many genotype-drug response associations in diabetes with inconsistent findings. Here, we conducted a systematic review to comprehensively examine and synthesize the effect of genetic polymorphisms on the incidence of ADRs of oral glucose-lowering drugs in people with type 2 diabetes. <b>Methods:</b> A literature search was made to identify articles that included specific results of research on genetic polymorphism and adverse effects associated with oral glucose-lowering drugs. The electronic search was carried out on 3rd October 2020, through Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science using keywords and MeSH terms. <b>Result:</b> Eighteen articles consisting of 10, 383 subjects were included in this review. Carriers of reduced-function alleles of organic cation transporter 1 (OCT 1, encoded by <i>SLC22A1</i>) or reduced expression alleles of plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT, encoded by <i>SLC29A4</i>) or serotonin transporter (SERT, encoded by <i>SLC6A4</i>) were associated with increased incidence of metformin-related gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects.

Stroke is a disease with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic and social impacts. It is a complex entity whose pathogenesis involves multiple environmental and genetic factors, with the latter having a role in up to 50% of strokes. The objective of the review is to analyze the available methods for the genetic diagnosis including linkage studies of variation in copy number, gene - candidate approximations, or whole genome (GWAS) and polymorphisms associated with its pathogenesis. We describe several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with stroke in association studies and GWAS such as SNPs of angiotensin, the aldosterone system, paraoxonases, nitric oxide, coagulation, and fibrinolysis system, among others. We also analyze the role of certain polymorphisms in the phenotype of the carotid plaque, intracranial aneurysms and lobar hemorrhages. Pharmacogenomic aspects in which SNPs affect the response and safety regarding the use of different drugs are also described. Several SNPs that significantly contribute to the risk of stroke are also described. The advent of techniques like GWAS has contributed to the understanding of genetics and pharmacogenomics of stroke.	816	823	TISSUE	carotid	carotid

Gabapentinoids are substrate of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) for distribution across the blood-brain barrier. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of LAT1 rs4240803 genetic polymorphism on the clinical efficacy and tolerability of gabapentinoids in Pakistani patients with neuropathic pain. Three-hundred and ninety-two patients were recruited, genotyped for SNP rs4240803, and followed up for eight weeks to evaluate the clinical response to gabapentinoids in terms of pain relief, inadequate response, and the emergence of adverse events. LAT1 rs4240803 GG, GA, and AA genotype frequency were 33.42%, 47.96% and 18.62%, respectively. Out of 392 patients, 323 responded to the treatment and 17.6% discontinued either due to insufficient response or intolerable adverse events (AEs). GA genotype was more frequent in non-responder group (P ˂ 0.001). Maximum pain responders (≥50%) in combination with the lowest incidence of AEs were observed in the GG group, whereas partial responders belonged to GA genotype and with the highest frequency of somnolence (83.6%) and dizziness (69.9%). Overall, 72.5% patients with GA genotype experienced AEs (P ˂ 0.001). In conclusion, clinical outcomes of gabapentinoids are influenced by LAT1 rs4240803 polymorphism and population pharmacogenetics should be considered to evaluate the maximum potential of gabapentinoids in the management of neuropathic pain.	99	118	TISSUE	blood-brain barrier	blood-brain barrier
Analysis of drug-induced gene expression in the brain has long held the promise of revealing the molecular mechanisms of drug actions as well as predicting their long-term clinical efficacy. However, despite some successes, this promise has yet to be fulfilled. Here, we present an overview of the current state of understanding of drug-induced gene expression in the brain and consider the obstacles to achieving a robust prediction of the properties of psychoactive compounds based on gene expression profiles. We begin with a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms controlling drug-inducible transcription and the complexity resulting from expression of noncoding RNAs and alternative gene isoforms. Particular interest is placed on studies that examine the associations within drug classes with regard to the effects on gene transcription, alterations in cell signaling and neuropharmacological drug properties. While the ability of gene expression signatures to distinguish specific clinical classes of psychotropic and addictive drugs remains unclear, some reports show that under specific constraints, drug properties can be predicted based on gene expression. Such signatures offer a simple and effective way to classify psychotropic drugs and screen novel psychoactive compounds. Finally, we note that the amount of data regarding molecular programs activated in the brain by drug treatment has grown exponentially in recent years and that future advances may therefore come in large part from integrating the currently available high-throughput data sets.	48	53	ORGAN	brain	brain

Patients presenting with degenerative spinal changes are often poor surgical candidates due to associated co-morbidities, frailty, or sarcopenia. Additionally, surgeries of a degenerative spine can prove difficult due to the distortion of normal surgical anatomy. Therefore, many patients are managed conservatively with a variety of modalities, including over-the-counter and prescription medications. Nevertheless, several patients do not experience adequate relief from pain with analgesic medications, precipitating multiple hospital visits, and usage of resources. As a result, back pain is regarded as a major economic burden, with total costs of associated treatment exceeding $100 billion annually. Pharmacogenetics is a relatively novel method of evaluating an individual's response to analgesic medications, through analysis of germline polymorphisms. It entails obtaining a genetic sample, often via buccal swab or peripheral blood sample, and genetic analysis achieved through either polymerase chain reaction +/- Sanger sequencing, microassays, restriction length fragment polymorphism analysis, or genetic library preparation and next generation sequencing. The potential efficacy of pharmacogenetic analysis has been highlighted across several specialities to date. However, a paucity of evidence exists regarding spine surgery populations. Nevertheless, regular prospective pharmacogenetic analysis may ultimately prove beneficial when concerning degenerative spinal cohorts due to aforementioned surgical and economic considerations. The purpose of this narrative review is to outline how metaboliser profile variants affect the pharmacokinetics of specific analgesia used to treat back pain, and to discuss the current potential and limitations of employing regular pharmacogenetic analysis for spine surgery populations with degenerative conditions.	38	44	ORGAN	spinal	spinal

Screening potential drug-drug interactions, drug-gene interactions, contraindications, and other factors is crucial in clinical practice. However, implementing these screening concepts in real-world settings poses challenges. This work proposes an approach towards precision medicine that combines genetic and nongenetic factors to facilitate clinical decision-making. The approach focuses on raising the performance of four potential interaction screenings in the prescribing process, including drug-drug interactions, drug-gene interactions, drug-herb interactions, drug-social lifestyle interactions, and two potential considerations for patients with liver or renal impairment. The work describes the design of a curated knowledge-based model called the knowledge model for potential interaction and consideration screening, the screening logic for both the detection module and inference module, and the personalized prescribing report. Three case studies have demonstrated the proof-of-concept and effectiveness of this approach. The proposed approach aims to reduce decision-making processes for healthcare professionals, reduce medication-related harm, and enhance treatment effectiveness. Additionally, the recommendation with a semantic network is suggested to assist in risk-benefit analysis when health professionals plan therapeutic interventions with new medicines that have insufficient evidence to establish explicit recommendations. This approach offers a promising solution to implementing precision medicine in clinical practice.	655	660	ORGAN	liver	liver
The complete sequence of the human genome and subsequent intensive searches for polymorphic variations are providing the prerequisite markers necessary to facilitate elucidation of the genetic variability in drug responses. Improvements in the sensitivity and precision of DNA microarrays permit a detailed and accurate scrutiny of the human genome. These advances have the potential to significantly improve health care management by improving disease diagnosis and targeting molecular therapy. Pharmacogenetic approaches, in limited use today, will become an integral part of therapeutic monitoring and health management, permitting patient stratification in advance of treatments, with the potential to eliminate adverse drug reactions. In this chapter, the current state of biochip technology is discussed, and recent applications in the arena of clinic diagnostics are explored.	273	276	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA
Eslicarbazepine acetate is a third-generation anti-epileptic prodrug quickly and extensively transformed to eslicarbazepine after oral administration. Reduction in seizure frequency in patients managed with eslicarbazepine is only partial in the majority of patients and many of them suffer considerable ADRs that require a change of treatment. The P-glycoprotein, encoded by the ABCB1 gene, is expressed throughout the body and can impact the pharmacokinetics of several drugs. In terms of epilepsy treatment, this transporter was linked to drug-resistant epilepsy, as it conditions drug access into the brain due to its expression at the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of three ABCB1 common polymorphisms (i.e., C3435T, or rs1045642, G2677A or rs2032582 and C1236T or rs1128503) in the pharmacokinetics and safety of eslicarbazepine. For this purpose, 22 healthy volunteers participating in a bioequivalence clinical trial were recruited. No significant relationship was observed between sex, race and ABCB1 polymorphism and eslicarbazepine pharmacokinetic variability. In contrast, ABCB1 C1236T C/C diplotype was significantly related to the occurrence of ADRs: one volunteer with this genotype suffered dizziness, somnolence and hand paresthesia, while no other volunteer suffered any of these ADRs (p < 0.045). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study published to date evaluating eslicarbazepine pharmacogenetics. Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to compare the results obtained here.	130	134	ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION	oral	oral

Preterm birth (PTB) is a large public health problem in the United States and worldwide. There is a clear genetic component to the pathogenesis of PTB, as evidenced by twin studies, heritability studies, and investigations from large population databases. Although numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with PTB, results have been inconsistent and overall disappointing. With recent advances in genetic technology, investigations are moving beyond simple, more traditional candidate gene studies, and have expanded to encompass more exploratory analyses using high-throughput genetic techniques. Care should be taken to consider the potential impact of fetal genotype, the environment, and gene-drug interactions (pharmacogenomics) in addition to maternal genotype. Future research should capitalize on evolving analytic techniques, including pathway analyses and correlation of genetic and functional data to optimize discovery, increase knowledge regarding prematurity pathogenesis, and begin to develop novel therapeutic strategies.	677	682	TISSUE	fetal	fetal
Precision medicine has the potential to have a significant impact on both drug development and patient care. It is crucial to not only provide prompt effective antiseizure treatment for critically ill patients after seizures start but also have a proactive mindset and concentrate on epileptogenesis and the underlying cause of the seizures or seizure disorders. Critical illness presents different treatment issues compared with the ambulatory population, which makes it challenging to choose the best antiseizure medications and to administer them at the right time and at the right dose. Since there is a paucity of information available on antiseizure medication dosing in critically ill patients, therapeutic drug monitoring is a useful tool for defining each patient's personal therapeutic range and assisting clinicians in decision-making. Use of pharmacogenomic information relating to pharmacokinetics, hepatic metabolism, and seizure etiology may improve safety and efficacy by individualizing therapy. Studies evaluating the clinical implementation of pharmacogenomic information at the point-of-care and identification of biomarkers are also needed. These studies may make it possible to avoid adverse drug reactions, maximize drug efficacy, reduce drug-drug interactions, and optimize medications for each individual patient. This review will discuss the available literature and provide future insights on precision medicine use with antiseizure therapy in critically ill adult patients.	912	919	PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION	hepatic	hepatic
This study evaluated the timing, use, and clinical outcomes of the GeneFolio® Pharmacogenomic Panel in a healthcare setting with patients managed by primary care providers or by psychiatrists. Participants were randomized to receive a pharmacogenetics report at four weeks or 12 weeks. After DNA collection and genetic analysis, pharmacists produced a recommendation report which was given to providers at the randomization week. The four-week group decreased depression severity (PHQ-9 and BDI) faster than the 12-week group (p = 0.0196), and psychiatrists' patients decreased their depression severity faster than primary care patients (PHQ-9 p = 0.0005, BDI p = 0.0218). Mean mental quality of life increased over time (p < 0.0001), but it increased slower for patients taking drugs in the Significant drug-drug-gene interaction category (p = 0.0012). Mental quality of life, depression severity, and clinical outcomes were improved by GeneFolio® pharmacogenomic testing regardless of provider type, with earlier testing improving outcomes sooner.	292	295	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA
Pharmacogenomics, the study of the role of genetics in drug response, has recently become a focal point of research. Previous studies showed that genes associated with drug detoxification vary among different populations. However, pharmacogenomic information of the Zhuang ethnic group is scarce. The aim of the present study was to screen members of the Zhuang ethnicity in southwestern China for genotype frequencies of very important pharmacogenomic (VIP) variants and to determine the differences between the Zhuang ethnicity and other human populations.We genotyped 80 variants of VIP genes in 100 unrelated healthy Zhuang adults from the Yunnan province of China. Next, we analyzed the genotyping data with Structure and F-statistics (Fst).We compared our data with those of other populations using the HapMap data set, and observed that the frequency distribution of Zhuang population in Yunnan closely resembles that of JPT. Furthermore, population structure and Fst analysis showed that the Zhuang population is closely related to the Shaanxi Han population with respect to genetic background.Our study supplements existing information on Zhuang population pharmacogenomics and provides an extensive overview for developing personalized medicine.	928	931	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	JPT	JPT

Drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions are of major medical concern because they are associated with high morbidity and high mortality. In addition, individual patients' reactions are impossible to predict in each patient. In the field of severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cutaneous ADR) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DHIS) or drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), major advances have recently been gained through studies of an association between HLA alleles and drug hypersensitivity induced by specific drugs. The results of these pharmacogenomic studies allow prediction of the risk of adverse reactions in patients treated with certain drugs, including carbamazepine and other aromatic antiepileptic drugs, allopurinol and abacavir. However, different ethnic populations show variations in the genetic associations. A strong association between carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN and HLA-B*1502 has been found in Southeast Asian patients but not in Caucasian and Japanese patients. Moderate associations between aromatic amine anticonvulsants and other HLA alleles have been proposed in Japanese patients. In contrast, HLA-B*5801 was found to be associated with allopurinol-induced cutaneous ADR, including SJS/TEN and DIHS/DRESS, in Caucasian and Asian patients, including the Japanese. These differences may, at least in part, be due to the differences in allele frequency in different ethnic populations. This article reviews the progress in pharmacogenomics, associated mainly with carbamazepine and allopurinol in different ethnic populations. Pharmacogenetic screening based on associations between adverse reactions and specific HLA alleles helps to avoid serious conditions associated with drug hypersensitivity.	342	351	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	epidermal	epidermal

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system, often resulting in significant disability in early adulthood. The field of pharmacogenomics holds promise in distinguishing responders from non-responders to drug treatment. Most studies on genetic polymorphisms in MS have addressed treatment with interferon-β, yet few findings have been replicated. This review outlines the barriers that currently hinder the validity, reproducibility, and inter-study comparison of pharmacogenomics research as it relates to the use of interferon-β. Notably, statistical power, varying definitions of responder status, varying assay and genotyping methodologies, and anti-interferon-β neutralizing antibodies significantly confound existing data. Future work should focus on addressing these factors in order to optimize interferon-β treatment outcomes in MS.	57	79	ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM	central nervous system	central nervous system
Gemcitabine is an antimetabolite ranking among the most prescribed anticancer drugs worldwide. This nucleoside analog exerts its antiproliferative action after tumoral conversion into active triphosphorylated nucleotides interfering with DNA synthesis and targeting ribonucleotide reductase. Gemcitabine is a mainstay for treating pancreatic and lung cancers, alone or in combination with several cytotoxic drugs (nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin and oxaliplatin), and is an option in a variety of other solid or hematological cancers. Several determinants of response have been identified with gemcitabine, i.e., membrane transporters, activating and inactivating enzymes at the tumor level, or Hedgehog signaling pathway. More recent studies have investigated how germinal genetic polymorphisms affecting cytidine deaminase, the enzyme responsible for the liver disposition of gemcitabine, could act as well as a marker for clinical outcome (i.e., toxicity, efficacy) at the bedside. Besides, constant efforts have been made to develop alternative chemical derivatives or encapsulated forms of gemcitabine, as an attempt to improve its metabolism and pharmacokinetics profile. Overall, gemcitabine is a drug paradigmatic for constant searches of the scientific community to improve its administration through the development of personalized medicine in oncology.	238	241	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	DNA	DNA

Besides, constant efforts have been made to develop alternative chemical derivatives or encapsulated forms of gemcitabine, as an attempt to improve its metabolism and pharmacokinetics profile. Overall, gemcitabine is a drug paradigmatic for constant searches of the scientific community to improve its administration through the development of personalized medicine in oncology.	607	615	CELLULAR_COMPONENT	membrane	membrane
Gemcitabine is an antimetabolite ranking among the most prescribed anticancer drugs worldwide. This nucleoside analog exerts its antiproliferative action after tumoral conversion into active triphosphorylated nucleotides interfering with DNA synthesis and targeting ribonucleotide reductase. Gemcitabine is a mainstay for treating pancreatic and lung cancers, alone or in combination with several cytotoxic drugs (nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin and oxaliplatin), and is an option in a variety of other solid or hematological cancers.

In the perioperative setting, there is still a high incidence of adverse cardiac events due to sudden coronary plaque rupture or oxygen supply-demand imbalance. β-Blockers play an important role in preventing these cardiac events. Discussion, however, remains on the side effects accompanying this therapy.	73	80	ORGAN	cardiac	cardiac
