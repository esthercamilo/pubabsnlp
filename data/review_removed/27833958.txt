Clinical importance of pharmacogenetics in the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection.
Globally, over 4% of the world population is affected by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The current standard of care for hepatitis C infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks, which yield a sustained virological response in only a little over half of the patients with genotype 1 HCV. We investigated the clinical importance of pharmacogenetics in treatment efficacy and prediction of hematotoxicity. A total of 148 patients infected with HCV were enrolled. All patients were treated for a period of 48 weeks or less with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Four genotypes were investigated: inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) rs1127354, C20orf194 rs6051702, interferon lambda (IFNL)3 rs8099917, IFNL3รท4 rs12979860 in the population from southwestern Romania. Genetic variants for rs129798660 and rs6051702 proved once more to represent an indisputable clinical tool for predicting sustained virological response (SVR) (69.23%, chi-square p=0.007846, p<0.05 and 63.29%, chi-square p=0.007846, p<0.05, respectively). ITPA genetic variants protect against ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia and C20orf194 also proved to be protective against thrombocytopenia. These clinical findings strengthen the belief that pharmacogenetics should play a constant role in treatment decisions for patients infected with hepatitis C virus.
