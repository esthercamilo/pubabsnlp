Study of the Association of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Candidate Genes With Sevoflurane.
The susceptibility of different individuals to anesthetics varies widely, and sevoflurane is no exception. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in genes involved in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may explain this variation. A total of 151 individuals undergoing otorhinolaryngology surgery were included. The influence of genetic polymorphisms on sevoflurane sensitivity were investigated through SNaPshot technology. Individuals carrying KCNK2 rs6686529 G > C, MTRR rs3733784 TT, rs2307116 GG, or rs1801394 AA polymorphisms had a higher sensitivity to the sedative effect of sevoflurane than those without those polymorphisms. The univariate linear regression analysis indicated that MTRR rs3733784 TT, rs2307116 GG, and rs1801394 AA were potentially significant predictors of higher sensitivity to the sedative effect of sevoflurane. Moreover, CYP2E1 rs3813867 G > C and rs2031920 C > T, GABRG1 rs279858 T > C, KCNK3 rs1275988 CC, GRIN2B rs1806201 GG, MTRR rs2307116 G > A, and rs1801394 A > G were associated with a higher sensitivity to the cardiovascular effect of sevoflurane. Our results suggested that 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in metabolizing enzymes, transport proteins, target proteins of sevoflurane and folate metabolism may help to explain individual differences in the susceptibility to the sedative or cardiovascular effect of sevoflurane.
