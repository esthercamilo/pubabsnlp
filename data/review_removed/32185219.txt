Association of SCN1A, SCN2A, and UGT2B7 Polymorphisms with Responsiveness to Valproic Acid in the Treatment of Epilepsy.
The efficacy of valproic acid (VPA) varies widely in clinical treatment of epileptic patients. Our study is aimed at exploring a potential association between polymorphisms of SCN1A, SCN2A, and UGT2B7 genetic factors and VPA responses.
