Responsible Radionuclide Cancer Care.
The landscape of nuclear oncology is rapidly changing. The advent of molecular radionuclide theranostics, multidisciplinary tumor board decision making, artificial intelligence and radiomics interpretation of diagnostic imaging, evolution of pharmacogenomics prediction of tumor response, and regulatory requirements for prospective individual dosimetry are just some of the elements which are broadening the essence of physician responsibility. The burgeoning knowledge base essential for mastering the emergent technologies, and their profound effect on moral philosophic aspects of provision of cancer care, are challenging. The new relationship of the theranostic nuclear physician with respect to shared care of the individual patient, particularly with regard to transparency, accountability, and responsibility for targeted radionuclide diagnosis and therapy of cancer, will be explored in this update.
