Vitamin D pathway gene polymorphisms affecting daclatasvir plasma concentration at 2 weeks and 1 month of therapy.
Vitamin D (VD) influences genetic expression through its receptor (VDR). VD pathway gene polymorphisms seem to influence antiviral drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcome/toxicity. We investigated the association between daclatasvir (DCV) plasma concentrations and genetic variants (SNPs) associated with the VD pathway.
