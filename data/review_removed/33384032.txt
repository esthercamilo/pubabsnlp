Tacrolimus-Induced Bradykinesia Secondary to Phenoconversion in an Elderly Post-Bilateral Lung Transplant Patient.
<b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To report pharmacogenomics post-related bradykinesia secondary to phenoconversion in an elderly post-bilateral lung transplant patient.<b>SUMMARY:</b> The patient was a 68-year-old double lung transplant patient taking the immunosuppressant and CYP3A4/5 substrate tacrolimus concomitantly with 2 CYP3A4/5 inhibitor medications, fluconazole and diltiazem. This drug combination post-dosing resulted in debilitating bradykinesia 1-2 hours after dosing, increasing the risk of falls and possible increased mortality and morbidity risk.<b>CONCLUSION:</b> Taking tacrolimus in combination with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors may increase neurologic adverse effects resulting in increased fall and associated increased mortality and morbidity risk.
