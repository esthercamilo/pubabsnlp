Relevance of <i>NR1I2</i> variants on carbamazepine therapy in Mexican Mestizos with epilepsy at a tertiary-care hospital.
<b>Aim:</b> We evaluated the potential influence of genetic (<i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>EPHX1</i>, <i>NR1I2</i>, <i>HNF4A</i>, <i>ABCC2</i>, <i>RALBP1</i>, <i>SCN1A</i>, <i>SCN2A</i> and <i>GABRA1</i>) and nongenetic factors on carbamazepine (CBZ) response, adverse drug reactions and CBZ plasma concentrations in 126 Mexican Mestizos (MM) with epilepsy. <b>Subjects & methods:</b> Patients were genotyped for 27 variants using TaqMan<sup>®</sup> assays. <b>Results:</b> CBZ response was associated with <i>NR1I2</i> variants and lamotrigine cotreatment. CBZ-induced adverse drug reactions were related to antiepileptic polytherapy and <i>SCN1A</i> rs2298771/rs3812718 haplotype. CBZ plasma concentrations were influenced by <i>NR1I2</i>-rs2276707 and -rs3814058, and by phenytoin cotreatment. CBZ daily dose was also influenced by <i>NR1I2</i>-rs3814055 and <i>EPHX1</i>-rs1051740. <b>Conclusion:</b> Interindividual variability in CBZ treatment was partly explained by <i>NR1I2</i>, <i>EPHX1</i> and <i>SCN1A</i> variants, as well as antiepileptic cotreatment in MM with epilepsy.
