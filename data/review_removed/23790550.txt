Pharmacogenomics and heart failure in congenital heart disease.
Congenital heart disease (CHD) constitutes a lifelong challenge in heart failure management. Current therapy is based mainly on physiologic principles extrapolated from the management of left ventricular failure in adult populations with either ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy. However, there is good evidence of genomic variability in the origin and progression of CHD that suggests the need for a individualized approach to treatment. The developing science of pharmacogenomics presents an opportunity for CHD management broadly, and especially in the context of heart failure. There is growing evidence that individualizing drug therapy for these patients might be beneficial, and that prediction of response to therapy might be possible by incorporating genomic data into the treatment algorithm for individual patients.
