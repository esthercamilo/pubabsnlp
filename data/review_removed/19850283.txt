Identification of novel candidate genes for treatment response to risperidone and susceptibility for schizophrenia: integrated analysis among pharmacogenomics, mouse expression, and genetic case-control association approaches.
Pharmacogenomic approaches based on genomewide sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are now feasible and offer the potential to uncover variants that influence drug response.
