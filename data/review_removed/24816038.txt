In search for genetic determinants of clinically meaningful differential cardiovascular event reduction by pravastatin in the PHArmacogenetic study of Statins in the Elderly at risk (PHASE)/PROSPER study.
Statin therapy is widely used in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular events and is associated with significant risk reductions. However, there is considerable variation in response to statin therapy both in terms of LDL cholesterol reduction and clinical outcomes. It has been hypothesized that genetic variation contributes importantly to this individual drug response.
