Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines for HLA-B genotype and carbamazepine dosing.
Human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B) is a gene that encodes a cell surface protein involved in presenting antigens to the immune system. The variant allele HLA-B*15:02 is associated with an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in response to carbamazepine treatment. We summarize evidence from the published literature supporting this association and provide recommendations for the use of carbamazepine based on HLA-B genotype (also available on PharmGKB: http://www.pharmgkb.org). The purpose of this article is to provide information to allow the interpretation of clinical HLA-B*15:02 genotype tests so that the results can be used to guide the use of carbamazepine. The guideline provides recommendations for the use of carbamazepine when HLA-B*15:02 genotype results are available. Detailed guidelines regarding the selection of alternative therapies, the use of phenotypic tests, when to conduct genotype testing, and cost-effectiveness analyses are beyond the scope of this document. Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines are published and updated periodically on the PharmGKB website at (http://www.pharmgkb.org).
