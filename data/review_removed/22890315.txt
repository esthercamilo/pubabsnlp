Association between the 5-HT1A receptor gene polymorphism (rs6295) and antidepressants: a meta-analysis.
Previous studies have implicated 5-HT1A receptor gene (HTR1A) polymorphisms in the therapeutic response to antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A functional HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism (rs6295) in the promoter region was found to be associated with antidepressant pharmacogenetics in different populations. However, inconsistent and inconclusive results have been obtained. In this study, we tested whether rs6295 genetic variants are related to antidepressant effects using a meta-analysis method. The relevant literature was acquired through deliberate searching and selection based on the established inclusion criteria for publications. A total of 10 articles were identified, all of which evaluated the HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism and antidepressant response. Dominant and recessive models were tested in the analyses, and the results revealed no association between the HTR1A C-1019G polymorphism and antidepressant response.
