Genetic and Molecular Aspects of Drug-Induced QT Interval Prolongation.
Long QT syndromes can be either acquired or congenital. Drugs are one of the many etiologies that may induce acquired long QT syndrome. In fact, many drugs frequently used in the clinical setting are a known risk factor for a prolonged QT interval, thus increasing the chances of developing torsade de pointes. The molecular mechanisms involved in the prolongation of the QT interval are common to most medications. However, there is considerable inter-individual variability in drug response, thus making the application of personalized medicine a relevant aspect in long QT syndrome, in order to evaluate the risk of every individual from a pharmacogenetic standpoint.
