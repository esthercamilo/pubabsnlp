Negative symptoms in schizophrenia: correlation with clinical and genetic factors.
<b>Aim:</b> Explore the possible association between clinical factors and genetic variants of the dopamine pathways and negative symptoms. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Negative symptoms were assessed in 206 patients with schizophrenia using the Arabic version of the self-evaluation of negative symptoms scale and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Genotyping for <i>COMT</i>, <i>DRD2</i>, <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>OPRM1</i> genes was performed. <b>Results:</b> Multivariable analysis showed that higher self-evaluation of negative symptoms scale scores were significantly associated with higher age, higher chlorpromazine-equivalent daily dose for typical antipsychotics and in married patients. Higher negative Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores were significantly associated with women and having the CT genotype for <i>MTHFR</i> c.677C>T (β = 4.25; p = 0.008) compared with CC patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Understanding both clinical/genetic factors could help improve the treatment of patients.
