Azathioprine dose tailoring based on pharmacogenetic information: Insights of clinical implementation.
Azathioprine is commonly used as an immunosuppressive antimetabolite in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, autoimmune disorders (such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis), and in patients receiving organ transplants. Thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is a cytoplasmic trans-methylase catalyzing the S-methylation of thiopurines. The active metabolites obtained from thiopurines are hydrolyzed into inactive forms by the Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15). The TPMT*2 (defined by rs1800462), *3A (defined by rs1800460 and rs1142345), *3B (defined by rs1800460), *3C (defined by rs1142345), *6 (defined by rs75543815), and NUDT15 rs116855232 genetic variant have been associated, with the highest level of evidence, with the response to azathioprine, and, the approved drug label for azathioprine and main pharmacogenetic dosing guidelines recommend starting with reduced initial doses in TPMT intermediate metabolizer (IM) patients and considering an alternative treatment in TPMT poor metabolizer (PM) patients. This study aims to assess the clinical impact of azathioprine dose tailoring based on TPMT genotyping studying the azathioprine toxicity and efficacy, treatment starts, and dose adjustments during follow-up, comparing TPMT IM/PM and normal metabolizer (NM) patients. It also studied the association of NUDT15 rs116855232 with response to azathioprine in patients receiving a tailored treatment based on TPMT and characterized the TMPT and NUDT15 studied variants in our population. Results show that azathioprine dose reduction in TPMT IM patients (TPMT*1/*2, *1/*3A, or *1/*3C genotypes) is related to lower toxicity events compared to TPMT NM (TPMT *1/*1 genotype), and lower azathioprine dose adjustments during follow-up without showing differences in the efficacy. The results support the hypothesis of existing other genetic variants affecting azathioprine toxicity.
