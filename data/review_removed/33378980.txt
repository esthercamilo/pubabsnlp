Impact of polymorphisms in transporter and metabolizing enzyme genes on olanzapine pharmacokinetics and safety in healthy volunteers.
Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic widely used for the treatment of schizophrenia, which often causes serious adverse drug reactions. Currently, there are no clinical guidelines implementing pharmacogenetic information on olanzapine. Moreover, the Dutch Pharmacogenomics Working Group (DPWG) states that CYP2D6 phenotype is not related to olanzapine response or side effects. Thus, the objective of this candidate-gene study was to investigate the effect of 72 polymorphisms in 21 genes on olanzapine pharmacokinetics and safety, including transporters (e.g. ABCB1, ABCC2, SLC22A1), receptors (e.g. DRD2, HTR2C), and enzymes (e.g. UGT, CYP and COMT), in a cohort of healthy volunteers. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9, SLC22A1, ABCB1, ABCC2, and APOC3 were related to olanzapine pharmacokinetic variability. The incidence of adverse reactions was related to several genes: palpitations to ABCB1 and SLC22A1, asthenia to ABCB1, somnolence to DRD2 and ABCB1, and dizziness to CYP2C9. However, further studies in patients are warranted to confirm the influence of these genetic polymorphisms on olanzapine pharmacokinetics and tolerability.
