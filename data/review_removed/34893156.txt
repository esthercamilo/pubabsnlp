Genetic polymorphisms on the effectiveness or safety of breast cancer treatment: Clinical relevance and future perspectives.
Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent neoplasm and one of the main causes of death in women. The pharmacological treatment of BC consists of hormonal therapy, chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapy. The response to BC therapy is highly variable in clinical practice. This variability can be explained by the presence of genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics or immune response of patients. The abundant evidence of associations between low-activity alleles CYP2D6*3, *4, *5, *6, *10 and *41 and poor results with tamoxifen therapy, and between DPYD gene polymorphisms rs3918290, rs55886062, rs67376798 and rs75017182 and increased risk of toxicity to fluoropyrimidine therapy, justify the existence of clinical pharmacogenetic guidelines. The NQO1 rs1800566 polymorphism is related to poorer results in BC therapy with chemotherapy agents. The polymorphism rs1695 of the GSTP1 gene has been associated with the effectiveness and toxicity of fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and epirubicin therapy. Finally, the HLA-DQA1*02:01 allele is significantly associated with the occurrence of liver toxicity events in patients receiving lapatinib. There is moderate evidence to support the aforementioned associations and, therefore, a high probability of these being considered as future predictive genetic biomarkers of response. However, further studies are required to reinforce or clarify their clinical relevance.
