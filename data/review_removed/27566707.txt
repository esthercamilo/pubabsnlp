Practical Pharmacogenomic Approaches to Heart Failure Therapeutics.
The major challenge in applying pharmacogenomics to everyday clinical practice in heart failure (HF) is based on (1) a lack of robust clinical evidence for the differential utilization of neurohormonal antagonists in the management of HF in different subgroups, (2) inconsistent results regarding appropriate subgroups that may potentially benefit from an alternative strategy based on pharmacogenomic analyses, and (3) a lack of clinical trials that focused on testing gene-guided treatment in HF. To date, all pharmacogenomic analyses in HF have been conducted as post hoc retrospective analyses of clinical trial data or of observational patient series studies. This is in direct contrast with the guideline-directed HF therapies that have demonstrated their safety and efficacy in the absence of pharmacogenomic guidance. Therefore, the future of clinical applications of pharmacogenomic testing will largely depend on our ability to incorporate gene-drug interactions into the prescribing process, requiring that preemptive and cost-effective testing be paired with decision-support tools in a value-based care approach.
