Economic Evaluation of Multiple-Pharmacogenes Testing for the Prevention of Adverse Drug Reactions in People Living with HIV.
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) testing is one of the methods for determining whether individuals are at risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). It has been reported that multiple-PGx testing, a sequencing technology, has a higher predictive value than single-PGx testing. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the most cost-effective PGx testing strategies for preventing drug-induced serious ADRs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients.
