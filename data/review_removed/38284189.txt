Association between several immune response-related genes and the effectiveness of biological treatments in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
Biological therapies are safer and more effective against psoriasis than conventional treatments. Even so, 30-50% of psoriatic patients show an inadequate response, which is associated with individual genetic heterogeneity. Pharmacogenetic studies have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as possible predictive and prognostic biomarkers for psoriasis treatment response. The objective of this study was to determine the link between several SNPs and the clinical response to biological therapies in patients with moderate-severe psoriasis. A set of 21 SNPs related to psoriasis and/or other immunological diseases were selected and analysed from salivary samples of patients (n = 88). Treatment effectiveness and patient improvement was assessed clinically through Relative Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), also called 'PASI response', as well as absolute PASI. Associations between SNPs and PASI factors were assessed at 3 and 12 months for every treatment category of IL-17, IL-23, IL-12&23 and TNF-α inhibitors. Multivariate correlation analysis and Fisher's exact test were used to analyse the relationship between SNPs and therapy outcomes. Several SNPs located in the TLR2, TLR5, TIRAP, HLA-C, IL12B, SLC12A8, TNFAIP3 and PGLYRP4 genes demonstrated association with increased short and long-term therapy-effectiveness rates. Most patients achieved values of PASI response ≥75 or absolute PASI<1, regardless of the biological treatment administered. In conclusion, we demonstrate a relationship between different SNPs and both short- and especially long-term effectiveness of biological treatment in terms of PASI. These polymorphisms may be used as predictive markers of treatment response in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, providing personalized treatment.
