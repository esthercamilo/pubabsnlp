Contribution of allelic variations to the phenotype of response to antidepressants and antipsychotics.
Individualized medicine through molecular pharmacogenetics is one of the major future goals in clinical medicine. In psychopharmacology, pharmacogenetics became an expanding research component. Major research results were already attained: first, it is now feasible to predict a major proportion of the interindividual variation of plasma levels of most antidepressants and antipsychotics by using the DNA-sequence variation in genes for crucial CYP P450-enzymes as CYP2D6. Second, it is now possible to relate serious side effects (tardive dyskinesia, weight gain) of antipsychotics to specific genetic variants of genes for target proteins. Third, a long list of mainly functional variants in target protein genes was explored for their predictive power for the beneficial and adverse treatment outcome. Although specific results transferable into clinical practice were not yet obtained in this respect, the proof of principle could be demonstrated.
