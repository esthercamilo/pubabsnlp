Nurses should be up to speed on pharmacogenetic testing.
The expectations for pharmacogenetic testing have been high, partly because of the hype surrounding the human genome project (art & science January 28). But pharmacogenetics will soon become a reality in everyday health care in the UK.

However, it will be helpful in preventing harm when there are difficulties in finding the specific therapeutic dose for a patient.
