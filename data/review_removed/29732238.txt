Pharmacometabolomic signature links simvastatin therapy and insulin resistance.
Statins, widely prescribed drugs for treatment of cardiovascular disease, inhibit the biosynthesis of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Despite providing major benefits, sub populations of patients experience adverse effects, including muscle myopathy and development of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that may result in premature discontinuation of treatment. There are no reliable biomarkers for predicting clinical side effects in vulnerable individuals. Pharmacometabolomics provides powerful tools for identifying global biochemical changes induced by statin treatment, providing insights about drug mechanism of action, development of side effects and basis of variation of response.
