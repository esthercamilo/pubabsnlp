Extremely low warfarin dose in patients with genotypes of CYP2C9*3/*3 and VKORC1-1639A/A.
Patients with the genotypes of both CYP2C9*3/*3 and VKORC1-1639 A/A are expected to require the lowest dose of warfarin, and to have a greatly increased risk of bleeding. The experience for the dosing of warfarin in such extremely rare cases has been seldom reported.
