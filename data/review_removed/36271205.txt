Microdialysis of Voriconazole and its N-Oxide Metabolite: Amalgamating Knowledge of Distribution and Metabolism Processes in Humans.
Voriconazole is an essential antifungal drug whose complex pharmacokinetics with high interindividual variability impedes effective and safe therapy. By application of the minimally-invasive sampling technique microdialysis, interstitial space fluid (ISF) concentrations of VRC and its potentially toxic N-oxide metabolite (NO) were assessed to evaluate target-site exposure for further elucidating VRC pharmacokinetics.
