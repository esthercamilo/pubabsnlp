Pharmacogenetics-based area-under-curve model can predict efficacy and adverse events from axitinib in individual patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.
We investigated the relationship between axitinib pharmacogenetics and clinical efficacy/adverse events in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and established a model to predict clinical efficacy and adverse events using pharmacokinetic and gene polymorphisms related to drug metabolism and efflux in a phase II trial. We prospectively evaluated the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of axitinib, objective response rate, and adverse events in 44 consecutive advanced RCC patients treated with axitinib. To establish a model for predicting clinical efficacy and adverse events, polymorphisms in genes including ABC transporters (<i>ABCB1</i> and <i>ABCG2</i>), <i>UGT1A</i>, and <i>OR2B11</i> were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing, Sanger sequencing, and DNA microarray. To validate this prediction model, calculated AUC by 6 gene polymorphisms was compared with actual AUC in 16 additional consecutive patients prospectively. Actual AUC significantly correlated with the objective response rate (<i>P</i> = 0.0002) and adverse events (hand-foot syndrome, <i>P</i> = 0.0055; and hypothyroidism, <i>P</i> = 0.0381). Calculated AUC significantly correlated with actual AUC (<i>P</i> < 0.0001), and correctly predicted objective response rate (<i>P</i> = 0.0044) as well as adverse events (<i>P</i> = 0.0191 and 0.0082, respectively). In the validation study, calculated AUC prior to axitinib treatment precisely predicted actual AUC after axitinib treatment (<i>P</i> = 0.0066). Our pharmacogenetics-based AUC prediction model may determine the optimal initial dose of axitinib, and thus facilitate better treatment of patients with advanced RCC.
