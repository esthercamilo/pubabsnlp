LA-GEM: imputation of gene expression with incorporation of Local Ancestry.
Gene imputation and TWAS have become a staple in the genomics medicine discovery space; helping to identify genes whose regulation effects may contribute to disease susceptibility. However, the cohorts on which these methods are built are overwhelmingly of European Ancestry. This means that the unique regulatory variation that exist in non-European populations, specifically African Ancestry populations, may not be included in the current models. Moreover, African Americans are an admixed population, with a mix of European and African segments within their genome. No gene imputation model thus far has incorporated the effect of local ancestry (LA) on gene expression imputation. As such, we created LA-GEM which was trained and tested on a cohort of 60 African American hepatocyte primary cultures. Uniquely, LA-GEM include local ancestry inference in its prediction of gene expression. We compared the performance of LA-GEM to PrediXcan trained the same dataset (with no inclusion of local ancestry) We were able to reliably predict the expression of 2559 genes (1326 in LA-GEM and 1236 in PrediXcan). Of these, 546 genes were unique to LA-GEM, including the CYP3A5 gene which is critical to drug metabolism. We conducted TWAS analysis on two African American clinical cohorts with pharmacogenomics phenotypic information to identity novel gene associations. In our IWPC warfarin cohort, we identified 17 transcriptome-wide significant hits. No gene reached are prespecified significance level in the clopidogrel cohort. We did see suggestive association with RAS3A to P2RY12 Reactivity Units (PRU), a clinical measure of response to anti-platelet therapy. This method demonstrated the need for the incorporation of LA into study in admixed populations.
