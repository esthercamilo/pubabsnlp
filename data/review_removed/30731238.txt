High voriconazole target-site exposure after approved sequence dosing due to nonlinear pharmacokinetics assessed by long-term microdialysis.
Voriconazole, a broad-spectrum antifungal drug used to prevent and treat invasive fungal infections, shows complex pharmacokinetics and is primarily metabolised by various CYP enzymes. An adequate unbound antibiotic concentration-time profile at the target-site of an infection is crucial for effective prophylaxis or therapy success. Therefore, the aim was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of voriconazole after the approved sequence dosing in healthy volunteers in interstitial space fluid, assessed by microdialysis, and in plasma. Moreover, potential pharmacogenetic influences of CYP2C19 polymorphisms on pharmacokinetics were investigated. The prospective, open-labelled, uncontrolled long-term microdialysis study included 9 healthy male individuals receiving the approved sequence dosing regimen for voriconazole. Unbound voriconazole concentrations were sampled over 84â€¯h in interstitial space fluid of subcutaneous adipose tissue and in plasma and subsequently quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography. For pharmacokinetic data analysis, non-compartmental analysis was used. High interindividual variability in voriconazole concentration-time profiles was detected although dosing was adapted to body weight for the first intravenous administrations. Due to nonlinear pharmacokinetics, target-site exposure of voriconazole in healthy volunteers was found to be highly comparable to plasma exposure, particularly after multiple dosing. Regarding the CYP2C19 genotype-predicted phenotype, the individuals revealed a broad spectrum, ranging from poor to rapid metaboliser status. A strong relation between CYP2C19 genotype-predicted phenotype and voriconazole clearance was identified.
