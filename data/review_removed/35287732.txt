Examining key factors impact on health science students' intentions to adopt genetic and pharmacogenomics testing: a comparative path analysis in two different healthcare settings.
There is an increasing interest worldwide in investigating healthcare stakeholders' perceptions and intentions to adopt pharmacogenomics (PGx) into clinical practice. However, the existing inquiries based on well-established theories and models that interpret their intentions to implement PGx are scarce. This study is the first that examines the impact of selected factors on health science students' intention to adopt genetic testing applications using the technology acceptance model while it compares two different cultural groups: Greeks (Europe; Christian) and Malays (Asia; Muslim).
