Genetic polymorphisms and their association with methotrexate polyglutamates during maintenance treatment in Korean children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of genetic polymorphisms on methotrexate (MTX) metabolism in Korean children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, specifically focusing on MTX polyglutamates (MTX-PGs) in erythrocytes, which have been rarely studied. Korean children and young adult patients undergoing maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who were receiving weekly oral MTX doses of 20 mg/mÂ²/week, were prospectively included. We investigated erythrocyte MTX-PG (PG1 to PG5) levels, MTX-PG/MTX dose ratios, and 222 genetic polymorphisms spanning 78 genes and three intergenic areas related to MTX transport, folate cycle metabolism, purine/pyrimidine pathways, and non-pathway genes (including TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes) to explore their association with MTX metabolism. MTX-PG levels were associated with MTX dose (p < 0.05), and MTX-PG3 comprised the majority of the total MTX-PGs, with a median of 39.3 %. Various polymorphisms within the same gene demonstrated differing associations with each type of MTX-PG, underscoring the complexity of MTX pharmacogenetics. Among the polymorphisms examined, 14 across 13 genes showed significant associations with MTX-PG2-5 levels, even after adjusting for the false discovery rate (ABCC5, ATG16L1, CEP72, FSTL5, GMPS, HTR3A, IMPDH1, NT5C2, SLC28A3, SLCO1B3, SUCLA2, TPMT, and TYMS). This study enhances our understanding of genetic polymorphisms in MTX metabolism and therapeutic monitoring for MTX maintenance, promoting personalized medicine in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.
