Pharmacogenetic allele variant frequencies: An analysis of the VA's Million Veteran Program (MVP) as a representation of the diversity in US population.
We present allele frequencies of pharmacogenomics relevant variants across multiple ancestry in a sample representative of the US population. We analyzed 658,582 individuals with genotype data and extracted pharmacogenomics relevant single nucleotide variant (SNV) alleles, human leukocyte antigens (HLA) 4-digit alleles and an important copy number variant (CNV), the full deletion/duplication of CYP2D6. We compiled distinct allele frequency tables for European, African American, Hispanic, and Asian ancestry individuals. In addition, we compiled allele frequencies based on local ancestry reconstruction in the African-American (2-way deconvolution) and Hispanic (3-way deconvolution) cohorts.
