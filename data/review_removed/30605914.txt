A Pharmacogenomics Clinical Decision Support Service Based on FHIR and CDS Hooks.
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is often considered a low-hanging fruit for genomics-electronic health record (EHR) integrations, and many have expressed the notion that drug-gene interaction checking might one day become as much a commodity in EHRs as drug-drug and drug-allergy checking. In addition, the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator has recognized the trend toward storing complete sequencing data outside the EHR in a Genomic Archiving and Communication System (GACS) and has emphasized the need for "pilots that test Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Genomics for GACS integration with EHRs." We sought to develop a PGx clinical decision support (CDS) service, leveraging the emerging FHIR and CDS Hooks standards, and based on an assumption that pharmacogene sequencing data would be stored alongside the EHR in a GACS.
