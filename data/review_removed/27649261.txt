MiR-pharmacogenetics of methotrexate in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Methotrexate (MTX), the key drug in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) therapy, often causes toxicity. An association between genetic variants in MTX transport genes and toxicity has been found. It is known that these transporters are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs), and miRNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) interfere with miRNA levels or function. With regard to B-cell ALL, we have previously found rs56103835 in miR-323b that targets ABCC4 associated with MTX plasma levels. Despite these evidences and that nowadays a large amount of new miRNAs have been annotated, studies of miRNA polymorphisms and MTX toxicity are almost absent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether there are other variants in miRNAs associated with MTX levels.
