CASTER: Cross-Sectional Asthma STEroid Response Measurement.
Asthma patient response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is variable and difficult to quantify. We aimed to define a measure of steroid response suitable for pharmacogenetic research in longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts. Using longitudinal data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) asthma cohort, we defined the Cross-sectional Asthma STEroid Response (CASTER) measure in cross-sectional data. We then applied this to cross-sectional slices of four independent asthma cohorts: The Improving Asthma Control Trial (IMPACT), the Salmeterol or Corticosteroids Study (SOCS), the Pediatric Asthma Controller Trial (PACT), and the Genetics of Asthma in Costa Rica Study (GACRS). CASTER achieved high accuracy on the childhood asthma cohorts: GACRS, PACT, and also on cross-sectional data from CAMP (AUCs 82%, 71%, 63%, respectively). This demonstrates that select cross-sectional clinical information is sufficient to identify good and poor responders to ICS treatment in childhood asthma. Thus, CASTER represents a major improvement in the usability and applicability of steroid response measures in asthma research.
