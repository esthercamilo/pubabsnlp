A pharmacogenetics study of platinum-based chemotherapy in lung cancer: <i>ABCG2</i> polymorphism and its genetic interaction with <i>SLC31A1</i> are associated with response and survival.
<b>Objective:</b> The expression and function of platinum transporters affect drug tissue concentration and therapeutic effects. We had previously characterized functional variant of platinum intake transporter <i>SLC31A1</i> gene. We aimed to investigate the association of platinum efflux transporter gene <i>ABCG2</i> polymorphism and combined <i>ABCG2</i> and <i>SLC31A1</i> polymorphisms with clinical outcomes of NSCLC patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. <b>Methods:</b> We genotyped thirteen tagging and functional SNPs of <i>ABCG2</i> in 1004 patients, and assessed their association with response, toxicity and survival using unconditional logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses respectively. <b>Results:</b> Nonsynonymous rs2231142 (odds ratio [OR] 2.07; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.26-3.63), rs1871744 (OR 0.60; 95 % CI 0.42-0.87) and their haplotype and diplotype were associated with objective response. Rs4148157 was associated with shorter overall survival (Log-rank <i>P</i> = 0.002; hazard ratio [HR] 1.22; 95 % CI 1.05-1.42). Furthermore, the combined <i>SLC31A1</i> rs2233914 and <i>ABCG2</i> rs1871744 genotype was significantly associated with poor response (OR 0.31; 95 % CI 0.17-0.56; <i>P</i> <sub>interaction</sub> = 0.003). And the combined genotypes of the functional rs10759637 of <i>SLC31A1</i> and the nonsynonymous rs2231142 (Log-rank <i>P</i> = 5.20Ã—10<sup>-5</sup>; HR 1.47; 95 % CI 1.19-1.81; <i>P</i> <sub>interaction</sub> = 0.007) or linked rs4148157 of <i>ABCG2</i> were significantly associated with poor survival. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study reveals divergent association of <i>ABCG2</i> polymorphism with response and survival of NSCLC patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy, demonstrates the combined effects of functional variants of <i>ABCG2</i> and <i>SLC31A1</i> on clinical outcomes, and highlights pharmacogenetic relevance of platinum transporter genes interaction.
