Chaihu-Shugan-San Reinforces CYP3A4 Expression via Pregnane X Receptor in Depressive Treatment of Liver-Qi Stagnation Syndrome.
<i>Background</i>s. Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS) is a classic traditional Chinese herbal prescription for treating depression. However, the underlying mechanism of the Chinese syndrome-specific efficacy of CSS is poorly understood. <i>Aim of the Study</i>. From traditional Chinese medicine and pharmacogenetics perspectives, the present study aimed to investigate the antidepressant effects of CSS on a mouse model of Liver-Qi Stagnation (LQS) syndrome and its underlying mechanisms. <i>Methods and Materials</i>. We used two main mouse models of depressive syndromes in the study, including LQS and liver stagnation and spleen deficiency (LSSD) syndrome. Tail suspension and forced swimming tests were used to evaluate the effects of CSS on animal behaviour. The expression level of the CYP450 enzyme from liver microsomes was analysed by western blot (WB) analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). More specifically, we analysed the key compounds of CSS that are responsible for CYP450 regulation via bioinformatics. Ultimately, luciferase assays were employed to confirm the prediction <i>in vitro</i>. <i>Results</i>. CSS remarkably reduced the immobile time in LQS rather than in LSSD mice. Although CSS significantly upregulated CYP2C9 in mice with both syndromes, activated translation of CYP3A4 induced by CSS was only observed in the LQS group. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the unique regulation of CYP3A4 was responsible for the effects of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) from CSS. Further luciferase assays confirmed the enhancement of CYP3A4 expression via the pregnane X receptor (PXR) pathway <i>in vitro</i>. <i>Conclusions</i>. CSS specifically upregulates the translation of CYP3A4 via the PXR pathway in depressed LQS mice. GA, a bioactive compound that originates from CSS, contributes to this activation. This work provides novel insight into Chinese syndrome-based therapy for depression.
