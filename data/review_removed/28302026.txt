Drug Metabolism in Preclinical Drug Development: A Survey of the Discovery Process, Toxicology, and Computational Tools.
While establishing efficacy in translational models and humans through clinically-relevant endpoints for disease is of great interest, assessing the potential toxicity of a putative therapeutic drug is critical. Toxicological assessments in the pre-clinical discovery phase help to avoid future failure in the clinical phases of drug development. Many in vitro assays exist to aid in modular toxicological assessment, such as hepatotoxicity and genotoxicity. While these methods have provided tremendous insight into human toxicity by investigational new drugs, they are expensive, require substantial resources, and do not account for pharmacogenomics as well as critical ADME properties. Computational tools can fill this niche in toxicology if in silico models are accurate in relating drug molecular properties to toxicological endpoints as well as reliable in predicting important drug-target interactions that mediate known adverse events or adverse outcome pathways (AOPs).
