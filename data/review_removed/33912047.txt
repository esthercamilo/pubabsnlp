A New Insight for the Identification of Oncogenic Variants in Breast and Prostate Cancers in Diverse Human Populations, With a Focus on Latinos.
<b>Background:</b> Breast cancer (BRCA) and prostate cancer (PRCA) are the most commonly diagnosed cancer types in Latin American women and men, respectively. Although in recent years large-scale efforts from international consortia have focused on improving precision oncology, a better understanding of genomic features of BRCA and PRCA in developing regions and racial/ethnic minority populations is still required. <b>Methods:</b> To fill in this gap, we performed integrated <i>in silico</i> analyses to elucidate oncogenic variants from BRCA and PRCA driver genes; to calculate their deleteriousness scores and allele frequencies from seven human populations worldwide, including Latinos; and to propose the most effective therapeutic strategies based on precision oncology. <b>Results:</b> We analyzed 339,100 variants belonging to 99 BRCA and 82 PRCA driver genes and identified 18,512 and 15,648 known/predicted oncogenic variants, respectively. Regarding known oncogenic variants, we prioritized the most frequent and deleterious variants of BRCA (<i>n</i> = 230) and PRCA (<i>n</i> = 167) from Latino, African, Ashkenazi Jewish, East Asian, South Asian, European Finnish, and European non-Finnish populations, to incorporate them into pharmacogenomics testing. Lastly, we identified which oncogenic variants may shape the response to anti-cancer therapies, detailing the current status of pharmacogenomics guidelines and clinical trials involved in BRCA and PRCA cancer driver proteins. <b>Conclusion:</b> It is imperative to unify efforts where developing countries might invest in obtaining databases of genomic profiles of their populations, and developed countries might incorporate racial/ethnic minority populations in future clinical trials and cancer researches with the overall objective of fomenting pharmacogenomics in clinical practice and public health policies.
