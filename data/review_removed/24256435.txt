Evaluation of the pharmacogenetics of immune recovery in treated HIV-infected patients.
Combination antiretroviral therapy has markedly improved the survival rate and quality of life in patients infected with HIV due to the powerful suppressor effect that current antiretroviral drugs have on the viral load. Consequently, the immune system undergoes a substantial qualitative and quantitative improvement; and this leads to an increase in the absolute CD4(+) T-lymphocyte count and the restoration of lost T-cell responses against certain opportunistic pathogens. Unfortunately, not all patients who successfully suppress plasma viremia experience sufficient CD4(+) T-cell gain and these patients, in turn, are associated with worse outcomes. Pharmacogenetic studies have been used to investigate how a patient's genetic predisposition may affect their response to antiretroviral drugs.
