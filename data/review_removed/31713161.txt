Pharmaco-Geno-Proteo-Metabolomics and Translational Research in Cancer.
The diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cancer has had a great improvement due to the "omics" technologies such as genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, pharmacogenomics, and metabolomics. The technological progress of these technologies has allowed precision medicine to become a clinical reality. The study of different biomolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins has helped to detect alterations in genes, changes in gene expression profiles and loss or gain of protein function, which allows us to make associations and better understand the cancer biology. Data obtained from different "omics" technologies gives a complementary spectrum of information that helps us to understand and unveil new information for a better diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of new molecular targets of anticancer therapies, etc. This chapter presents a general landscape of the interaction between the Pharmaco-Geno-Proteo-Metabolomic and translational medicine research in cancer.
