Pharmacogenomics-guided supportive oncology: A tale of two trials.
Cancer-related symptoms, like depression, nausea, and pain, are common and negatively affect quality of life. Unfortunately, there is large inter-individual variability in response to supportive care medications for these symptoms. Pharmacogenomics may inform prescribing by identification of those genetically at risk for drug related adverse events or therapeutic failure. While such information can be applied to many drugs, there are specific oncology populations that could greatly benefit from pharmacogenomics-guided supportive care management due to high symptom burden, including those receiving palliative medicine and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of, and lessons learned from, the development of two prospective pharmacogenomics-guided interventional trials ("Supportive Care PGx Trial" and "Transplant PGx Trial") across two different clinical settings at the Levine Cancer Institute: the Department of Supportive Oncology and the Transplant and Cellular Therapy section. Key considerations included the appropriate study design and endpoints (balancing study goals and resources), dissemination and application of individual pharmacogenetics results, technical details about assay development, and overall care coordination to minimize clinic disruption.
