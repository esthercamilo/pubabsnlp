Exploring pharmacogenetic variation in a Bulgarian psychiatric cohort.
Pharmacogenetics in psychiatry is currently gaining momentum. The efficiency of antipsychotic therapy is often limited by the lack of response and the presence of side effects. Pharmacogenetic variation is probably one of the causative factors for the observed interindividual differences in the response to and the side effects of antipsychotics, which could be addressed and whose negative effects could be avoided or mitigated.
