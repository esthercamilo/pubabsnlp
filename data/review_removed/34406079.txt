A <i>GRIN3A</i> polymorphism may be associated with glucocorticoid-induced symptomatic osteonecrosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
<b>Aim:</b> To evaluate the association between candidate genetic polymorphisms and glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis in Arab children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 189 children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia were genotyped for four SNPs with allele discrimination assays. The incidence and timing of radiologically confirmed symptomatic grade 4 osteonecrosis were classified based on the Ponte di Legno toxicity working group consensus definition. <b>Results:</b> Thirteen children developed grade 4 osteonecrosis (6.8%), of whom 12 received the intermediate/high-risk treatment protocol. <i>GRIN3A</i> variant allele carriers had to stop dexamethasone therapy earlier resulting in significantly shorter duration of dexamethasone treatment (mean [95% CI]: 75.17 [64.28-86.06] vs 85.90 [81.22-90.58] weeks; p = 0.054) and lower cumulative dose (mean [95% CI]: 1118.11 [954.94-1281.29] vs 1341.14 [1264.17-1418.11] mg/m<sup>2;</sup> p = 0.011). <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first pharmacogenomics evaluation of the association between <i>GRIN3A</i> variants and glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis in Arab children.
