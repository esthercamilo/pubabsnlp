PACdb: a database for cell-based pharmacogenomics.
We have developed Pharmacogenomics And Cell database (PACdb), a results database that makes available relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms, gene expression, and cellular sensitivity to various drugs in cell-based models to help determine genetic variants associated with drug response. The current version also supports summary analysis on differentially expressed genes between the HapMap samples of European and African ancestry, as well as queries for summary information of correlations between gene expression and pharmacological phenotypes. At present, data generated on the following anticancer agents are included: carboplatin, cisplatin, etoposide, daunorubicin, and cytarabine (Ara-C). The database is also available to assist in the investigation of the effects of potential confounding variables (e.g. cell proliferation rate) in lymphoblastoid cell lines. PACdb will be regularly updated to include more drugs and new datasets (e.g. baseline microRNA levels). PACdb will be linked into PharmGKB to benefit the next wave of pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic discovery.
