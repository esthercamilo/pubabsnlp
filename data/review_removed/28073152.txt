Characterizing Pharmacogenomic-Guided Medication Use With a Clinical Data Repository.
The extent to which pharmacogenomic-guided medication use has been adopted in various health systems is unclear. To assess the uptake of pharmacogenomic-guided medication use, we determined its frequency across our health system, which does not have a structured testing program. Using a multisite clinical data repository, we identified adult patients' first prescribed medications between January 2011 and December 2013 and investigated the frequency of germline and somatic pharmacogenomic testing, by the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase level of the US Food and Drug Administration label information. There were 268,262 medication orders for drugs with germline pharmacogenomic testing information in their drug labels. Pharmacogenomic testing was detected for 1.5% (129/8,718) of medication orders with recommended or required testing. Of the 3,817 medication orders associated with somatic pharmacogenomic testing information in their drug labels, 20% (372/1,819) of required tests were detected. The low rates of detectable pharmacogenomic testing suggest that structured testing programs are required to achieve the success of precision medicine.
