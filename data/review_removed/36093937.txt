A survey of physician opinions in Russia in the field of pharmacogenetics of cardiovascular disease.
<b>Aims:</b> To study the readiness of Russian physicians with experience and younger physicians undergoing clinical residency and postgraduate education to apply pharmacogenetic testing in their clinical practice. <b>Materials & methods:</b> The sociological study involved physicians (n = 378) living in different regions of the Russian Federation, as well as residents and graduate students (n = 185) of the Russian Medical Academy of Continuing Professional Medical Education. The survey consisted of 35 questions, and 23 were created on the online platform of professional surveys, Testograf.ru. <b>Results:</b> Every second respondent was willing to use pharmacogenetic testing in clinical practice to predict the efficacy and safety of medications in patients with cardiovascular disease (p = 0.06). Factors impeding the clinical implementation of pharmacogenetic testing in Russia were identified: physicians' ignorance of pharmacogenetics (p = 0.015), a lack of pharmacogenetic testing in clinical guidelines and treatment standards (p = 0.175) and a lack of economic justification for using pharmacogenetic testing (p = 0.320). <b>Conclusion:</b> Russian physicians have a positive attitude toward pharmacogenetic testing. However, the level of test implementation remains low.
