Efficacy and mechanisms of cannabis oil for alleviating side effects of breast cancer chemotherapy (CBC2): protocol for randomized controlled trial.
In a pilot study using both cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as single agents in advanced cancer patients undergoing palliative care in Thailand, the doses were generally well tolerated, and the outcome measure of total symptom distress scores showed overall symptom benefit. The current study aims to determine the intensity of the symptoms experienced by breast cancer patients, to explore the microbiome profile, cytokines, and bacterial metabolites before and after the treatment with cannabis oil or no cannabis oil, and to study the pharmacokinetics parameters and pharmacogenetics profile of the doses.
