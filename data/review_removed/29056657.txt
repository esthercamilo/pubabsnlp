Updates on Oxaliplatin-Induced Peripheral Neurotoxicity (OXAIPN).
Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXAIPN) is of great clinical interest as it ranks among the most common dose limiting toxicities of oxaliplatin (OXA) administration with an obvious impact on the outcome of cancer patients. In addition, OXAIPN has a detrimental effect on the quality of life of cancer patients because it can be long lasting or even permanent. It has a unique spectrum of clinical presentation, being manifested with two distinct syndromes: the acute neurotoxicity that appears soon after OXA administration and is usually transient, and the chronic cumulative syndrome that resembles the characteristics of all platinum compounds. Despite advances in research in relation to the elucidation of the true OXAIPN pathogenesis, characteristics and management, there are still several open issues to be addressed. One of the most important open issues is to determine reliable biomarkers to allow prompt identification of patients at high risk to develop OXAIPN and towards this view well designed genome wide analyses are warranted to adequately address this gap in knowledge. Recent updates are provided in this article in relation to the pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, pharmacogenetics and management of OXAIPN.
