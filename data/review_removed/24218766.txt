[Potential and perspective of genetic testing in Renaissance of laboratory medicine].
Among molecular genetic tests, tests for genomic biomarkers are increasingly performed in order to decide the right drug for the right patient at the right time. These genetic tests, including pharmacogenomics (PGx) tests, are essential for personalized medicine. Companion diagnostics (CDx) will be co-developed from the early stage of drug development and used for patient stratification in Phases II/III of clinical trials. The strategic change in development from blockbuster drugs to molecularly targeted drugs will enhance the clinical application of genetic tests, including CDx and PGx. The genetic tests utilized for making treatment decisions have the potential to regenerate laboratory medicine.
