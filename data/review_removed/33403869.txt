Veterans Affairs Pharmacogenomic Testing for Veterans (PHASER) clinical program.
In 2019, the Veterans Affairs (VA), the largest integrated US healthcare system, started the Pharmacogenomic Testing for Veterans (PHASER) clinical program that provides multi-gene pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing for up to 250,000 veterans at approximately 50 sites. PHASER is staggering program initiation at sites over a 5-year period from 2019 to 2023, as opposed to simultaneous initiation at all sites, to facilitate iterative program quality improvements through Plan-Do-Study-ActÂ cycles. Current resources in the PGx field have not focused on multisite, remote implementation of panel-based PGx testing. In addition to bringing large scale PGx testing to veterans, the PHASER program is developing a roadmap to maximize uptake and optimize the use of PGx to improve drug response outcomes.
