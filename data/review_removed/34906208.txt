Pharmacist-guided pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing in antidepressant therapy (PrePGx): study protocol for an open-label, randomized controlled trial.
It is known that only 50% of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorders (MDD) respond to the first-line antidepressant treatment. Accordingly, there is a need to improve response rates to reduce healthcare costs and patient suffering. One approach to increase rates of treatment response might be the integration of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing to stratify antidepressant drug selection. The goal of PGx assessments is to identify patients who have an increased risk to experience adverse drug reactions or non-response to specific drugs. Especially for antidepressants, there is compiling evidence on PGx influencing drug exposure as well as response.
