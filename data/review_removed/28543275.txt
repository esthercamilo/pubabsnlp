The role of ITPA and ribavirin transporter genes polymorphisms in prediction of ribavirin-induced anaemia in chronic hepatitis C Egyptian patients.
Few data are available concerning the roles of polymorphisms of inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) gene and ribavirin (RBV) transporter genes in the prediction of RBV-induced anaemia among Egyptians with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Genotyping of three ITPA gene variants and two variants of RBV transporter genes has been performed in 123 patients under pegylated interferon-α/ribavirin treatment. The baseline haemoglobin and ITPA rs1127354 CA/AA have been found as predictors of anaemia at 4, 8 and 12 weeks of RBV therapy. In addition, ITPA rs7270101 AC/CC and age predicted anaemia after 12 weeks of therapy. In conclusion, the ITPA variant rs1127354C>A significantly predict RBV-induced anaemia during the first 3 months of treatment and it is recommended to be assessed before RBV administration.
