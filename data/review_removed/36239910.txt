Direct-to-consumer genetic testing in the news: a descriptive analysis.
Direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC GT) diagnostic tools do not entail referral through a healthcare provider and are used by consumers to screen for genetic health risk, pharmacogenomics, and predisposition to certain diseases and to learn more about ancestry. The purpose of this study was to describe the content of DTC DNA online news articles - specifically to characterize how rising concerns related to consumer privacy, medical advancements, and bioethics are covered in online news as access to these testing kits continues to grow. One hundred news articles identified on Google News using the search term "direct to consumer DNA testing" were coded for pre-determined content categories. Only 34.0% of news articles were created by healthcare professionals. Only 10.0% of online news articles mentioned testing confidentiality and privacy protection. Articles that mentioned > 5 commercial DTC DNA products more often discussed how DTC DNA testing provides personalized information about health and link to family disease risk and other traits (85.7% vs. 61.1%, p = 0.02), can lead to the location of family members or ancestors (78.6% vs. 55.63%, p = 0.03), and that the testing results housed in DNA databases can be utilized by law enforcement to track suspects or their relatives (32.1% vs. 9.7%, p = 0.01). Articles that mentioned ≤ 5 commercial DTC DNA products failed to mention that there exists a potential for data breaches (75.0% vs. 53.6%, p = 0.04). Online news articles should adequately inform consumers regarding the benefits and risks of DTC GT tests to facilitate informed decision-making.
