<i>CYP</i> Genotypes Are Associated with Toxicity and Survival in Osteosarcoma Patients.
<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Osteosarcoma is the malignant bone tumor most common in children and adolescents. Many cytochrome P-450 (CYP) members detoxify anticancer drugs used in osteosarcoma treatment, and thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate <i>CYP</i> polymorphisms in osteosarcoma patients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The present study investigated DNA from peripheral blood from 70 osteosarcoma patients treated with high doses of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and methotrexate. <i>CYP1A2*1F</i> (163C>A; rs762551); <i>CYP2C9*3</i> (1075A>C; rs1057910); and <i>CYP3A5*3</i> (6986A>G; rs776746) polymorphisms were investigated through real-time PCR using TaqMan probes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The <i>CYP2C9*3</i> allele did not present any association with clinical events. The <i>CYP1A2</i> CC/AC genotypes were associated with ototoxicity occurrence (<i>p</i> = 0.041, odds ratio [OR] = 8.4) and high grades of ototoxicity (<i>p</i> = 0.039, OR = 10.7), when compared with patients carrying the <i>CYP1A2</i> AA genotype. The <i>CYP1A2</i> CC genotype was associated with high grades of diarrhea (<i>p</i> = 0.043, OR = 4.6) and fever (<i>p</i> = 0.041, OR = 7.1) in comparison with the <i>CYP1A2</i> AA/AC genotypes. The <i>CYP3A5</i> CC genotype was associated with weight loss (<i>p</i> = 0.009, OR = 3.8) and high grades of hepatotoxicity (<i>p</i> = 0.010, OR = 4.3) when compared with the <i>CYP3A5</i> TT/CT genotypes. The <i>CYP3A5</i> CC/CT genotypes were associated with high grades of vomit (<i>p</i> = 0.013, OR = 10.8), pulmonary relapse absence (<i>p</i> = 0.029, OR = 9.5), and better overall and event-free survivals (<i>p</i> = 0.017, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.1; <i>p</i> = 0.044, HR = 2.5; respectively) when compared with the <i>CYP3A5</i> AA genotype. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b><i>CYP1A2*1A</i> and <i>CYP3A5*3</i> alleles were associated with toxicity events. <i>CYP3A5*3</i> allele was associated with better survival. Thus, <i>CYP</i> genotypes might be promising markers to tailoring treatment in osteosarcoma patients.
