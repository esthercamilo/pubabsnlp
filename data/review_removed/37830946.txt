Pharmacogenetics to prevent hypersensitivity reactions to antiepileptic drugs: is testing performed when indicated?
Extensive scientific evidence consistently demonstrates the clinical validity and utility of HLA-B*15:02 pre-screening in averting severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), namely Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, associated with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine usage. Current practice guidelines and drug labeling actively advocate for pharmacogenetic pre-screening before initiating these antiepileptic drugs (AED), with particular emphasis on patients of Asian descent. However, there is a potential need to strengthen compliance with these recommendations. This retrospective study aimed to describe the pharmacogenetic pre-screening, documentation, and SCARs incidence for patients of Asian ancestry initiated on carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine at a large Northeastern USA healthcare system. Between 1 July 2016 and August 1, 2021, 27 patients with documented Asian heritage in the electronic health record (EHR) were included. The overall rate of HLA-B*15:02 pre-screening before carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine initiation was 4%. None who underwent pharmacogenetic pre-screening carried the associated HLA-B risk allele, and no SCARs were reported. Notably, pharmacogenetic results were not discretely entered into the EHR, and the results were only found as attached documents in the miscellaneous section of the EHR. There remains a significant opportunity for improving HLA-B*15:02 pre-screening for patients starting carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine to prevent SCARs in the USA.
