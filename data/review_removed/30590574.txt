Pharmacogenomic clinical decision support design and multi-site process outcomes analysis in the eMERGE Network.
To better understand the real-world effects of pharmacogenomic (PGx) alerts, this study aimed to characterize alert design within the eMERGE Network, and to establish a method for sharing PGx alert response data for aggregate analysis. Seven eMERGE sites submitted design details and established an alert logging data dictionary. Six sites participated in a pilot study, sharing alert response data from their electronic health record systems. PGx alert design varied, with some consensus around the use of active, post-test alerts to convey Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommendations. Sites successfully shared response data, with wide variation in acceptance and follow rates. Results reflect the lack of standardization in PGx alert design. Standards and/or larger studies will be necessary to fully understand PGx impact. This study demonstrated a method for sharing PGx alert response data and established that variation in system design is a significant barrier for multi-site analyses.
