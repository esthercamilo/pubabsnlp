Personalising Social Ills: An Analysis of Race-based Genomics and Personalised Medicine.
The mapping and sequencing of the human genome at the turn of the new millennium marks a pivotal reassessment of genomic science in its potential to replace traditional "one-size-fits-all" medicine with a personalised approach. The use of racial proxies in the development of pharmacogenomic products risks conflating genetics with race under the guise of alleviating health disparities. This article argues that the current genomic approaches to realising personalised medicine do not deliver on the promise for optimised health for all and may result in irreversible harm, including psychological, social and medical harm, to racial minority groups. In light of recent epigenetic findings, the article provides a reconceptualisation of the genome and race, which is necessary to understand enduring racial disparities and the cumulative effects of racial discrimination. It then addresses the need for regulatory oversight of the approval of race-based pharmacogenomic products.
