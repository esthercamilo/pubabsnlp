The FKBP5 polymorphism rs1360780 influences the effect of an algorithm-based antidepressant treatment and is associated with remission in patients with major depression.
The FKBP5-gene influences the HPA-system by modulating the sensitivity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The polymorphism rs1360780 has been associated with response in studies with heterogeneous antidepressant treatment. In contrast, several antidepressant studies with standardized antidepressant treatment could not detect this effect. We therefore compared patients with standardized vs naturalistic antidepressant treatment to (a) investigate a possible interaction between FKBP5-genotype and treatment mode and (b) replicate the effect of the FKBP5-genotype on antidepressant treatment outcome.
