Individualized Pharmacotherapy Utilizing Genetic Biomarkers and Novel In Vitro Systems As Predictive Tools for Optimal Drug Development and Treatment.
In the area of drug development and clinical pharmacotherapy, a profound understanding of the pharmacokinetics and potential adverse reactions associated with the drug under investigation is paramount. Essential to this endeavor is a comprehensive understanding about interindividual variations in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) genetics and the predictive capabilities of in vitro systems, shedding light on metabolite formation and the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Both the domains of pharmacogenomics and the advancement of in vitro systems are experiencing rapid expansion. Here we present an update on these burgeoning fields, providing an overview of their current status and illuminating potential future directions. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: There is very rapid development in the area of pharmacogenomics and in vitro systems for predicting drug pharmacokinetics and risk for adverse drug reactions. We provide an update of the current status of pharmacogenomics and developed in vitro systems on these aspects aimed to achieve a better personalized pharmacotherapy.
