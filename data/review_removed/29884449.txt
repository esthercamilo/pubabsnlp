Effectiveness of half-a-tablet efavirenz plus 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors as maintenance therapy with the guidance of therapeutic drug monitoring among virologically suppressed HIV-positive patients: A prospective study.
Optimal efavirenz (EFV) dose that minimizes adverse effects while maintaining efficacy has yet to be elucidated. With a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)-guided strategy, we assessed the effectiveness of half-a-tablet EFV plus 2 nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) in HIV-infected Taiwanese who had achieved viral suppression with full-dose (600Â mg) EFV.
