Copy Number Amplification of DNA Damage Repair Pathways Potentiates Therapeutic Resistance in Cancer.
<b>Rationale</b>: Loss of DNA damage repair (DDR) in the tumor is an established hallmark of sensitivity to DNA damaging agents such as chemotherapy. However, there has been scant investigation into gain-of-function alterations of DDR genes in cancer. This study aims to investigate to what extent copy number amplification of DDR genes occurs in cancer, and what are their impacts on tumor genome instability, patient prognosis and therapy outcome. <b>Methods</b>: Retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical, genomics, and pharmacogenomics data from 10,489 tumors, matched peripheral blood samples, and 1,005 cancer cell lines. The key discoveries were verified by an independent patient cohort and experimental validations. <b>Results</b>: This study revealed that 13 of the 80 core DDR genes were significantly amplified and overexpressed across the pan-cancer scale. Tumors harboring DDR gene amplification exhibited decreased global mutation load and mechanism-specific mutation signature scores, suggesting an increased DDR proficiency in the DDR amplified tumors. Clinically, patients with DDR gene amplification showed poor prognosis in multiple cancer types. The most frequent Nibrin (<i>NBN</i>) gene amplification in ovarian cancer tumors was observed in 15 out of 31 independent ovarian cancer patients. <i>NBN</i> overexpression in breast and ovarian cancer cells leads to BRCA1-dependent olaparib resistance by promoting the phosphorylation of ATM-S1981 and homology-dependent recombination efficiency. Finally, integration of the cancer pharmacogenomics database of 37 genome-instability targeting drugs across 505 cancer cell lines revealed significant correlations between DDR gene copy number amplification and DDR drug resistance, suggesting candidate targets for increasing patient treatment response. <b>Principal Conclusions</b>: DDR gene amplification can lead to chemotherapy resistance and poor overall survival by augmenting DDR. These amplified DDR genes may serve as actionable clinical biomarkers for cancer management.
