[Genetic and non-genetic factors of laboratory resistance to clopidogrel in patients with ischemic stroke].
To identify clinical and pharmacogenetic predictors of the efficacy of clopidogrel in patients with AI based on CYP2C19 and ABCB1 genotyping. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical and laboratory examinations were performed in 121 patients with AI, and CYP2C19 polymorphisms (CYP2C19*2 (G681A, rs4244285), CYP2C19*3 (G363A, rs4986893), CYP2C19*17 (C806T, rs12248560), ABCB1 (C3435T, rs1045642), associated with a disturbance of antiplatelet action of clopidogrel. The carriage of polymorphic markers of the studied genes was determined by the method of polymerase chain reaction in real time. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In the group with laboratory resistance to clopidogrel, women prevailed (p<0.0001), atherothrombotic subtype was 80% (p=0.0384), the frequency of obesity ischemic stroke was 60% (p<0.0001). Univariate analysis of variance of CYP2C19 polymorphisms CYP2C19 (CYP2C19*2 (G681A, rs4244285), CYP2C19*3 (G363A, rs4986893), CYP2C19*17 (C806T, rs12248560), ABCB1 (C3435T, rs1045642) in patients with ischemic stroke, demonstrated a significant effect of CYP2C19 genotypes on the indicators of residual reactivity of platelets.
