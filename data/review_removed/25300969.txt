Pharmacogenetics of etanercept: role of TNF-α gene polymorphisms in improving its efficacy.
During the last decade, many new biological immune modulators have entered the market as new therapeutic principles. Biologics, including TNF-α inhibitors, are the new frontier in the treatment of immune-mediated or inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic sclerosis, disseminated granuloma annulare, psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis. TNF-α inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy and are well tolerated in large, randomized, controlled clinical trials. However, a substantial proportion of patients do not respond to these agents and potential adverse drug reactions may be associated with its use.
