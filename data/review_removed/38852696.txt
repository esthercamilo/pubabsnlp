The Effect of Genetic Variants of SLC22A2 (rs662301 and rs315978) on the response to Metformin in type 2 Saudi diabetic patients.
To investigate the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the two genetic variations, NC_000006.12: g.160275887C > T (rs662301) and NC_000006.12:g.160231826 T > C (rs315978), in the SLC22A2 gene among the Saudi population. The primary goal is to elucidate potential associations with these genetic variations and the response to metformin therapy over 6 months to enhance our knowledge of the genetic basis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and its clinical management in the Saudi population.
