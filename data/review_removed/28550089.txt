Advancing precision medicine in healthcare: addressing implementation challenges to increase pharmacogenetic testing in the clinical setting.
The incorporation of precision medicine into the clinical setting is becoming increasingly feasible with the availability of more affordable genetic sequencing technologies and successful genetic associations with phenotypes, especially in the pharmacogenomic field. Although substantial progress has been made to ensure successful uptake of pharmacogenomic testing in the clinical setting already, many challenges still remain for sustainable implementation. The importance of pharmacogenomic information in patient care, identifying key barriers, and proposed solutions for advancing pharmacogenomic implementation will be discussed.
