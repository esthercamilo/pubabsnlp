Human glucocorticoid receptor alpha gene (NR3C1) pharmacogenomics: gene resequencing and functional genomics.
The human glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRalpha) is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates multiple physiological and pathophysiological processes. There are large variations in both physiological and therapeutic response to glucocorticoids. Multiple previous studies suggested that genetic polymorphisms in GRalpha (NR3C1) might play an important role.
