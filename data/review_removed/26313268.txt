Effects of UGT1A1 genotype on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicities of belinostat administered by 48-hour continuous infusion in patients with cancer.
The histone deacetylase inhibitor belinostat is eliminated through glucuronidation by UGT1A1. Polymorphisms that reduce UGT1A1 function could result in increased belinostat exposure and toxicities. We wanted to determine which single-nucleotide polymorphisms alter belinostat exposure and toxicity. In a phase 1 trial (belinostat over 48 hours in combination with cisplatin and etoposide), belinostat (400, 500, 600, or 800 mg/m(2) /24 h, 48-hour continuous infusion) was administered to patients with cancer in combination with cisplatin and etoposide (n = 25). Patients were genotyped for UGT1A1 variants associated with reduced function: UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*28, and UGT1A1*60. End points were associations between UGT1A1 genotype and belinostat pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicities, and global protein lysine acetylation (AcK). Belinostat AUC was increased (P = .003), and t1/2 increased (P = .0009) in UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*60 carriers who received more than 400 mg/m(2) /24 h. The incidence of grades 3-4 thrombocytopenia (P = .0081) was associated with UGT1A1 polymorphisms. The US Food and Drug Administration-approved package insert recommends dose adjustment of belinostat for UGT1A1*28. However, our data suggest dose adjustment is also necessary for UGT1A1*60. UGT1A1 polymorphisms were associated with increased systemic belinostat exposure, increased AcK, and increased incidence of toxicities, particularly at doses > 400 mg/m(2) /24 h.
