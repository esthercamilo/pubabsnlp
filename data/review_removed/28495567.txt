Transporters Involved in Metformin Pharmacokinetics and Treatment Response.
Metformin, widely used as first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, exists primarily as a hydrophilic cation at physiological pHs. As such, membrane transporters play a substantial role in its absorption, tissues distribution, and renal elimination. Multiple organic cation transporters are determinants of the pharmacokinetics of metformin, and many of them are important in its pharmacological action, as mediators of metformin entry into target tissues. Furthermore, a recent genome-wide association study in a large multi-ethnic population implicated polymorphisms in SLC2A2, encoding the glucose transporter, GLUT2, as important determinants of response to metformin. Here, we describe the key transporters associated with metformin pharmacokinetics and response.
