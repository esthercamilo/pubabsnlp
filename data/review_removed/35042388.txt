Evaluation of a longitudinal pharmacogenomics education on pharmacist knowledge in a multicampus healthcare system.
<b>Aim:</b> To evaluate the effect of pharmacogenomics (PGx) education for pharmacists. <b>Materials & Methods:</b> Three-part weekly webinar series occurred in 2021. Pharmacists were assessed on their PGx knowledge at baseline and after each webinar. The primary end point was a change in the percent of correct responses between the baseline and week 1 assessment. Secondary end points included change in knowledge at weeks 4-8 and change in self-efficacy. <b>Results:</b> In total, 19 of 58 participants were eligible for the primary analysis, which showed an average improvement of 37% (p < 0.0001). Knowledge remained consistent between week 1 and weeks 4-8. Average self-efficacy increased (p < 0.0001) and was maintained at weeks 4-8. <b>Conclusion:</b> The PGx webinar series resulted in a lasting improvement in PGx knowledge and self-efficacy.
