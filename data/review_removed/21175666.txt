HLA, immunogenetics, pharmacogenetics and personalized medicine.
Displaying the highest level of diversity of any functional genetic complex with medical impact, the HLA system represents a landmark and a model for the development of predictive and preventive medicine. The massive amount of data which will soon be obtained through new high through put technologies for individual genomes and transcriptomes challenges the HLA and medicine paradigm. Systems biology approach and integrative methodologies will undoubtedly be needed to unravel the ever growing number of HLA and diseases associations and the role of immunogenetics in transplantation and other allogeneic cell therapies. Also HLA, immunogenetics and pharmacogenetics are merging to bring to the individual patient tailored and personalized treatment. Providing insights into the complexities of predictive, preventive participatory and personalized medicine, the role of the HLA system will be consolidated at the forefront of the newer medicine.
