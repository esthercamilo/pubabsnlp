Bortezomib in mantle cell lymphoma.
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) represents 6% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, but is one of the most active fields of clinical investigation. Unfortunately, there is still no standard or curative therapy in MCL. Front-line therapy appears to benefit from intensification either through high-dose therapy with stem cell transplant consolidation or dose-intense chemotherapy with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin/doxorubicin and dexamethasone/rituximab. Most patients still relapse and a multitude of novel agents are currently being tested in this setting, including proteasome inhibitors with bortezomib (the first of its class and the first US FDA-approved drug for MCL), mTOR inhibitors, Bcl-2 inhibitors, antiangiogenesis agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors among others. An obvious effort is needed to enroll patients on clinical trials, the design of which might benefit from pharmacogenomics and a better understanding of MCL biology and its diversity.
