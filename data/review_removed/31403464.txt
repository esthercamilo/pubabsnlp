Genetic literacy series: clinical application of pharmacogenetics for adverse reactions to antiepileptic drugs.
Adverse drug reactions are a leading cause of treatment failure with antiepileptic drugs. Adverse drug reactions are also a major source of morbidity and mortality, and a substantial burden on the use and costs of health care. Recent pharmacogenetic studies have shown that some adverse drug reactions are associated with genetic variants, which has changed how we select antiepileptic drugs for individual patients. This article, beginning with a case of an adverse drug reaction induced by carbamazepine, will answer four key questions about pharmacogenetics of adverse drug reactions: (1) What types of adverse drug reactions can be caused by antiepileptic drugs? (2) What is pharmacogenetics? (3) How does pharmacogenetics play a role in the adverse drug reactions of antiepileptic drugs? and (4) How do we apply pharmacogenetic testing in clinical practice? Our goal is to increase awareness of the contributions of genetic variation to adverse drug reactions of antiepileptic drugs.
