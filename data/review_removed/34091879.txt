Genotyping NUDT15*3 rs1166855232 reveals higher frequency of potential adverse effects of thiopurines in Natives and Mestizos from Mexico.
Thiopurines are effectively prescribed for immune and oncology diseases but their toxicity leads to severe myelosuppression. Therefore, TPMT genetic variants have been used to adjust dosing for poor and intermediate metabolizers, significantly preventing adverse drug reactions. In 2018, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium included NUDT15 rs116855232 to also guide thiopurines dosing. This variant is not present in Caucasians but have been identified in 10% of Asian and Latin American populations. Despite research efforts to portrait the world's genetic variation, few studies include the investigation of NUDT15 in large samples.
