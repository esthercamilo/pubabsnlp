Tamoxifen and CYP2D6: A Controversy in Pharmacogenetics.
Tamoxifen reduces the rate of breast cancer recurrence by about one-half. It is converted to more active metabolites by enzymes encoded by polymorphic genes, including cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and transported by ATP-binding cassette transporters. Genetic polymorphisms that confer reduced CYP2D6 activity or concurrent use of CYP2D6-inhibiting drugs may reduce the clinical efficacy of tamoxifen. The issue of the clinical utility of CYP2D6 genotype testing is subject to considerable and ongoing academic and clinical controversy. In this chapter, we outline tamoxifen's clinical pharmacology and give an overview of the research to date on the association between CYP2D6 inhibition and tamoxifen effectiveness. Based on the evidence to date, the impact of drug-induced and/or gene-induced inhibition of CYP2D6 activity is likely to be null or small, or at most moderate in subjects carrying two reduced function alleles. Future research should examine the effect of polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes in tamoxifen's complete metabolic pathway, should comprehensively evaluate other biomarkers that affect tamoxifen effectiveness, such as the transport enzymes, and focus on subgroups of patients, such as premenopausal breast cancer patients, for whom tamoxifen is the only guideline approved endocrine therapy.
