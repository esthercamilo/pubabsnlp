Clinical utility of pharmacogenetics in a psychiatric and primary care population.
This study evaluated the timing, use, and clinical outcomes of the GeneFolio® Pharmacogenomic Panel in a healthcare setting with patients managed by primary care providers or by psychiatrists. Participants were randomized to receive a pharmacogenetics report at four weeks or 12 weeks. After DNA collection and genetic analysis, pharmacists produced a recommendation report which was given to providers at the randomization week. The four-week group decreased depression severity (PHQ-9 and BDI) faster than the 12-week group (p = 0.0196), and psychiatrists' patients decreased their depression severity faster than primary care patients (PHQ-9 p = 0.0005, BDI p = 0.0218). Mean mental quality of life increased over time (p < 0.0001), but it increased slower for patients taking drugs in the Significant drug-drug-gene interaction category (p = 0.0012). Mental quality of life, depression severity, and clinical outcomes were improved by GeneFolio® pharmacogenomic testing regardless of provider type, with earlier testing improving outcomes sooner.
