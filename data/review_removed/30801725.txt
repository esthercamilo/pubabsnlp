A multiplex SNP genotyping by allele-specificspecific PCR based on stem-loop and universal fluorescent primers of Chr1<sup>daxin</sup> mice.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are one of the most common markers in mammals. Rapid, accurate, and multiplex typing of SNPs is critical for subsequent biological and genetic research. In this study, we have developed a novel method for multiplex genotyping SNPs in mice. The method involves allele-specific PCR amplification of genomic DNA with two stem-loop primers accompanied by two different universal fluorescent primers. Blue and green fluorescent signals were conveniently detected on a DNA sequencer. We verified four SNPs of 65 mice based on the novel method, and it is well suited for multiplex genotyping as it requires only one reaction per sample in a single tube with multiplex PCR. The use of universal fluorescent primers greatly reduces the cost of designing different fluorescent probes for each SNP. Therefore, this method can be applied to many biological and genetic studies, such as multiple candidate gene testing, genome-wide association study, pharmacogenetics, and medical diagnostics.
