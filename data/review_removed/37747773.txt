Identification of the effects of pathogenic genetic variations of human <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i>: an <i>in silico</i> approach.
Genetic variations in the human cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 (<i>CYP2C9)</i> and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily D member 6 (<i>CYP2D6)</i> genes may affect drug metabolism and lead to alterations in phenotypes. Genetic variations are associated with toxicity, adverse drug reactions, inefficient treatment. Various <i>in silico</i> tools were combined to investigate the deleterious effects of missense non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) of the human <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i>. The structural and functional effects of the high-risk non-synonymous SNPs in the human <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i> were predicted by numerous computational mutation analysis methods. Out of 24 pathogenic missense SNPs in the <i>CYP2C9</i>, 22 nsSNPs had a decreasing effect on protein stability and 13 SNPs were showed to be located at conserved positions. Out of 27 high-risk deleterious non-synonymous SNPs in the human <i>CYP2D6</i>, 21 SNPs decreased protein stability and 16 nsSNPs were predicted to be positioned at conserved regions. Our present study suggests that the identified functional SNPs may affect drug metabolism associated with CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 enzymes.
