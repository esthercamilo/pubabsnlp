Pharmacogenetic Analysis of the Model-Based Pharmacokinetics of Five Anti-HIV Drugs: How Does This Influence the Effect of Aging?
Analysis of aging and pharmacogenetics (PGx) on antiretroviral pharmacokinetics (PKs) could inform precision dosing for older human HIV-infected patients. Seventy-four participants receiving either atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/RTV) or efavirenz (EFV) with tenofovir/emtricitabine (TFV/FTC) provided PK and PGx information. Aging-PGx-PK association and interaction analyses were conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), multiple linear regression, and Random Forest ensemble methods. Our analyses associated unbound ATV disposition with multidrug resistance protein (MRP)4, RTV with P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and EFV with cytochrome P450 (CYP)2B6 and MRP4 genetic variants. The clearance and cellular distribution of TFV were associated with P-gp, MRP2, and concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs), and FTC parameters were associated with organic cation transporters (OCTs) and MRP2 genetic variants. Notably, p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression, a cellular aging marker, predicted EFV and FTC PK when genetic factors were adjusted. Both age and p16<sup>INK4a</sup> expression interacted with PGx on ATV and TFV disposition, implying potential dose adjustment based on aging may depend on genetic background.
