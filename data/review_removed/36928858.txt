Genomics in Treatment Development.
The Human Genome Project mapped the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome, which ushered in a new generation of genomically focused treatment development. While this has been very successful in other areas, neuroscience has been largely devoid of such developments. This is in large part because there are very few neurological or mental health conditions that are related to single-gene variants. While developments in pharmacogenomics have been somewhat successful, the use of genetic information in practice has to do with drug metabolism and adverse reactions. Studies of drug metabolism related to genetic variations are an important part of drug development. However, outside of cancer biology, the actual translation of genomic information into novel therapies has been limited. Epigenetics, which relates in part to the effects of the environment on DNA, is a promising newer area of relevance to CNS disorders. The environment can induce chemical modifications of DNA (e.g., cytosine methylation), which can be induced by the environment and may represent either shorter- or longer-term changes. Given the importance of environmental influences on CNS disorders, epigenetics may identify important treatment targets in the future.
