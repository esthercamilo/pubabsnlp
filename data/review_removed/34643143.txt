The role of pharmacogenetics in the treatment of anxiety disorders and the future potential for targeted therapeutics.
Anxiety disorders (AD) are among the most common mental disorders worldwide. Pharmacotherapy, including benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants is currently based on 'trial-and-error,' and is effective in a subset of patients or produces partial response only. Recent research proposes that treatment response and tolerability of the drugs are associated with genetic factors.
