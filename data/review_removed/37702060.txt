Integrating pharmacogenomic testing into paired germline and somatic genomic testing in patients with cancer.
Precision medicine has revolutionized clinical care for patients with cancer through the development of targeted therapy, identification of inherited cancer predisposition syndromes and the use of pharmacogenetics to optimize pharmacotherapy for anticancer drugs and supportive care medications. While germline (patient) and somatic (tumor) genomic testing have evolved separately, recent interest in paired germline/somatic testing has led to an increase in integrated genomic testing workflows. However, paired germline/somatic testing has generally lacked the incorporation of germline pharmacogenomics. Integrating pharmacogenomics into paired germline/somatic genomic testing would be an efficient method for increasing access to pharmacogenomic testing. In this perspective, the authors argue for the benefits of implementing a comprehensive approach integrating somatic and germline testing that is inclusive of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice.
