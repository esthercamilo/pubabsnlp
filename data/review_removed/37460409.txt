Children's Oncology Group's 2023 blueprint for research: Pharmacy.
Children's Oncology Group (COG) pharmacists and pharmacy technicians from more than 200 COG-member institutions comprise the COG Pharmacy Discipline. Discipline members serve an essential role in the design and execution of COG clinical trials. Core activities include study drug management, study drug access, clinical trial operations, protocol harmonization, and direct patient care. Discipline members are also actively involved in continuing education, membership engagement, and research across other COG committees/domains. Future areas of committed growth for the discipline include pharmacogenomics, pharmacokinetics, pharmacoeconomics, pharmaceutics, and implementation science.
