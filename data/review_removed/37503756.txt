Association between <i>LEPR</i> Genotype and Gut Microbiome in Healthy Non-Obese Korean Adults.
The <i>LEPR</i> (leptin receptor) genotype is associated with obesity. Gut microbiome composition differs between obese and non-obese adults. However, the impact of <i>LEPR</i> genotype on gut microbiome composition in humans has not yet been studied. In this study, the association between <i>LEPR</i> single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1173100, rs1137101, and rs790419) and the gut microbiome composition in 65 non-obese Korean adults was investigated. Leptin, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were also measured in all participants. Mean ± SD (standard deviation) of age, body mass index, and leptin hormone levels of participants was 35.2 ± 8.1 years, 21.4 ± 1.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 7989.1 ± 6687.4 pg/mL, respectively. Gut microbiome analysis was performed at the phylum level by 16S rRNA sequencing. Among the 11 phyla detected, only one showed significantly different relative abundances between <i>LEPR</i> genotypes. The relative abundance of Candidatus Saccharibacteria was higher in the G/A genotype group than in the G/G genotype group for the rs1137101 single nucleotide polymorphism (<i>p</i>=0.0322). Participant characteristics, including body mass index, leptin levels, and other lipid levels, were similar between the rs1137101 G/G and G/A genotypes. In addition, the relative abundances of Fusobacteria and Tenericutes showed significant positive relationship with plasma leptin concentrations (<i>p</i>=0.0036 and <i>p</i>=0.0000, respectively). In conclusion, <i>LEPR</i> genotype and gut microbiome may be associated even in normal-weight Korean adults. However, further studies with a greater number of obese adults are needed to confirm whether <i>LEPR</i> genotype is related to gut microbiome composition.
