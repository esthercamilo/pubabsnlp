Comfort with Pharmacogenetic Testing Amongst Pediatric Oncology Providers and Their Patients.
<b>Background:</b> Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing, a component of personalized medicine, aims to ensure treatment efficacy while reducing side effects and symptoms. Before this testing becomes routine in the pediatric oncology population, nurses need to understand the knowledge and concerns of providers, patients, and family members with regard to the timing, extent, interpretation, and incorporation of PGx testing. <b>Methods:</b> As part of a comprehensive PGx study (larger study) for children diagnosed with cancer, we surveyed providers and caregivers of children with cancer about their knowledge of and comfort with PGx testing. Caregivers who declined to participate in the larger PGx study were also asked to participate in the survey. Chi-square tests and a two-sample <i>t</i>-test were used to compare variables. <b>Results:</b> One hundred and two participants from the larger PGx study and 12 families who refused (response rate of 77% and 54%, respectively) as well as 29 providers (88%) completed surveys. Families not on the study were less interested in and comfortable with PGx results. Both groups were concerned about health or life insurance discrimination and payment. Providers would like support in ordering PGx testing and interpreting PGx. <b>Discussion:</b> Providers remain wary of most PGx testing, uncomfortable with interpreting and applying the results. Families are interested in the possibilities of personalized prescribing while worried about who has access to their child's genetic information. Further education on relevant tests for providers, including nurses, and the testing process for families, including details on privacy and sharing of genetic information, appear necessary.
