Development of Hif1a Pharmacogenomic Mutation Models to Study Individual Variations in Drug Action for Tumor Hypoxia: An in Silico Approach.
Tumor hypoxia, a predominant feature of solid tumor produces drug resistance that significantly impacts a patient's clinical outcomes. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1Î±) is the major mutation involved in establishing the microenvironment. As a consequence of its involvement in pathways that enable rapid tumor growth, it creates resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments. The propensity of medications to demonstrate drug action often diverges according to the genetic composition. The aim of this study is therefore to examine the effect of population-dependent drug response variations using mutation models.
