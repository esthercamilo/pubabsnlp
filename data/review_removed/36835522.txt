<i>MTHFR</i> c.665C>T and c.1298A>C Polymorphisms in Tailoring Personalized Anti-TNF-α Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease with a prevalence of 1%. Currently, RA treatment aims to achieve low disease activity or remission. Failure to achieve this goal causes disease progression with a poor prognosis. When treatment with first-line drugs fails, treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitors may be prescribed to which many patients do not respond adequately, making the identification of response markers urgent. This study investigated the association of two RA-related genetic polymorphisms, c.665C>T (historically referred to as C677T) and c.1298A>C, in the <i>MTHFR</i> gene as response markers to an anti-TNF-α therapy. A total of 81 patients were enrolled, 60% of whom responded to the therapy. Analyses showed that both polymorphisms were associated with a response to therapy in an allele dose-dependent manner. The association for c.665C>T was significant for a rare genotype (<i>p</i> = 0.01). However, the observed opposite trend of association for c.1298A>C was not significant. An analysis revealed that c.1298A>C, unlike c.665C>T, was also significantly associated with the drug type (<i>p</i> = 0.032). Our preliminary results showed that the genetic polymorphisms in the <i>MTHFR</i> gene were associated with a response to anti-TNF-α therapy, with a potential significance for the anti-TNF-α drug type. This evidence suggests a role for one-carbon metabolism in anti-TNF-α drug efficacy and contributes to further personalized RA interventions.
