Dosage Optimization of Efavirenz Based on a Population Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacogenetic Model of HIV-infected Patients in Thailand.
Efavirenz exhibits high interindividual variability in plasma concentrations, leading to unpredictable efficacy and toxicity. Polymorphism of CYP2B6 516G > T has been found to predominantly contribute to efavirenz variability. However, dosage recommendations incorporating CYP2B6 516G > T polymorphism have not been investigated in the Thai population. This study aimed to develop a population model of the pharmacokinetic properties of efavirenz, and to investigate the impact of patients' characteristics and CYP2B6 516G > T polymorphism on the pharmacokinetic properties of efavirenz. Model-based simulations were performed to provide genotype-based dosage optimization in a Thai population.
