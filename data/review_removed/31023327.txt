Journal of Translational Medicine advances in Translational Genomics and Genetics Era.
We are delighted to announce the launch of a new section in the Journal of Translational Medicine, 'Translational Genomics and Genetics'. Central to translational medicine trend is the ability to sequence, annotate and interpret the genomic variants in a given patient to guide precision diagnosis and personalized treatment. This new section intends to promote the translation of emerging genomic technologies into clinical applications. The coverage extends to basic, translational and clinical studies related to human genomics and genetics. The manuscripts in following categories are welcome, but not limited to: Application of next generation sequencing in clinical diagnosis, including but not limited to rare genetic disease, complex inherited disease, prenatal/perinatal screening, oncology, organ transplantation and pathogen identification; Novel bioinformatics approaches in human genomics; Single cell sequencing, liquid biopsy and other emerging genomic assays in molecular genetics, pharmacogenomics, oncology and immuno-oncology; Integration of genomics with other "omics" technology in genetic medicine.
