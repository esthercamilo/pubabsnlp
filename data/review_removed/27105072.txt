How close are we to individualized medicine for Parkinson's disease?
There is a considerable inter-individual heterogeneity in clinical features, disease course, and treatment response in Parkinson's disease (PD), which can be explained not only by disease process and clinical variables, but also by an impact from genetic factors. Evidence-based medicine relies on large randomized control trials and meta-analysis-average medicine, which ignores individual differences. However, we are now in the early phases of a paradigm shift in medicine relating to individuality and variability. The purpose of individualized medicine is to predict patients' responses to targeted therapy using diagnostic tests based on genetics or other molecular mechanisms, thus providing the right drug at the right dose at the right time.
