Network Pharmacology to Identify the Pharmacological Mechanisms of a Traditional Chinese Medicine Derived from Trachelospermum jasminoides in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.
BACKGROUND This study used a network pharmacology approach to identify the pharmacological mechanisms of a traditional Chinese medicine derived from Trachelospermum jasminoides (Lindl.) Lem. in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). MATERIAL AND METHODS Known compounds of T. jasminoides were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database, the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry of Chinese Academy of Science, Chemistry (CASC) database, and a literature search. Putative targets of identified compounds were predicted by SwissTargetPrediction. RA-related targets were achieved from the Therapeutic Target database, Drugbank database, Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase, and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built by STRING. CluGO was utilized for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. RESULTS A total of 354 potential targets were predicted for the 17 bioactive compounds in T. jasminoides; 69 of these targets overlapped with RA-related targets. A PPI network was composed and 2 clusters of 59 and 42 nodes each were excavated. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of the overlapping targets and the 2 clusters was mainly grouped into immunity, inflammation, estrogen, anxiety, and depression processes. CONCLUSIONS Our study illustrated that T. jasminoides alleviates RA through the interleukin-17 signaling pathway, the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, and other immune and inflammatory-related processes. It also may exert effects in regulating cell differentiation and potentially has anti-anxiety, anti-depression, and estrogen-like effects.
