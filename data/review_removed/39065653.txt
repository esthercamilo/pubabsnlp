Novel Genetic Variants Explaining Severe Adverse Drug Events after Clinical Implementation of <i>DPYD</i> Genotype-Guided Therapy with Fluoropyrimidines: An Observational Study.
Fluoropyrimidines (FPs) are commonly prescribed in many cancer streams. The EMA and FDA-approved drug labels for FPs recommend genotyping the <i>DPYD</i>*2A (rs3918290), *13 (rs55886062), *HapB3 (rs56038477), alleles, and <i>DPYD</i> rs67376798 before treatment starts. We implemented the <i>DPYD</i> genotyping in our daily clinical routine, but we still found patients showing severe adverse drug events (ADEs) to FPs. We studied among these patients the <i>DPYD</i> rs1801265, rs17376848, rs1801159, rs1801160, rs1801158, and rs2297595 as explanatory candidates of the interindividual differences for FP-related toxicities, examining the association with the response to FPs . We also studied the impact of <i>DPYD</i> testing for FP dose tailoring in our clinical practice and characterized the <i>DPYD</i> gene in our population. We found a total acceptance among physicians of therapeutic recommendations translated from the <i>DPYD</i> test, and this dose tailoring does not affect the treatment efficacy. We also found that the <i>DPYD</i>*4 (defined by rs1801158) allele is associated with a higher risk of ADEs (severity grade â‰¥ 3) in both the univariate (O.R. = 5.66; 95% C.I. = 1.35-23.67; <i>p</i> = 0.014) and multivariate analyses (O.R. = 5.73; 95% C.I. = 1.41-28.77; <i>p</i> = 0.019) among FP-treated patients based on the <i>DPYD</i> genotype. This makes it a candidate variant for implementation in clinical practice.
