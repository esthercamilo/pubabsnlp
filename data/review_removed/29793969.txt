Clinical Pharmacogenomics: Applications in Nephrology.
Pharmacogenomics is a tool for practitioners to provide precision pharmacotherapy using genomics. All providers are likely to encounter genomic data in practice with the expectation that they are able to successfully apply it to patient care. Pharmacogenomics tests for genetic variations in genes that are responsible for drug metabolism, transport, and targets of drug action. Variations can increase the risk for drug toxicity or poor efficacy. Pharmacogenomics can, therefore, be used to help select the best medication or aid in dosing. Nephrologists routinely treat cardiovascular disease and manage patients after kidney transplantation, two situations for which there are several high-evidence clinical recommendations for commonly used anticoagulants, antiplatelets, statins, and transplant medications. Successful use of pharmacogenomics in practice requires that providers are familiar with how to access and use pharmacogenomics resources. Similarly, clinical decision making related to whether to use existing data, whether to order testing, and if data should be used in practice is needed to deliver precision medicine. Pharmacogenomics is applicable to virtually every medical specialty, and nephrologists are well positioned to be implementation leaders.
