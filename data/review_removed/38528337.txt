Utilizing Pharmacogenomics Results to Guide Antidepressant Selection: A Case Report.
The case discussion demonstrates the benefit of using Pharmacogenomic (PGx) results to aid in the selection of antidepressant therapy and improve response to treatment. Nearly half of patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder fail initial therapy and may require multiple trials of antidepressants. Genetic variation in several metabolic enzymes contribute to the variable response to antidepressant therapy. PGx testing provides an opportunity to inform antidepressant selection and optimize therapeutic outcomes, while minimizing risk of adverse events. A 79-year-old female who had been experiencing a suboptimal response to escitalopram following dose escalation over a period of three years was referred for a PGx consultation. A clinical pharmacist assessed significant drug-gene, drug-drug, and drug-drug-gene interactions, and relevant clinical information to recommend alternative antidepressant therapy, which resulted in mood improvement.
