Evaluation of metformin in combination with rifampicin containing antituberculosis therapy in patients with new, smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (METRIF): study protocol for a randomised clinical trial.
Shorter duration of treatment for the management of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) would be a significant improvement in the care of patients suffering from the disease. Besides newer drugs and regimens, other modalities like host-directed therapy are also being suggested to reach this goal. This study's objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin-containing anti-TB treatment (ATT) regimen in comparison to the standard 6-month ATT regimen in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive drug-sensitive pulmonary TB.
