The Influence of the <i>CES1</i> Genotype on the Pharmacokinetics of Enalapril in Patients with Arterial Hypertension.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril is hydrolysed to an active metabolite, enalaprilat, in the liver via carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). Previous studies show that variant rs71647871 in the CES1 gene affects the pharmacokinetics of enalapril on liver samples as well as healthy volunteers. This study included 286 Caucasian patients with arterial hypertension who received enalapril. The concentrations of enalapril and enalaprilat were determined before subsequent intake of the drug and 4 h after it with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometric detection. The study included genetic markers as follows: rs2244613, rs71647871 (c.428G>A, p.G143E) and three SNPs indicating the presence of a subtype CES1A1c (rs12149368, rs111604615 and rs201577108). Mean peak and trough enalaprilat concentrations, adjusted by clinical variables, were significantly lower in CES1 rs2244613 heterozygotes (by 16.6% and 19.6%) and in CC homozygotes (by 32.7% and 41.4%) vs. the AA genotype. In CES1A1c homozygotes, adjusted mean enalaprilat concentrations were 75% lower vs. heterozygotes and wild-type (WT) homozygotes. Pharmacogenetic markers of the CES1 gene may be a promising predictor for individualisation when prescribing enalapril.
