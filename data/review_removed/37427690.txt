Genetic polymorphisms of very important pharmacogene variants in the Chinese Lisu population.
<b>Aim:</b> Interindividual and interethnic differences in drug efficacy drive the development and progress of pharmacogenomics and precision medicine. This study was performed to enrich the pharmacogenomic information for the Lisu population from China. <b>Methods:</b> 54 very important pharmacogene variants were selected from PharmGKB and genotyped in 199 Lisu individuals. The genotype distribution data of 26 populations were downloaded from the 1000 Genomes Project and analyzed with the χ<sup>2</sup> test. <b>Results:</b> Among the 26 populations in the 1000 Genomes Project, African Caribbeans in Barbados; Esan in Nigeria; Gambian in Western Divisions, The Gambia; Luhya in Webuye, Kenya; Yoruba in Ibadan; Finnish in Finland; Toscani in Italy and Sri Lankan Tamil in the UK were the top eight nationalities with the most significant differences in genotype distribution from the Lisu population. The loci of <i>CYP3A</i>5 rs776746, <i>KCNH2</i> rs1805123, <i>ACE</i> rs4291, <i>SLC19A1</i> rs1051298 and <i>CYP2D6</i> rs1065852 were significantly different in the Lisu. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results showed that there were substantial differences in SNPs of very important pharmacogene variants, which can provide a theoretical basis for individualized drug use for the Lisu.
