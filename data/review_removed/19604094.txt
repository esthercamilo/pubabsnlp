Rapid and cost-effective SNP detection method: application of SmartAmp2 to pharmacogenomics research.
Pharmacogenomics data can facilitate our understanding of the sources of variability in drug response, which can potentially lead to improved safety and efficacy of drug therapy for individual patients. A key requirement for the development of individualized medicine or personalized therapy is the ability to rapidly and conveniently test patients for genetic polymorphisms and/or mutations. However, in today's world, genotyping technology remains a bottleneck in clinical applications because of its slow speed and high cost. Therefore, we have recently developed a rapid and cost-effective method for SNP detection, named Smart Amplification Process 2 (SmartAmp2), which enables us to detect genetic polymorphisms or mutations in 30-45 min under isothermal conditions without DNA isolation and PCR amplification. This article presents the SNP detection method and its underlying molecular mechanism as well as clinical research applications.
