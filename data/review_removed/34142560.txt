Pharmacogenomic landscape of COVID-19 therapies from Indian population genomes.
<b>Aim:</b> Numerous drugs are being widely prescribed for COVID-19 treatment without any direct evidence for the drug safety/efficacy in patients across diverse ethnic populations. <b>Materials & methods:</b> We analyzed whole genomes of 1029 Indian individuals (IndiGen) to understand the extent of drug-gene (pharmacogenetic), drug-drug and drug-drug-gene interactions associated with COVID-19 therapy in the Indian population. <b>Results:</b> We identified 30 clinically significant pharmacogenetic variants and 73 predicted deleterious pharmacogenetic variants. COVID-19-associated pharmacogenes were substantially overlapped with those of metabolic disorder therapeutics. <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>ALB</i> are the most shared pharmacogenes. Fifteen COVID-19 therapeutics were predicted as likely drug-drug interaction candidates when used with four <i>CYP</i> inhibitor drugs. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings provide actionable insights for future validation studies and improved clinical decisions for COVID-19 therapy in Indians.
