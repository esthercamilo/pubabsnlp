FKBP-CaN-NFAT pathway polymorphisms selected by in silico biological function prediction are associated with tacrolimus efficacy in renal transplant patients.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential effects of genetic variations in the FKBP-CaN-NFAT pathway on clinical events associated with tacrolimus efficacy in Chinese renal transplant patients.
