Physician-guided, hybrid genetic testing exerts promising effects on health-related behavior without compromising quality of life.
Genetic risk analysis is increasingly in demand by participants. Hybrid genetic testing has the advantage over direct to consumer testing by involving a physician who guides the process and offers counseling after receiving the results. The objective of this study was to determine whether a structured physician moderated primary preventive, hybrid genetic risk assessment enhanced counseling program leads to improvement in lifestyle and does not impair quality of life. Risk genes for malignant, cardiovascular, coagulation, storage diseases and pharmacogenetics (> 100 genes) were tested. Screening, consultation and genetic counseling embedded in a primary/secondary prevention check-up program for executives of surrounding companies took place in a single center in Germany. Follow-up included established questionnaires for quality of life, nutrition and physical activity. Analysis included n = 244 participants. Median age at baseline was 49 years (interquartile range: 44-55), 93% were male, 3% (n = 7 of 136 responses) were smoker. Mean body mass index was 25.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Follow-up response rate was 74% (n = 180), mean follow-up time was 6.8 months (standard deviation = 2.1). In 91 participants (37.8%, 91/241) at least one pathogenic variant was found, 60 thereof were clinically relevant (24.9%, 60/241). 238 participants (98%, 238/241) had > 1 pharmacogenetic variant, only 2 (0.8%, 2/241) took a correspondingly affected drug (56 participants took ≥ 1 drug/day). The energy expenditure significantly increased by ≈ 35% [median multiple of energy expenditure of 1.34 (confidence interval = 1.15-1.57, p < 0.001)] metabolic equivalents of task (MET)-min/week; participants spent on average 41 min (p < 0.001) less in sedentary activities per day and spent more time for lunch (≈ 2 additional minutes/day; p = 0.031). Indicators of the consumption of red meat and sweet pastries significantly decreased (both adjusted p = 0.049). Neither quality of life in general nor subgroup analysis of participants with at least one conspicuous genetic risk differed significantly over follow-up. Hybrid genetic testing and counseling exerted positive effects on health-related behavior and was not associated with major psychological adverse effects in the short-term follow-up. The approach seems to be feasible for use in preventive health care.
