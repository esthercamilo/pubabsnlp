Implications of a Genetic Etiology for Renal Transplant: Early-Onset Alport Syndrome with a Novel Mutation.
Alport's syndrome (AS) is a rare disorder characterized by a triad of deafness, progressive renal dysfunction, and ocular abnormalities. We presented a patient of early onset AS with a novel frameshift pathogenic variant in the <i>COL4A5 gene</i> and discuss the utility of genetic testing in the family as well as for the transplant recipient. The patient was a 17-year-old adolescent male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hearing loss. In the setting of ESRD, since hearing loss and anterior lenticonus was detected on an ophthalmologic exam, AS was suspected. On genetic testing, a novel hemizygous frameshift variant was identified in the <i>COL4A5</i> gene (c.1392del (p.Asp464GlufsTer10)), which was also segregated in the family. In this report, we discussed the early severe presentation, typical ocular findings, genotype-phenotype correlation, and implications of genetic testing for renal transplant. We also explored the challenges of genetic testing in developing countries and the potential of pharmacogenomics.
