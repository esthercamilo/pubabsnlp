Genetics of clozapine-associated neutropenia: recent advances, challenges and future perspective.
Clozapine is the only effective antipsychotic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia but remains widely under prescribed, at least in part due to its potential to cause agranulocytosis and neutropenia. In this article, we provide an overview of the current understanding of the genetics of clozapine-associated agranulocytosis and neutropenia. We now know that the genetic etiology of clozapine-associated neutropenia is complex and is likely to involve variants from several genes including HLA-DQB1, HLA-B and SLCO1B3/SLCO1B7. We describe recent findings relating to the Duffy-null genotype and its association with benign neutropenia in individuals with African ancestry. Further advances will come from sequencing studies, large, cross-population studies and in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations.
