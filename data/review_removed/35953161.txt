Cytochrome P450 enzymes in the pediatric population: Connecting knowledge on P450 expression with pediatric pharmacokinetics.
Cytochrome P450 enzymes play an important role in the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity of drugs. Age-dependent changes in P450 enzyme expression have been studied based on several detection systems, as well as by deconvolution of in vivo pharmacokinetic data observed in pediatric populations. The age-dependent changes in P450 enzyme expression can be important determinants of drug disposition in childhood, in addition to the changes in body size and the other physiological parameters, and effects of pharmacogenetics and disease on organ functions. As a tool incorporating drug-specific and body-specific factors, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models have become increasingly used to characterize and explore mechanistic insights into drug disposition. Thus, PBPK models can be a bridge between findings from basic science and utilization in predictive science. Pediatric PBPK models incorporate additional system specific information on developmental physiology and ontogeny and have been used to predict pharmacokinetic parameters from preterm neonates onwards. These models have been advocated by regulatory authorities in order to support pediatric clinical trials. The purpose of this chapter is to highlight accumulated knowledge and findings from basic research focusing on P450 enzymes, as well as the current status and future challenges of expanding the utilization of pediatric PBPK modeling.
