Psychiatric Level 1A evidence pharmacogenomics in a Brazilian admixed cohort and global populations.
<b>Purpose:</b> To compare minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of psychiatric drug response variants in a Brazilian admixed cohort with global populations and other Brazilian groups. <b>Methods:</b> PharmGKB MAFs were gathered from publicly available genetic datasets for Brazil and worldwide. <b>Results:</b> Among 146 variants in <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i>, 41 were present in Brazil, mostly rare (MAF <1%). 11 variants showed significant MAF differences with large effect sizes compared with global populations. <i>CYP2C19*3</i> (rs4986893), <i>CYP2C19*17</i> (rs12248560), <i>CYP2D6*17</i> (rs28371706-A) and <i>CYP2D6*29</i> (rs61736512) exhibited higher frequencies in Brazil, with the latter three also differing from other Brazilian groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study highlights significant pharmacogenomic diversity in Brazil and globally, underscoring the need for more research in personalized psychiatric drug therapy.
