An update on CYP2C9 polymorphisms and phenytoin metabolism: implications for adverse effects.
Introduction Phenytoin is a frequently used drug treatment for epilepsy. Genetic polymorphisms in the metabolism of phenytoin, particularly <i>CYP2C9</i>, are strongly associated with increased plasma concentrations and can result in toxicity. Human leukocyte antigen (<i>HLA</i>) alleles are well-known genetic predictors of certain antiepileptic drug-associated severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Recent pharmacogenomic studies show genetic polymorphisms in <i>CYP2C9</i>, as well as <i>HLA</i> alleles, are significantly associated with phenytoin-related SCAR. Areas covered Updated pharmacogenomic information of <i>CYP2C9</i> variants and <i>HLA</i> alleles involved in phenytoin-associated cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) are discussed in this article. Expert opinion CYP2C9*3 has been identified as the most significant genetic variant associated with increased phenytoin concentrations and adverse events. Recent pharmacogenomic findings reveal that <i>CYP2C9*3</i> and <i>HLA</i> alleles, i.e. <i>HLA-B*15:02, HLA-B*13:01</i>, and <i>HLA-B*51:01</i>, are important genetic variants in the occurrence of phenytoin-induced cADRs or SCAR. A phenotype- and population-specific multigene panel can be used before prescribing to predict phenytoin-induced cADRs and further guide optimal dose selection.
