Sex- and Genotype-Dependent Nicotine-Induced Behaviors in Adolescent Rats with a Human Polymorphism (rs2304297) in the 3'-UTR of the <i>CHRNA</i>6 Gene.
In human adolescents, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs2304297, in the 3'-UTR of the nicotinic receptor subunit gene, <i>CHRNA</i>6, has been associated with increased smoking. To study the effects of the human <i>CHRNA6</i> 3'-UTR SNP, our lab generated knock-in rodent lines with either C or G SNP alleles. The objective of this study was to determine if the <i>CHRNA6</i> 3'-UTR SNP is functional in the knock-in rat lines. We hypothesized that the human <i>CHRNA6</i> 3'-UTR SNP knock-in does not impact baseline but enhances nicotine-induced behaviors. For baseline behaviors, rats underwent food self-administration at escalating schedules of reinforcement followed by a locomotor assay and a series of anxiety tests (postnatal day (PN) 25-39). In separate cohorts, adolescent rats underwent 1- or 4-day nicotine pretreatment (2×, 30 μg/kg/0.1 mL, i.v.). After the last nicotine injection (PN 31), animals were assessed behaviorally in an open-field chamber, and brain tissue was collected. We show the human <i>CHRNA6</i> 3'-UTR SNP knock-in does not affect food reinforcement, locomotor activity, or anxiety. Further, 4-day, but not 1-day, nicotine exposure enhances locomotion and anxiolytic behavior in a genotype- and sex-specific manner. These findings demonstrate that the human <i>CHRNA6</i> 3'-UTR SNP is functional in our in vivo model.
