A Novel Approach for the Identification of Pharmacogenetic Variants in <i>MT-RNR1</i> through Next-Generation Sequencing Off-Target Data.
Specific genetic variants in the mitochondrially encoded 12S ribosomal RNA gene (<i>MT-RNR1</i>) cause aminoglycoside-induced irreversible hearing loss. Mitochondrial DNA is usually not included in targeted sequencing experiments; however, off-target data may deliver this information. Here, we extract <i>MT-RNR1</i> genetic variation, including the most relevant ototoxicity variant m.1555A>G, using the off-target reads of 473 research samples, sequenced through a capture-based, custom-targeted panel and whole exome sequencing (WES), and of 1245 diagnostic samples with clinical WES. Sanger sequencing and fluorescence-based genotyping were used for genotype validation. There was a correlation between off-target reads and mitochondrial coverage (r<sub>customPanel</sub> = 0.39, <i>p</i> = 2 × 10<sup>-13</sup> and rWES = 0.67, <i>p</i> = 7 × 10<sup>-21</sup>). The median read depth of <i>MT-RNR1</i> m.1555 was similar to the average mitochondrial genome coverage, with saliva and blood samples giving comparable results. The genotypes from 415 samples, including three m.1555G carriers, were concordant with fluorescence-based genotyping data. In clinical WES, median <i>MT-RNR1</i> coverage was 56×, with 90% of samples having ≥20 reads at m.1555 position, and one m.1494T and three m.1555G carriers were identified with no evidence for heteroplasmy. Altogether, this study shows that obtaining <i>MT-RNR1</i> genotypes through off-target reads is an efficient strategy that can impulse preemptive pharmacogenetic screening of this mitochondrial gene.
