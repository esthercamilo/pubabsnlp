Clinical pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs in older persons.
Combination antiretroviral therapy has enabled HIV-infected persons to reach older ages in high numbers. Hepatic and renal changes that normally occur with advancing age occur earlier and with higher incidence in HIV-infected individuals. A limited number of prospective controlled studies have demonstrated small reductions (17 to 41%) in lopinavir, atazanavir and lamivudine clearance in older versus younger adults. A much larger number of retrospective studies in adults (age range âˆ¼ 20 to 60 years), including all antiretroviral drugs, have evaluated age as a covariate for pharmacokinetics. Most studies did not detect substantial associations between drug exposures and age.
