Design and methods of the prevalence and pharmacogenomics of tenofovir nephrotoxicity in HIV-positive adults in south-western Nigeria study.
Individuals of African descent are at higher risk of developing kidney disease than their European counterparts, and HIV infection is associated with increased risk of nephropathy. Despite a safe renal profile in the clinical trials, long-term use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) has been associated with proximal renal tubulopathy although the underlying mechanisms remain undetermined. We aim to establish the prevalence of and risk factors for TDF-induced kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD) among HIV-I and II individuals treated with TDF in south-west Nigeria. Association between TDF-induced KTD and genetic polymorphisms in renal drug transporter genes and the APOL1 (Apolipoprotein L1) gene will be examined.
