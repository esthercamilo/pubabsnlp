Changing from mandatory to optional genotyping results in higher acceptance of pharmacist-guided warfarin dosing.
<b>Aim:</b> We evaluated the clinical acceptance and feasibility of a pharmacist-guided personalized consult service following its transition from a mandatory (mPGx) to optional (oPGx) <i>CYP2C9</i>/<i>VKORC1</i>/<i>CYP4F2</i> genotyping for warfarin. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1105 patients were included. Clinical acceptance and feasibility outcomes were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable analyses. <b>Results:</b> After transitioning to optional genotyping, genotype testing was still ordered in a large segment of the eligible population (52.1%). Physician acceptance of pharmacist-recommended doses improved from 83.9% (mPGx) to 86.6% (oPGx; OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1-1.5; p = 0.01) with a shorter median genotype result turnaround time (oPGX: 23.6 h vs mPGX: 25.1 h; p < 0.01). <b>Conclusion</b>: Ordering of genotype testing and provider acceptance of dosing recommendations remained high after transitioning to optional genotyping.
