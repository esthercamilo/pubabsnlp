Increasing engagement in pharmacology and pharmacogenetics education using games and online resources: The PharmacoloGenius mobile app.
Mobile applications represent useful instruments to convey information and engage the users even during traveling, thanks to the wide diffusion of smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and similar devices. As such, they have high potential as learning tools that can act complementary to traditional teaching approaches. In the field of pharmacology, mobile applications are increasingly being used to improve adherence of patients or to help them report suspect adverse drug reactions. However, they have been scarcely applied to pharmacology education. In this article, we present PharmacoloGenius, a free Android mobile application integrating resources useful for students as well as healthcare professionals or researchers to expand knowledge on pharmacological topics. We gave particular emphasis to pharmacogenetics, as it is a fundamental tool to achieve personalized treatment. The application offers original games such as pharmacological trivia based on textbooks or special "journal club" trivia based on research articles conveying the state of the art on specific topics. Additionally, the app offers a curated list of online resources to study pharmacology and pharmacogenetics (e.g., free online courses, videos, and databases) as well as updated news on conferences, grants, and opportunities for pharmacologists. In conclusion, PharmacoloGenius aims to be a useful instrument for people interested in expanding their knowledge on pharmacology in an engaging way.
