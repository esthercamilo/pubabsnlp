Characterization of <i>CYP2C19</i> pharmacogenetic variation in African populations and comparison with other global populations.
<b>Background:</b> <i>CYP2C19</i> is important in the metabolism of clopidogrel and several antidepressants. This study aimed to characterize the distribution of <i>CYP2C19</i> star alleles (haplotypes) across diverse African populations compared with global populations. <b>Methods:</b> <i>CYP2C19</i> star alleles and diplotypes were called from high coverage genomes using the StellarPGx pipeline. <b>Results:</b> <i>CYP2C19*1</i> (51%), <i>*2</i> (17%) and <i>*17</i> (22%) were the most common star alleles across African populations in this study. It was observed that 3% of African participants had potentially novel <i>CYP2C19</i> haplotypes. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study supports the necessity for <i>CYP2C19</i> pharmacogenetic testing in African and global clinical settings, as well as the importance of comprehensive star allele characterization in the African context.
