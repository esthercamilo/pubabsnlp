Will the Use of Pharmacogenetics Improve Treatment Efficiency in COVID-19?
The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a global health crisis and the greatest challenge for scientists and doctors. The virus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome with an outcome that is fatal in more vulnerable populations. Due to the need to find an efficient treatment in a short time, there were several drugs that were repurposed or repositioned for COVID-19. There are many types of available COVID-19 therapies, including antiviral agents (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir), antibiotics (azithromycin), antiparasitics (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin), and corticosteroids (dexamethasone). A combination of antivirals with various mechanisms of action may be more efficient. However, the use of some of these medicines can be related to the occurrence of adverse effects. Some promising drug candidates have been found to be ineffective in clinical trials. The knowledge of pharmacogenetic issues, which translate into variability in drug conversion from prodrug into drug, metabolism as well as transport, could help to predict treatment efficiency and the occurrence of adverse effects in patients. However, many drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19 have not undergone pharmacogenetic studies, perhaps as a result of the lack of time.
