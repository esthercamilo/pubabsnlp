Interview: Russ Altman speaks to Shreeya Nanda, Commissioning Editor.
Russ Biagio Altman is a professor of bioengineering, genetics, and medicine (and of computer science by courtesy) and chairman of the Bioengineering Department at Stanford University, CA, USA. His primary research interests are in the application of computing technology to basic molecular biological problems of relevance to medicine. He is currently developing techniques for collaborative scientific computation over the internet, including novel user interfaces to biological data, particularly for pharmacogenomics. Other work focuses on the analysis of functional microenvironments within macromolecules and the application of algorithms for determining the structure, dynamics and function of biological macromolecules. Dr Altman holds an MD from Stanford Medical School, a PhD in medical information sciences from Stanford, and an AB from Harvard College, MA, USA. He has been the recipient of the US Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers and a National Science Foundation CAREER Award. He is a fellow of the American College of Physicians and the American College of Medical Informatics. He is a past-president and founding board member of the International Society for Computational Biology and an organizer of the annual Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing. He leads one of seven NIH-supported National Centers for Biomedical Computation, focusing on physics-based simulation of biological structures. He won the Stanford Medical School graduate teaching award in 2000.
