Severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity: clinical implications of DPYD analysis and UH2/U ratio evaluation.
The fluoropyrimidines are commonly used in chemotherapeutic cancer medicine, but many patients still experience severe adverse side effects from these drugs. We observed a severe toxicity in a 50-year-old woman treated with capecitabine and docetaxel for a metastatic breast cancer. Since dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the main candidate for pharmacogenetic studies on 5-FU toxicity, the entire coding sequence and exon-flanking intronic regions of the DPYD gene were sequenced in the patient. None of the previously described deleterious variants were detected. Also, the haplotype-based analysis failed to reveal DPYD variations associated with 5-FU toxicity. We also evaluated the UH2/U ratio in plasma as an index of 5-FU pharmacokinetics. The UH2/U value did not demonstrate low DPD activity in the patient. We discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach, particularly concerning the clinical applications of 5-FU pharmacogenetics in the family setting.
