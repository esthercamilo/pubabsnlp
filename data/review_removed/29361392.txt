Preschool wheeze, genes and treatment.
Preschool wheeze is a common but poorly understood cause of respiratory morbidity that is both distinct from and overlaps with infantile bronchiolitis and school age asthma. Attempts at classification by epidemiology, pathophysiology, therapeutic response and clinical phenotype are imperfect and yet fundamental to both treatment choice and research design. The four main therapeutic classes for preschool wheeze, namely beta<sub>2</sub> agonists, anticholinergics, corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers are employed with variable and often scanty evidence base, with evidence for a genetic influence on response variations. The article will discuss the pharmacogenetics of the various options, summarise current treatment recommendations, and explore future research directions.
