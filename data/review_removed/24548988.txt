Is there a need to teach pharmacogenetics?
Pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics has been subject to considerable development during the past 10 years and seems likely to advance even more rapidly in the next decade. Several surveys suggest that initial training for health-care professionals-particularly physicians and pharmacists-frequently includes education in this area, but equipping these professions more generally to deal with ongoing development of the field and to make best use of new knowledge remains an important challenge.
