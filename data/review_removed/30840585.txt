Combined evaluation of genotype and phenotype of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) in the clinical management of patients in chronic therapy with azathioprine.
Background The thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT)/azathioprine (AZA) gene-drug pair is one of the most well-known pharmacogenetic markers. Despite this, few studies investigated the implementation of TPMT testing and the combined evaluation of genotype and phenotype in multidisciplinary clinical settings where patients are undergoing chronic therapy with AZA. Methods A total of 356 AZA-treated patients for chronic autoimmune diseases were enrolled. DNA was isolated from whole blood and the samples were analyzed for the c.460G>A and c.719A>G variants by the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique and sequenced for the c.238G>C variant. The TPMT enzyme activity was determined in erythrocytes by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. Results All the patients enrolled were genotyped while the TPMT enzyme activity was assessed in 41 patients. Clinical information was available on 181 patients. We found no significant difference in the odds of having adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in wild-type patients and variant allele carriers, but the latter had an extra risk of experiencing hematologically adverse events. The enzyme activity was significantly associated to genotype. Conclusions TPMT variant allele carriers have an extra risk of experiencing hematologically adverse events compared to wild-type patients. Interestingly, only two out of 30 (6.6%) patients had discordant results between genotype, phenotype and onset of ADRs.
