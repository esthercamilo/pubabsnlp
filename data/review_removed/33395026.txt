Ligand-specific pharmacogenetic effects of nonsynonymous mutations.
In pharmacogenomics, variable receptor phenotypes, resulting from genetic polymorphisms, are often described as a change in protein function or regulation observed upon exposure to a drug. However, in some instances, phenotypes are defined using a class of medications rather than individual drugs. This paradigm assumes that a variation associated with a drug response phenotype will retain the magnitude and direction of the effect for other drugs with the same mechanism of action. However, nonsynonymous polymorphisms may have ligand-specific effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential for point mutations to asymmetrically affect the binding of different drugs to a common target. Ligand binding data from site-directed mutagenesis studies on five G-protein coupled receptors (beta-1 and -2 adrenergic, dopamine D2, angiotensin II and mu-opioid receptor) were collected and analyzed. Binding data from 81 studies for 253 ligands with 447 mutant proteins, including 10 naturally occurring human variants, were analyzed, yielding 1989 mutation-ligand pairs. Fold change in binding affinity for mutant proteins, relative to the wild-type, for different drugs was examined for ligand-specific effects, with a fold-change difference of one or more orders of magnitude between agents considered significant. Of the mutations examined, 49% were associated with ligand-specific effects. One human variant (T164I, beta-2 adrenergic receptor) showed ligand-specific effects for antiasthmatic agents. These results indicate that ligand-specific changes in binding are a possible consequence of missense mutations. This implies that caution needs to be exercised when grouping drugs together during design or interpretation of genotype-phenotype association studies.
