Pharmacogenetics of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI): A serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT)-based approach.
Neuropsychiatric disorders are considered to be the most common cause of disability worldwide. Serotonin and its transporter is a prominent paradigm in mood disorders. Response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) is altered due to heterogeneity in the serotonin transporter gene, SLC6A4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4). The reported polymorphisms are found to be in different regions of the transporter gene: promoter region (5-HTTLPR and various single nucleotide polymorphisms within it), intron (STin2), and exon 9 (I425V). The long and short alleles of the 5-HTTLPR gene, which are prevalent among variations, may mediate differential effects. In long allelic variant carriers, an increased response to SSRI and timely recovery is due to increased availability of SERT. Whereas, SERT availability is significantly decreased in short allelic carriers, necessitating a reduction in SSRI dosage due to the increased risk of adverse drug reactions. Thus, pharmacogenetic investigations are required to understand the impact of functional variations on the efficacy and tolerability of SSRI. Identifying the carrier variants may aid in clear-decision making of the treatment regimen, aiding the approach of personalized medication.
