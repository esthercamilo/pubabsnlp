Dosing algorithms for vitamin K antagonists across VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotypes.
Essentials Prospective studies of pharmacogenetic-guided (PG) coumarin dosing produced varying results. EU-PACT acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon trials compared PG and non-PG dosing algorithms. Sub-analysis of EU-PACT identified differences between trial arms across VKORC1-CYP2C9 groups. Adjustment of the PG algorithm might lead to a higher benefit of genotyping.
