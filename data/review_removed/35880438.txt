Investigation of <i>DPYD</i>, <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>TYMS</i> polymorphisms on 5-fluorouracil related toxicities in colorectal cancer.
<b>Aim:</b> To investigate the association of <i>DPYD</i>, <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>TYMS</i> polymorphisms on 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) related toxicities and patient survival. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A total of 103 colorectal cancer patients prescribed 5-FU were included in the study. Genotyping was conducted for several <i>DPYD</i>, <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>TYMS</i> polymorphisms using a microarray analyzer. <b>Results:</b> <i>DPYD</i> 496A>G polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with 5-FU related grade 0-2, but not severe toxicities (p = 0.02). Furthermore, patients with <i>DPYD</i> 85TC and CC genotypes had longer progression and overall survival times compared to TT genotypes in our study group (log rank = 6.60; p = 0.01 and log rank = 4.40; p = 0.04, respectively). <b>Conclusion:</b> According to our results, <i>DPYD</i> 496AG and GG genotypes might be protective against severe adverse events compared to the AA genotype. Another <i>DPYD</i> polymorphism, 85T>C, may be useful in colorectal cancer prognosis. Further studies for both polymorphisms should be conducted in larger populations to achieve accurate results.
