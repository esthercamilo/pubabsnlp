From Croatian Roma to 1000 Genomes: The Story of the <i>CYP2D6</i> Gene Promoter and Enhancer SNPs.
The <i>CYP2D6</i> gene encodes an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ~20% of clinically prescribed drugs. In this study, 18 SNPs from the enhancer and promoter regions of <i>CYP2D6</i> in 323 Roma from Croatia were genotyped, to find out whether the demographic history of Roma affected the distribution of the studied SNPs and their linkage disequilibrium (LD) values, with the major SNPs defining the <i>CYP2D6</i> star alleles. No differences were found between the three Roma groups in allele and genotype frequencies. The distribution of LD values of Roma was compared with LD values of European and Asian populations. Regulatory <i>CYP2D6</i> SNPs (rs5758550, rs28624811, rs1080985 and rs1080983) showed similar distribution and the highest LDs with rs16947 from the gene-coding region in all populations. In the promoter region, a complete LD between rs1080989 and rs28588594, and between rs1080983 and rs28624811, was found in Croatian Roma and investigated populations from 1000 genomes. A high LD was also found between rs1080985 from the promoter and rs5758550 from the enhancer region. SNP rs28735595 from the gene promoter region had the highest LD, with two gene region SNPs, rs1058164 and rs1135840. To conclude, the Croatian Roma population shows an LD pattern of the <i>CYP2D6</i> gene region similar to the 1000 Genomes European and Asian populations.
