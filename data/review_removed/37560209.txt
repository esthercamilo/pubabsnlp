Pharmaco-genetic analysis of <i>CYP1A1</i> and <i>RGS4</i> variants and its impact on response to olanzapine and risperidone in Indian schizophrenic cohort.
Genetic variations contribute significantly to inter-individual responses to drugs and side effects. Pharmacogenomics has the potential to be utilized as a tool in disorders like schizophrenia with a high degree of genetic inheritance, although data on pharmacogenomics of schizophrenia are limited. Olanzapine and risperidone are the frequently used anti-psychotic drugs used in clinics. Studies have observed the variability in the response of both drugs in schizophrenic individuals. Considering the pharmacogenomics importance of both drugs, we aim to examine the cytochrome P 4501A1 (CYP1A1) and regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) variants and their metabolizing status in 94 schizophrenic individuals of Indian descent.
