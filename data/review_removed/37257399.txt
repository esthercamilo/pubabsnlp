CTDN (Convolutional Temporal Based Deep- Neural Network): An Improvised Stacked Hybrid Computational Approach for Anticancer Drug Response Prediction.
The characterization of drug - metabolizing enzymes is a significant problem for customized therapy. It is important to choose the right drugs for cancer victims, and the ability to forecast how those drugs will react is usually based on the available information, genetic sequence, and structural properties. To the finest of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate optimization algorithms for selection of features and pharmacogenetics categorization using classification methods based on a successful evolutionary algorithm using datasets from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC). The study proposes the uses of Firefly and Grey Wolf Optimization techniques for feature extraction, while comparing the traditional Machine Learning (ML), ensemble ML and Stacking Algorithm with the proposed Convolutional Temporal Deep Neural Network or CTDN. With the potential to increase efficiency from the suggested intelligible classifier model for a suggestive chemotherapeutic drugs response prediction, our study is important in particular for selecting an acceptable feature selection method. The comparison analysis demonstrates that the proposed model not only surpasses the prior state-of-the-art methods, but also uses Grey Wolf and Fire Fly Optimization to lessen multicollinearity and overfitting.
