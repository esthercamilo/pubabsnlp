Pharmacogenomics-Guided Pharmacotherapy in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Disorder Affected by Treatment-Resistant Depressive Episodes: A Long-Term Follow-Up Study.
Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) reduces affected patients' quality of life and leads to important social health care costs. Pharmacogenomics-guided treatment (PGT) may be effective in the cure of TRD. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical changes after PGT in patients with TRD (two or more recent failed psychopharmacological trials) affected by bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to a control group with treatment as usual (TAU). We based the PGT on assessing different gene polymorphisms involved in the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs. We analyzed, with a repeated-measure ANOVA, the changes between the baseline and a 6 month follow-up of the efficacy index assessed through the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, and depressive symptoms through the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The PGT sample included 53 patients (26 BD and 27 MDD), and the TAU group included 52 patients (31 BD and 21 MDD). We found a significant within-subject effect of treatment time on symptoms and efficacy index for the whole sample, with significant improvements in the efficacy index (F = 8.544; partial η² = 0.077, <i>p</i> < 0.004) and clinical global impression of severity of illness (F = 6.818; partial η² = 0.062, <i>p</i> < 0.01) in the PGT vs. the TAU group. We also found a significantly better follow-up response (χ² = 5.479; <i>p</i> = 0.019) and remission (χ² = 10.351; <i>p</i> = 0.001) rates in the PGT vs. the TAU group. PGT may be an important option for the long-term treatment of patients with TRD affected by mood disorders, providing information that can better define drug treatment strategies and increase therapeutic improvement.
