Attitudes of healthy volunteers to genetic testing in phase 1 clinical trials.
<b>Background:</b> Genetic testing in clinical trials introduces several ethical and logistical issues to discuss with potential participants when taking informed consent. The aim of this study was to explore the attitudes of healthy volunteers in phase 1 studies to the topics of genetic security, genetic privacy and incidental genetic findings. <b>Methods:</b> Healthy volunteers presenting for screening appointments at a phase 1 clinical trial unit (CMAX Clinical Research, Adelaide, Australia) took an anonymous paper survey about genetic testing. <b>Results:</b> There were 275 respondents to the survey. The mean age was 27 years (range 18-73); 54% were male and 53% were of North/Western European ethnicity. Just over half the healthy volunteers thought genetic security (56%) and genetic privacy (57%) were "important" or "very important". However, the security of their genetic information was ranked less important than other personal information, including mobile phone number, internet browser search history and email address. Two-thirds of respondents would trade genetic privacy for re-identifiability if information relevant to their health were discovered by genetic testing. Healthy volunteers favoured the return of incidental genetic findings (90% indicated this was "important" or "very important"). A level of risk (10 to 90%) for developing a serious medical condition that would "trigger" the return of incidental genetic findings to participants was not identified. <b>Conclusions:</b> Healthy volunteers screening for phase 1 clinical trials have mixed views about the importance of genetic security and genetic privacy, but they strongly favour the return of incidental genetic findings that could affect their health. These issues should be discussed with potential participants during informed consent for phase 1 clinical trials with genetic testing.
