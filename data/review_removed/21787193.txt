Clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics: a nonrepresentative explorative survey to participants of WorldPharma 2010.
Despite the fast-growing literature and the emerging support from regulatory drug agencies, the translation of pharmacogenetics (PGx) into the clinic is still rather limited; it seems that many existing challenges are yet to be overcome prior to an extensive adoption of PGx-based diagnostics. This article describes the results of an explorative nonrepresentative survey that attempted to evaluate the perceived status quo of, and the obstacles facing, PGx implementation in clinical practice in countries with emerging and developing economies versus countries with advanced economies. This study is a useful starting point to help gain better insight into the international, rather than merely the regional, barriers facing the lag in PGx implementation in the clinic. A more transparent picture about these priorities can be constructed through conducting a similar study on a more representative sample of respondents/participants.
