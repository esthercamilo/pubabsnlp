Pharmacogenomic prescribing opportunities in percutaneous coronary intervention and bone marrow transplant patients.
<b>Aim:</b> To evaluate the potential impact of preemptive multigene pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing on medication prescribing in real-world clinical settings. <b>Patients & methods:</b> Prescription frequencies for 65 medications with actionable PGx recommendations were collected in 215 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and 131 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) patients. A simulation projected the number of PGx-guided prescribing opportunities. <b>Results:</b> In PCI and allo-HCT patients, respectively, 66.5 and 90.1% were prescribed at least one medication with actionable PGx prescribing recommendations. Simulations projected 26.5 and 41.2 total PGx-guided prescribing opportunities per 100 PCI and allo-HCT patients, respectively, if multigene PGx results were available. <b>Conclusion:</b> A multigene PGx testing strategy offers potential to optimize medication prescribing beyond clopidogrel and tacrolimus in PCI and allo-HCT patients.
