Individualized Protease Inhibitor Monotherapy: The Role of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacogenetics in an Aged and Heavily Treated HIV-Infected Patient.
Antiretroviral therapy has changed the history of HIV infection from a lethal disease to a chronic infection, with the emergence of long-term adverse effects. Herein we present a case of a heavily treated HIV-infected man in whom antiretroviral toxicity had been observed. The lopinavir/ritonavir plasma concentrations at standard doses were significantly above the recommended levels. Pharmacogenetic analysis revealed a polymorphism in the DRD3 gene associated with a decrease in the rate of drug metabolism. Additionally, the patient's low body mass index could have contributed to a greater degree of patient exposure to the drug. After the withdrawal of tenofovir disoproxil and the establishment of individualized protease inhibitor monotherapy at reduced doses, a decrease in the intensity of adverse events was observed, while the clinical outcomes were maintained. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenetic analysis was shown to be a tool of huge interest for the management and durability of antiretroviral therapy.
