Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Induces Divergent Dynamic Patterns in CYP3A5: A Microsecond Scale Biomolecular Simulation of Variants Identified in Sub-Saharan African Populations.
Pharmacogenomics aims to reveal variants associated with drug response phenotypes. Genes whose roles involve the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs, are highly polymorphic between populations. High coverage whole genome sequencing showed that a large proportion of the variants for these genes are rare in African populations. This study investigated the impact of such variants on protein structure to assess their functional importance. We used genetic data of <i>CYP3A5</i> from 458 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa to conduct a structural bioinformatics analysis. Five missense variants were modeled and microsecond scale molecular dynamics simulations were conducted for each, as well as for the CYP3A5 wildtype and the Y53C variant, which has a known deleterious impact on enzyme activity. The binding of ritonavir and artemether to CYP3A5 variant structures was also evaluated. Our results showed different conformational characteristics between all the variants. No significant structural changes were noticed. However, the genetic variability seemed to act on the plasticity of the protein. The impact on drug binding might be drug dependant. We concluded that rare variants hold relevance in determining the pharmacogenomics properties of populations. This could have a significant impact on precision medicine applications in sub-Saharan Africa.
