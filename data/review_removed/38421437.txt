The polymorphisms of candidate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genes and their pharmacogenetic impacts on the effectiveness of risperidone maintenance therapy among Saudi children with autism.
Antipsychotics, including risperidone (RIS), are frequently indicated for various autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifestations; however, "actionable" PGx testing in psychiatry regarding antipsychotic dosing and selection has limited applications in routine clinical practice because of the lack of standard guidelines, mostly due to the inconsistency and scarcity of genetic variant data. The current study is aimed at examining the association of RIS effectiveness, according to ABC-CV and CGI indexes, with relevant pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) genes.
