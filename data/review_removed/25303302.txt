Pharmacogenetics of erectile dysfunction: navigating into uncharted waters.
Sildenafil and other PDE-5 inhibitors have revolutionized erectile dysfunction (ED) treatment. However, a significant number of patients do not respond or present adverse reactions to these drugs. While genetic polymorphisms may underlie this phenomenon, very little research has been undertaken in this research field. Most of the current knowledge is based on sildenafil, thus almost completely ignoring other important pharmacological therapies. Currently, the most promising genes with pharmacogenetic implications in ED are related to the nitric oxide and cGMP pathway, although other genes are likely to affect the responsiveness to treatment of ED. Nevertheless, the small number of studies available opens the possibility of further exploring other genes and phenotypes related to ED. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the genes being tested for their pharmacogenetic relevance in the therapy of ED.
