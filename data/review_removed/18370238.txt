From SNPs to functional studies in cardiovascular pharmacogenomics.
Functional studies can be utilized to give importance/relevance to clinical associations. Once a clinical genetic or pharmacogenetic association is found, molecular studies can be utilized to explore the mechanism for the association. By employing cells in culture or transgenic mice modified with specific variant genes or sequence polymorphisms of interest, pathophysiological processes and response to pharmacological agents may be tested under conditions that are not approachable in human patients. These mechanistic studies may be particularly important when it comes to pharmacogenetic associations by providing significant, clinically relevant insights into the variable responses patients show to drug therapy.
