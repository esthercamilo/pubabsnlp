Effects of aripiprazole on circadian prolactin secretion related to pharmacogenetics in healthy volunteers.
Aripiprazole treatment in schizophrenic patients was previously associated with lower or normalized prolactin levels. Genetic variants in cytochrome P450 (CYP) (CYP2D6), dopamine receptor (DRD2, DRD3) and serotonin receptor (HTR2A, HTR2C) genes were previously associated with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinaemia. Our aim was to evaluate whether aripiprazole affects prolactin secretion and its relationship with pharmacogenetics. Thirty-one healthy volunteers receiving a 10-mg single oral dose of aripiprazole were genotyped for 12 polymorphisms in CYP2D6, DRD2, DRD3, HTR2A and HTR2C genes by qPCR. Aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole plasma concentrations were measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Prolactin concentrations of the 31 volunteers taking aripiprazole and 12 volunteers receiving ibuprofen were determined by ELISA. Prolactin concentrations after ibuprofen intake were considered as control, since it is known to cause no effect. Prolactin concentrations were slightly higher in the aripiprazole group compared to the ibuprofen group. All prolactin pharmacokinetic parameters were higher in females than in males. CYP2D6 poor and intermediate metabolizers had notably higher prolactin C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-12</sub> than normal and ultrarapid metabolizers. The DRD3 rs6280 polymorphism affected prolactin levels: volunteers carrying Ser/Ser genotype had significantly lower prolactin levels than volunteers carrying the Gly allele. Furthermore, HTR2C rs3813929 C/C homozygotes had significantly lower prolactin levels than T allele carriers. Nevertheless, aripiprazole did increase prolactin levels compared to ibuprofen.
