Pharmacogenomic studies of hypertension: paving the way for personalized antihypertensive treatment.
Increasing clinical evidence supports the implementation of genotyping for anti-hypertensive drug dosing and selection. Despite robust evidence gleaned from clinical trials, the translation of genotype guided therapy into clinical practice faces significant challenges. Challenges to implementation include the small effect size of individual variants and the polygenetic nature of antihypertensive drug response, a lack of expert consensus on dosing guidelines even without genetic information, and proper definition of major antihypertensive drug toxicities. Balancing clinical benefit with cost, while overcoming these challenges, remains crucial.
