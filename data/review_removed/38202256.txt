Unraveling Catechol-O-Methyltransferase rs4680 SNP's Role in Patients' Response to Tramadol and Its Adverse Effects: A Pharmacogenetics Insight into Postoperative Pain Management.
Effective postoperative pain management is essential for patient well-being and an efficient healthcare system. Variations in the Catechol O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene, specifically rs4680, play a crucial role in pain perception and opioid response. This study seeks to elucidate the impact of rs4680 polymorphism on tramadol efficacy and adverse reactions in post-surgical patients. We performed an uncontrolled cohort pharmacogenetics study in which participants underwent postoperative tramadol administration. The frequencies of rs4680 alleles were determined and the association between rs4680 genotypes and the efficacy of tramadol analgesic as pain relief, measured by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), was analyzed. Secondary outcomes included tramadol-induced sedation levels, opioid-induced nausea and vomiting, and other adverse effects of tramadol. Data analysis, using IBM SPSS Statistics 23, focused on pain and side effect differences across genotypes, with statistical significance set to <i>p</i> â‰¤ 0.05. The COMT (rs4680) genotype distribution exhibited a 'G' allele frequency of 41.5% and an 'A' allele frequency of 58.5%, with the AA genotype present in 44% of individuals, adhering to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<i>p</i> = 0.788). Patients with the AA genotype reported lower pain scores post-tramadol administration across all times examined (<i>p</i> < 0.001), but also experienced statistically significant (<i>p</i> < 0.001) higher incidences of tramadol-induced nausea, vomiting, and sedation. However, GG genotype individuals experienced poor pain relief from tramadol, requiring more supplemental analgesia. These significant findings underscore the critical role of COMT rs4680 polymorphism in response to tramadol and the necessity of a personalized approach to postoperative pain management.
