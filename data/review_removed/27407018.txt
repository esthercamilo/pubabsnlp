Effects of SLC22A1 Polymorphisms on Metformin-Induced Reductions in Adiposity and Metformin Pharmacokinetics in Obese Children With Insulin Resistance.
Steady-state population pharmacokinetics of a noncommercial immediate-release metformin (hydrochloride) drug product were characterized in 28 severely obese children with insulin resistance. The concentration-time profiles with double peaks were well described by a 1-compartment model with 2 absorption sites. Mean population apparent clearance (CL/F) was 68.1 L/h, and mean apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 28.8 L. Body weight was a covariate of CL/F and V/F. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was a significant covariate of CL/F (P < .001). SLC22A1 genotype did not significantly affect metformin pharmacokinetics. The response to 6 months of metformin treatment (HbA<sub>1c</sub> , homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, fasting insulin, and glucose changes) did not differ between SLC22A1 wild-type subjects and carriers of presumably low-activity SLC22A1 alleles. However, SLC22A1 variant carriers had smaller reductions in percentage of total trunk fat after metformin therapy, although the percentage reduction in trunk fat was small. The median % change in trunk fat was -2.20% (-9.00% to 0.900%) and -1.20% (-2.40% to 7.30%) for the SLC22A1 wild-type subjects and variant carriers, respectively. Future study is needed to evaluate the effects of SLC22A1 polymorphisms on metformin-mediated weight reduction in obese children.
