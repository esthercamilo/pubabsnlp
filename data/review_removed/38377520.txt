Impact of Cytochrome P450 Genetic Variation on Patient-Reported Symptom Improvement and Side Effects Among Children and Adolescents Treated with Fluoxetine.
<b><i>Background:</i></b> Clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as a first-line pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in children and adolescents. However, response and tolerability to fluoxetine varies from child to child, which may in part, be a result of interindividual differences in fluoxetine metabolism. In this study, we examined whether genotype-predicted activity scores of cytochrome P450 enzymes were associated with patient-reported symptom improvement and side effects in children and adolescents treated with fluoxetine. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Ninety children and adolescents aged 7-18 with a MDD or OCD diagnosis and a history of fluoxetine treatment were recruited from Western Canada. For each participant, fluoxetine dose and duration information were collected, as well as questions about adherence, side effects, and symptom improvement. DNA was extracted from a saliva sample and genotyped for <i>CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4,</i> and <i>CYP3A5</i>. Logistic regression models were fitted to assess the impact of activity scores on symptom improvement and side effects. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Increased CYP2D6 activity score was significantly associated with reduced odds of symptom improvement (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.23-0.91, <i>p</i> = 0.028) as well as a trend association with reduced side effects (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.22-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.072), after adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, dose, duration, adherence, and activity scores of the other assessed CYP enzymes. No associations with symptom improvement or side effects were detected for the other CYP enzymes examined. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Our results suggest that an increase in the genotype-predicted CYP2D6 activity score was associated with a decrease in the odds of reporting symptom improvement among children and adolescents treated with fluoxetine. These findings will contribute to future updates of pharmacogenetic-based SSRI prescribing guidelines and if replicated, could inform fluoxetine treatment in children and adolescents with MDD or OCD. <b><i>Clinical Trial Registration:</i></b> NCT04797364.
