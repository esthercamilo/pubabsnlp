Integration of Germline Pharmacogenetics Into a Tumor Sequencing Program.
Evidence-based guidelines inform treatment decisions for patients for whom germline genetic information is available. Our real-time tumor sequencing program, which makes precision treatment decisions for patients with cancer, produces matched germline information, providing a unique opportunity to efficiently implement pharmacogenetics and benefit patients.
