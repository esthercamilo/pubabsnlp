CYP2C19 poor metabolizer is associated with clinical outcome of clopidogrel therapy in acute myocardial infarction but not stable angina.
More intensive platelet suppression is required in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than in those with stable angina because of differential platelet activation between AMI and stable angina. In this context, CYP2C19 genotype leading to reduced active metabolite formation may profoundly affect the clinical outcome of clopidogrel therapy in patients with AMI compared with those with stable angina.
