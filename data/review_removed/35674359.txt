Looking at the BiG picture: incorporating bipartite graphs in drug response prediction.
The increasing number of publicly available databases containing drugs' chemical structures, their response in cell lines, and molecular profiles of the cell lines has garnered attention to the problem of drug response prediction. However, many existing methods do not fully leverage the information that is shared among cell lines and drugs with similar structure. As such, drug similarities in terms of cell line responses and chemical structures could prove to be useful in forming drug representations to improve drug response prediction accuracy.
