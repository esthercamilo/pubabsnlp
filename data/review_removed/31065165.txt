Implementation of an Active-Learning Laboratory on Pharmacogenetics.
<b>Objective.</b> To evaluate students' knowledge, confidence, and skills after implementation of an active-learning laboratory session in clinical pharmacogenetics. <b>Methods.</b> Third-year pharmacy students (n=130) participated in an active-learning laboratory session on pharmacogenetics. In the laboratory activity, students evaluated patients' pharmacogenetic profiles and documented recommendations to providers based on their findings. Students also counseled a simulated patient on the interpretation of their pharmacogenetic profile. Students' knowledge and confidence were assessed before a lecture on clinical pharmacogenetics, after the lecture, and then after the laboratory activity. The assessment included 10 knowledge-based questions and five confidence questions regarding clinical pharmacogenetics. An evaluation of the laboratory activity was completed after the session. <b>Results.</b> On average, students correctly answered 70.3% of the knowledge-based questions before the lecture, 82.8% after the lecture, and 88.7% after the laboratory session. Additionally, students' confidence improved in each of the five areas assessed. Based on evaluations (response rate: 98.5%), students found that the laboratory activity contributed to their professional development, was taught at an appropriate level for their understanding, and was relevant to pharmacy practice. <b>Conclusion.</b> An active-learning laboratory session to teach pharmacy students about clinical pharmacogenetics improved students' knowledge, confidence, and skills.
