Prevalence of predicted gene-drug interactions for antidepressants in the treatment of major depressive disorder in the Precision Medicine in Mental Health Care Study.
Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing is a potentially important, but understudied approach to precision medicine that could improve prescribing practices for antidepressants (ADs) in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Thus, it is important to understand the scope of its potential impact and to identify patients who may benefit most from PGx-guided care.
