[Practical aspects of using donepezil in the treatment of dementia].
Donepezil is the most commonly used drug of the group of cholinesterase inhibitors. It is recommended for tretament of Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil is also used to treat dementia in Lewy body disease, Parkinson's disease with dementia, and vascular dementia. In Russia, donepezil is not used as often, which is facilitated by the concern of doctors about the possibility of serious side-effects. Clinical studies demonstrate the safety and good tolerability of donepezil. Our study included 62 patients with dementia due to various neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease, Parkinson's disease with dementia). Thirty-seven patients (59.7%) started to receive donepezil. Side-effects, including bradycardia, hypertension, aggressive behavior, increased tremor, were observed in 7 patients (18.9%). There was no correlation between the development of side-effects and polymorphisms of the <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>MDR1</i> genes.
