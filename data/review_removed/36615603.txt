Exploration of Flavonoids as Lead Compounds against Ewing Sarcoma through Molecular Docking, Pharmacogenomics Analysis, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations.
Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a highly malignant carcinoma prevalent in children and most frequent in the second decade of life. It mostly occurs due to t(11;22) (q24;q12) translocation. This translocation encodes the oncogenic fusion protein EWS/FLI (Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor), which acts as an aberrant transcription factor to deregulate target genes essential for cancer. Traditionally, flavonoids from plants have been investigated against viral and cancerous diseases and have shown some promising results to combat these disorders. In the current study, representative flavonoid compounds from various subclasses are selected and used to disrupt the RNA-binding motif of EWS, which is required for EWS/FLI fusion. By blocking the RNA-binding motif of EWS, it might be possible to combat ES. Therefore, molecular docking experiments validated the binding interaction patterns and structural behaviors of screened flavonoid compounds within the active region of the Ewing sarcoma protein (EWS). Furthermore, pharmacogenomics analysis was used to investigate potential drug interactions with Ewing sarcoma-associated genes. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate the stability of the best selected docked complexes. Taken together, daidzein, kaempferol, and genistein exhibited a result comparable to ifosfamide in the proposed in silico study and can be further analyzed as possible candidate compounds in biological in vitro studies against ES.
