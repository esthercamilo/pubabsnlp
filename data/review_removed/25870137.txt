Pharmacogenetic Markers of Drug Efficacy and Toxicity.
The action of a drug is dictated by its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties, both of which can vary in different individuals because of environmental and genetic factors. Pharmacogenetics, the study of genetic factors determining drug response, has the potential to improve clinical outcomes through targeting therapies, individualizing dosing, preventing adverse drug reactions, and potentially rescuing previously failed therapies. Although there have been significant advances in pharmacogenetics over the last decade, only a few have been translated into clinical practice. However, with new rapid genotyping technologies, regulatory modernization, novel clinical trial designs, systems approaches, and integration of pharmacogenetic data into decision support systems, there is hope that pharmacogenetics, as an important component of the overall drive towards personalized medicine, will advance more quickly in the future. There will continue to be a need for collaboration between centers all over the world, and multisector working, capitalizing on the current data revolution.
