Pharmacogenomics Implementation Training Improves Self-Efficacy and Competency to Drive Adoption in Clinical Practice.
<b>Background:</b> Administration of pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing in clinical practice has been suboptimal, presumably due to lack of PGx education. Here, we aim to evaluate the standpoint of PGx testing among a diverse group of healthcare professionals (HCPs) through conducting surveys before and after training. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Training modules were designed to cover three key learning objectives and deployed in five sections. A pre- and post-training survey questionnaire was used to evaluate participants' self-assessments on employing PGx in clinical practice. <b>Results and Conclusion:</b> Out of all enrollments, 102 survey responses were collected. Overall, respondents agree on the benefits of PGx testing, but have inadequate self-efficacy and competency in utilizing PGx data. Our results show that a 90Â min long training significantly improves these, and could lead to greater anticipation of PGx adoption.
