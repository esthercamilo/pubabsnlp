Brain-penetrating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and cognitive change in patients with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
Controversy over benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) for treatment of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) led to this alternative investigational approach by the employment of pharmacogenetic methods, correlating the cognitive change of patients with late-onset AD with the presence of common ACE gene promoter polymorphisms, and stratifying the sample in groups of patients who responded or not to the brain-penetrating ACEIs Captopril or Perindopril. A trend was found for treatment with brain-penetrating ACEIs to slow cognitive decline in AD patients with the haplotype rs1800764 (CC): rs4291 (TT) (p = 0.024), and also non-significantly for independent carriers of rs1800764 or rs4291.
