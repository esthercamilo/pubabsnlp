Pharmacogenomics in the UK National Health Service: opportunities and challenges.
Despite increasing interest in pharmacogenomics, and the potential benefits to improve patient care, implementation into clinical practice has not been widespread. Recently, there has been a drive to implement genomic medicine into the UK National Health Service (NHS), largely spurred on by the success of the 100,000 Genomes Project. The UK Pharmacogenetics and Stratified Medicine Network, NHS England and Genomics England invited experts from academia, the healthcare sector, industry and patient representatives to come together to discuss the opportunities and challenges of implementing pharmacogenomics into the NHS. This report highlights the discussions of the workshop to provide an overview of the issues that need to be considered to enable pharmacogenomic medicine to become mainstream within the NHS.
