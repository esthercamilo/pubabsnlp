The Pharmacogenetics of Efavirenz Metabolism in Children: The Potential Genetic and Medical Contributions to Child Development in the Context of Long-Term ARV Treatment.
Efavirenz (EFV) is a well-known, effective anti-retroviral drug long used in first-line treatment for children and adults with HIV and HIV/AIDS. Due to its narrow window of effective concentrations, between 1 and 4 Î¼g/mL, and neurological side effects at supratherapeutic levels, several investigations into the pharmacokinetics of the drug and its genetic underpinnings have been carried out, primarily with adult samples. A number of studies, however, have examined the genetic influences on the metabolism of EFV in children. Their primary goal has been to shed light on issues of appropriate pediatric dosing, as well as the manifestation of neurotoxic effects of EFV in some children. Although EFV is currently being phased out of use for the treatment of both adults and children, we share this line of research to highlight an important aspect of medical treatment that is relevant to understanding the development of children diagnosed with HIV.
