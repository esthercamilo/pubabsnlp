The genomic landscape of <i>CYP2D6</i> variation in the Indian population.
<b>Aim:</b> The <i>CYP2D6</i> gene is highly polymorphic, causing large interindividual variability in the metabolism of several clinically important drugs. <b>Materials & methods:</b> The authors investigated the diversity and distribution of <i>CYP2D6</i> alleles in Indians using whole genome sequences (N = 1518). Functional consequences were assessed using pathogenicity scores and molecular dynamics simulations. <b>Results:</b> The analysis revealed population-specific <i>CYP2D6</i> alleles (<i>*86</i>, <i>*7</i>, <i>*111</i>, <i>*112</i>, <i>*113</i>, <i>*99</i>) and remarkable differences in variant and phenotype frequencies with global populations. The authors observed that one in three Indians could benefit from a dose alteration for psychiatric drugs with accurate <i>CYP2D6</i> phenotyping. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed large conformational fluctuations, confirming the predicted reduced function of <i>*86</i> and <i>*113</i> alleles. <b>Conclusion:</b> The findings emphasize the utility of comprehensive <i>CYP2D6</i> profiling for aiding precision public health.
