Effects of <i>CYP3A5</i> Genotype on Tacrolimus Pharmacokinetics and Graft-versus-Host Disease Incidence in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.
Tacrolimus (Tac) is pivotal in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). It has been reported that genetic factors, including <i>CYP3A5</i>*<i>3</i> and <i>CYP3A4*</i>22 polymorphisms, have an impact on Tac metabolism, dose requirement, and response to Tac. There is limited information regarding this topic in alloHSCT. The <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype and a low Tac trough concentration/dose ratio (Tac C<sub>0</sub>/D ratio) can be used to identify fast metabolizers and predict the required Tac dose to achieve target concentrations earlier. We examined 62 Caucasian alloHSCT recipients with a fast metabolizer phenotype (C<sub>0</sub>/dose ratio â‰¤ 1.5 ng/mL/mg), assessing <i>CYP3A5</i> genotypes and acute GVHD incidence. Forty-nine patients (79%) were poor metabolizers (2 copies of the variant *3 allele) and 13 (21%) were CYP3A5 expressers (<i>CYP3A5*1/*1</i> or <i>CYP3A5*1/*3</i> genotypes). CYP3A5 expressers had lower C<sub>0</sub> at 48 h (3.7 vs. 6.2 ng/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.03) and at 7 days (8.6 vs. 11.4 ng/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.04) after Tac initiation, tended to take longer to reach Tac therapeutic range (11.8 vs. 8.9 days, <i>p</i> = 0.16), and had higher incidence of both global (92.3% vs. 38.8%, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and grade II-IV acute GVHD (61.5% vs. 24.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.008). These results support the adoption of preemptive pharmacogenetic testing to better predict individual Tac initial dose, helping to achieve the therapeutic range and reducing the risk of acute GVHD earlier.
