Genome-wide association and pharmacological profiling of 29 anticancer agents using lymphoblastoid cell lines.
Association mapping with lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) is a promising approach in pharmacogenomics research, and in the current study we utilized LCLs to perform association mapping for 29 chemotherapy drugs.
