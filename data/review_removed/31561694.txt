From Individualized to Personalized Medicine in Diabetes: An Expert Overview.
Personalized medicine is an individualized and stratified approach to the management of a disease. Personalized medicine can reform the prevention, prediction, and management of diabetes. Use of genetic information in polygenic and monogenic forms of diabetes can help to identify genetic variants and reclassify patients into pathophysiological subgroups. Targeted diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions can be defined for these groups for effective management of diabetes. Pharmacogenetics combines genotypic and phenotypic factors to develop personalized care in various pathophysiological subgroups of persons with diabetes. Personalized medicine finds wider utility in monogenic (especially Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) and Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus [NDM]) than in polygenic, diabetes. The most frequently mutated genes in MODY include HNF1A and HNF3A. the common genes responsible for NDM include KCNJ11 and ABCC8 (SUR) genes. These genes influence various aspects of glucose metabolism such as Î²-cell K-ATP channel modulation, production of insulin and development of pancreas. The Madras Diabetes Research Foundation has fostered research in personalized medicine for diabetes based upon genetic information and has developed a national registry for neonatal diabetes and other monogenic form of diabetes.
