Pharmacogenetic testing through the direct-to-consumer genetic testing company 23andMe.
Rapid advances in scientific research have led to an increase in public awareness of genetic testing and pharmacogenetics.

Here, we evaluate the clinical relevance of pharmacogenetic tests reported by 23andMe in their UK tests.
