Projected impact of pharmacogenomic testing on medications beyond antiplatelet therapy in percutaneous coronary intervention patients.
<b>Aim:</b><i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping is used to guide antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This study evaluated the potential impact of <i>CYP2C19</i> and multigene pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing on medications beyond antiplatelet therapy in a real-world cohort of PCI patients that underwent <i>CYP2C19</i> testing. <b>MethodologyÂ & results:</b> Multiple medications with actionable PGx recommendations, including proton pump inhibitors, antidepressants and opioids, were commonly prescribed. Approximately 50% received a CYP2C19 metabolized medication beyond clopidogrel and 7% met criteria for a <i>CYP2C19</i> genotype-guided intervention. A simulation analysis projected that 17.5 PGx-guided medication interventions per 100 PCI patients could have been made if multigene PGx results were available. <b>Conclusion:</b> This suggests that <i>CYP2C19</i> and multigene PGx results could be used to optimize medication prescribing beyond antiplatelet therapy in PCI patients.
