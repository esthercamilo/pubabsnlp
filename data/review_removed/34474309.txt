Benchmarking blockchain-based gene-drug interaction data sharing methods: A case study from the iDASH 2019 secure genome analysis competition blockchain track.
Blockchain distributed ledger technology is just starting to be adopted in genomics and healthcare applications. Despite its increased prevalence in biomedical research applications, skepticism regarding the practicality of blockchain technology for real-world problems is still strong and there are few implementations beyond proof-of-concept. We focus on benchmarking blockchain strategies applied to distributed methods for sharing records of gene-drug interactions. We expect this type of sharing will expedite personalized medicine.
