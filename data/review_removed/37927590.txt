Pharmacogenomics in clinical trials: an overview.
With the trend towards promoting personalised medicine (PM), the application of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics (PGx) is of growing importance. For the purposes of clinical trials, the inclusion of PGx is an additional tool that should be considered for improving our knowledge about the effectiveness and safety of new drugs. A search of available clinical trials containing pharmacogenetic and PGx information was conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov. The results show there has been an increase in the number of trials containing PGx information since the 2000Â s, with particular relevance in the areas of Oncology (28.43%) and Mental Health (10.66%). Most of the clinical trials focus on treatment as their primary purpose. In those clinical trials entries where the specific genes considered for study are detailed, the most frequently explored genes are <i>CYP2D6</i> (especially in Mental Health and Pain), <i>CYP2C9</i> (in Hematology), <i>CYP2C19</i> (in Cardiology and Mental Health) and <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>CYP3A5</i> (particularly prominent in Transplantation and Cardiology), among others. Researchers and clinicans should be trained in pharmacogenetics and PGx in order to be able to make a proper interpretation of this data, contributing to better prescribing decisions and an improvement in patients' care, which would lead to the performance of PM.
