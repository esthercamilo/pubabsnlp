[Genotyping and treatment modification in patients with phenylketonuria: an introduction to pharmacogenomics].
Phenylketonuria is the most common inborn error of metabolism. The disease is caused by mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, decreasing or completely abolishing the activity of the encoded enzyme. Treatment consists in maintaining low blood phenylalanine concentration. Untreated patients develop mental retardation. Use of tetrahydrobiopterin is a new, alternative treatment method, effective in some phenylketonuria-patients. Because the dietary treatment becomes less restrictive in such patients, quality of life rises in them substantially. Phenylketonuria-causing mutations strictly determine susceptibility to tetrahydrobiopterin in a given patient.
