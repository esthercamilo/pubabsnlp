Effect of <i>CYP2C9 *11/*11</i> genotype on initial and long-term warfarin dose requirement and therapeutic response.
The warfarin dose requirement and therapeutic response of a 42-year-old African-American male with genotype <i>CYP2C9 *11/*11, VKORC1 -1639GG</i> and <i>CYP4F2 433Val/Val</i> anticoagulated for ischemic stroke is described herein. Warfarin was dosed according to the institution's personalized medicine program recommendations of a 10 mg mini-load dose, followed by dose decreases to 4-6 mg/day through discharge. Stable international normalized ratio was achieved after eight doses, with good overall long-term maintenance of therapeutic international normalized ratio over several years with warfarin doses of 3.1-4.3 mg/day. This case report sheds further light on the clinical impact of <i>CYP2C9 *11/*11</i> on warfarin dose requirements, short- and long-term treatment response and practical considerations for warfarin management in suspected carriers of rare variant <i>CYP2C9</i> alleles.
