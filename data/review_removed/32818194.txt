Prescriber Attitudes Toward Implementation of Pharmacogenomic Testing in a Family Medicine Residency Program.
Few qualitative studies have explored the attitude of prescribers towards the implementation of pharmacogenomic testing in the family medicine (FM) setting, and none among FM residents. The purpose of this study was to describe the level of engagement and interest in the implementation of pharmacogenomic education and testing in an FM clinic within a residency program.
