Comprehensive analysis of important pharmacogenes in Koreans using the DMET™ platform.
Genetic polymorphisms of enzymes and transporters associated with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) of drugs are one of the major factors that contribute to interindividual variations in drug response. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the pharmacogenetic profiles of the Korean population using the Affymetrix Drug Metabolizing Enzyme and Transporters (DMET™) platform. A total of 1,012 whole blood samples collected from Korean subjects were genotyped using the DMET™ plus microarray. In total, 1,785 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for 231 ADME genes were identified. The genotype and phenotype of 13 clinically important ADME genes implemented in the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines were compared among different ethnic groups. Overall, the genotype frequencies of the Korean population were similar to those of the East Asian population. Several genes, notably <i>CYP2C19</i> and <i>VKORC1</i>, showed marked differences in Koreans compared to Europeans (EURs) or Africans (AFRs). The percentage of CYP2C19 poor metabolizers was 15% in Koreans and less than 3% in EURs or AFRs. The frequencies of causative SNPs of the <i>VKORC1</i> gene for the low warfarin dose phenotype were 90%, 60%, and 10% in Koreans, EURs and AFRs, respectively. Our findings can be utilized for optimal pharmacotherapy in Korean patients.
