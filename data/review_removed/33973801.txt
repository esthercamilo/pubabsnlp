Deliberations about clinical pharmacogenetic testing in pediatric oncology.
This article summarizes the background, content and outcomes of a special meeting that was convened among oncologists and scientists to discuss the role of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing in pediatric clinical oncology practice. This meeting provided an opportunity for what the lead author (AM Issa) refers to as the 'voice of the clinician' dynamic to be amplified in order to better understand how personalized or precision medicine applications such as PGx testing are adopted and incorporated into clinical settings and what we can learn from the experiences of current and ongoing implementation PGx approaches to further the implementation of precision medicine applications in real-world environments. Group dynamics and clinical experience with PGx testing and return of results shaped the discussion.
