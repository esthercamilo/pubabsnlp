Effects of oxycodone pharmacogenetics on postoperative analgesia and related clinical outcomes in children: a pilot prospective study.
<b>Background:</b> Variability in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxycodone in children undergoing surgery could be due to genetic polymorphisms. <b>Materials & methods:</b> The authors studied the association between clinical outcomes and pharmacogenes in children undergoing major surgery. A total of 89 children (35 undergoing pectus excavatum repair and 54 undergoing spinal fusion) were recruited. <b>Results:</b> <i>OPRM1</i> SNP rs6902403 showed an association with maximum pain score and total morphine equivalent dose (p < 0.05). Other polymorphisms in <i>OPRM1</i> SNP, <i>PXR</i>, <i>COMT</i> and <i>ABCB1</i> were also shown to be associated with average morphine equivalent dose, length of hospital stay and maximum surgical pain (p < 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study demonstrates novel associations between the above pharmacogenes and oxycodone's pharmacokinetics as well as postoperative outcomes in children. <b>Clinical trial registration</b>: NCT03495388 (ClinicalTrials.gov).
