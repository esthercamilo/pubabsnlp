Pharmacogenomic Profiling of ADME Gene Variants: Current Challenges and Validation Perspectives.
In the past decades, many efforts have been made to individualize medical treatments, taking into account molecular profiles and the individual genetic background. The development of molecularly targeted drugs and immunotherapy have revolutionized medical treatments but the inter-patient variability in the anti-tumor drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics can be explained, at least in part, by genetic variations in genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (ADME) or in genes encoding drug receptors. Here, we focus on high-throughput technologies applied for PK screening for the identification of predictive biomarkers of efficacy or toxicity in cancer treatment, whose application in clinical practice could promote personalized treatments tailored on individual's genetic make-up. Pharmacogenomic tools have been implemented and the clinical utility of pharmacogenetic screening could increase safety in patients for the identification of drug metabolism-related biomarkers for a personalized medicine. Although pharmacogenomic studies were performed in adult cohorts, pharmacogenetic pediatric research has yielded promising results. Additionally, we discuss the current challenges and theoretical bases for the implementation of pharmacogenetic tests for translation in the clinical practice taking into account that pharmacogenomics platforms are discovery oriented and must open the way for the setting of robust tests suitable for daily practice.
