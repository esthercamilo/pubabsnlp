[Liquid Biopsy: Challenges and Possibilities Regarding Its Clinical Application.].
Cell-free DNA is "Fragmented DNA found in circulation in the Cell-free component of whole blood". Cell-free DNA derived from tumors is expressed as circulating tumor DNA. Examination of circulating tu- mor DNA for genetic alterations present in the tumor tissue is defined as liquid biopsy. Currently in the cancer field, Cell-free DNA or CTC (Circulating tumor cells) is the main target of "Liquid Biopsy". Acquir- ing Cell-free DNA or CTC presents little challenge because of the recent technological developments. However, we need to improve the efficiency of CTC retrieval, and we also need to establish how to culture the retrieved CTCs. For clinical applications, PGx (Pharmacogenomics) and PGt (Pharmacogenetics) fol- lowing NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) are attractive areas for new and future applications. The intro- duction of "Liquid Biopsy" to the area of clinical trials is already in progress. As an expert group, members of the JSLM (Japanese Society of Laboratory Medicine) need to indicate the presence of quality control or quality management in the area of "Liquid Biopsy". Besides these quality issues, we, as clinical pathologists, need to think about harmonizing our expertise with surgical pathologists, who have historically handled clas- sical biopsies of solid samples. The field of "Liquid Biopsy" has marked potential; however, we need to overcome various obstacles to realize this.
