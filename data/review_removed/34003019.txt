Implementation of a next-generation sequencing-based targeted approach for full-length <i>CYP3A4</i> gene sequencing.
<b>Aim:</b> To evaluate the application of next-generation sequencing-based targeted protocol for full-length <i>CYP3A4</i> gene sequencing analysis. <b>Materials & methods:</b> The developed sequencing protocol was applied to analyze human DNA samples (n = 7) obtained from tuberculosis patients admitted to the Riga East University Hospital, Center of Tuberculosis and Lung diseases. <b>Results:</b> The sequencing data quality was sufficient for the detection of already known genetic variants, as well as for identifying rare and novel variants dispersed throughout the <i>CYP3A4</i> gene with a high degree of confidence. <b>Conclusion:</b> Developed protocol can be applied in subpopulation level association studies to determine whether specific genetic variants or variant combinations from multiple regions of the <i>CYP3A4</i> gene are of clinical significance.
