AITL: Adversarial Inductive Transfer Learning with input and output space adaptation for pharmacogenomics.
The goal of pharmacogenomics is to predict drug response in patients using their single- or multi-omics data. A major challenge is that clinical data (i.e. patients) with drug response outcome is very limited, creating a need for transfer learning to bridge the gap between large pre-clinical pharmacogenomics datasets (e.g. cancer cell lines), as a source domain, and clinical datasets as a target domain. Two major discrepancies exist between pre-clinical and clinical datasets: (i) in the input space, the gene expression data due to difference in the basic biology, and (ii) in the output space, the different measures of the drug response. Therefore, training a computational model on cell lines and testing it on patients violates the i.i.d assumption that train and test data are from the same distribution.
