Genetics for the pediatric anesthesiologist: a primer on congenital malformations, pharmacogenetics, and proteomics.
Molecular genetics is the study, at the molecular level, of how genetic information is stored, inherited, and expressed and of how it influences the structure and function of cells in health and in disease. Although molecular approaches have been used for decades in the laboratory and are at the core of modern medical education, they are only now beginning to influence clinical practice. A variety of sophisticated techniques permit rapid and affordable DNA sequencing, gene expression profiling, gene cloning, gene manipulation, gene transfer, recombinant protein production, and other technologies of enormous biomedical importance. Success in genomics has spawned additional ambitious endeavors, including proteomics, pharmacogenomics, and bioinformatics. These techniques are providing new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic opportunities in all areas of medicine, including anesthesiology. With the use of molecular criteria and the diminishing cost of analytic technologies, anesthetic practice will become more individualized, and greater emphasis will be placed on the patient's genetic makeup. Both surgical and nonsurgical decisions will increasingly accommodate molecular data crucial to perioperative anesthetic management. In this article we have summarized three lectures on congenital malformations, pharmacogenetics, and proteomics presented at the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia.
