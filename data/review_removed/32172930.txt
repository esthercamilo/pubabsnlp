Variant classifications, databases and genotype-phenotype correlations.
Because CFTR gene studies now represent one of the most frequent genetic analyses routinely performed worldwide, the number of rare CFTR variants identified in various clinical situations, regularly increases. To provide appropriate diagnosis and prognosis to CF patients as well as appropriate genetic counseling to families, the clinical impact and the phenotypic spectrum of variants identified by diagnostic techniques need to be characterized. Three complementary locus specific databases, called CFTR1, CFTR2 and CFTR-France were developed to address these issues. Besides, the growing knowledge of the CF pathophysiology and the technical evolution in molecular biology allowed to identify candidate modifier genes, regulatory loci, epigenetic profiles and trans-regulators that could help to refine genotype-phenotype correlations at the individual level. These different factors may contribute to the large phenotypic variability between patients with CF, even when they carry identical CFTR variants, regarding lung function, meconium ileus susceptibility or the risk for developing CFTR-related diabetes and liver disease. Finally, the availability of new therapies that target the CFTR protein for numbers of CF patients led to the identification of 'good' and 'poor' responders, thus raising questions of pharmacogenetics factors that may influence treatment efficiency as a novel feature of the complexity of CF patients' management.
