Current and future developments in the pharmacology of asthma and COPD: ERS seminar, Naples 2022.
Pharmacological management of airway obstructive diseases is a fast-evolving field. Several advances in unravelling disease mechanisms as well as intracellular and molecular pathways of drug action have been accomplished. While the clinical translation and implementation of <i>in vitro</i> results to the bedside remains challenging, advances in comprehending the mechanisms of respiratory medication are expected to assist clinicians and scientists in identifying meaningful read-outs and designing clinical studies. This European Respiratory Society Research Seminar, held in Naples, Italy, 5-6 May 2022, focused on current and future developments of the drugs used to treat asthma and COPD; on mechanisms of drug action, steroid resistance, comorbidities and drug interactions; on prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers; on developing novel drug targets based on tissue remodelling and regeneration; and on pharmacogenomics and emerging biosimilars. Related European Medicines Agency regulations are also discussed, as well as the seminar's position on the above aspects.
