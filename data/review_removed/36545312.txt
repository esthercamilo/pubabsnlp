Effects of CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5 on clinical outcome in patients treated with ticagrelor for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: POPular Genetics sub-study.
<b>Aims:</b> To determine the clinical efficacy, adverse events and side-effect dyspnea of <i>CYP3A4*22</i> and CYP3A5 expressor status in ticagrelor treated patients. <b>Methods and results:</b> Ticagrelor treated patients from the POPular Genetics randomized controlled trial were genotyped for <i>CYP3A4*22</i> and <i>CYP3A5*3</i> alleles. Patients were divided based on their genotype. In total 1,281 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were included. <i>CYP3A4*22</i> carriers (<i>n</i> = 152) <i>versus CYP3A4*22</i> non-carrier status (<i>n</i> = 1,129) were not found to have a significant correlation with the primary thrombotic endpoint: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, definite stent thrombosis and stroke [1.3% vs. 2.5%, adjusted hazard ratio 1.81 (0.43-7.62) <i>p = 0.42</i>], or the primary bleeding endpoint: PLATO major and minor bleeding [13.2% vs. 11.3%, adjusted hazard ratio 0.93 (0.58-1.50) <i>p = 0.77</i>]. Among the <i>CYP3A4*1/*1</i> patients, CYP3A5 expressors (<i>n</i> = 196) <i>versus</i> non-expressors (<i>n</i> = 926) did not show a significant difference for the primary thrombotic [2.6% vs. 2.5%, adjusted hazard ratio 1.03 (0.39-2.71) <i>p = 0.95</i>], or the primary bleeding endpoint [12.8% vs. 10.9%, adjusted hazard ratio 1.13 (0.73-1.76) <i>p = 0.58</i>]. With respect to dyspnea, no significant difference was observed between <i>CYP3A4*22</i> carriers <i>versus CYP3A4*22</i> non-carriers [44.0% vs. 45.0%, odds ratio 1.04 (0.45-2.42) <i>p = 0.93</i>], or in the <i>CYP3A4*1/*1</i> group, CYP3A5 expressors <i>versus</i> CYP3A5 non-expressors [35.3% vs. 47.8%, odds ratio 0.60 (0.27-1.30) <i>p = 0.20</i>]. <b>Conclusion:</b> In STEMI patients treated with ticagrelor, neither the <i>CYP3A4*22</i> carriers, nor the CYP3A5 expressor status had a statistical significant effect on thrombotic and bleeding event rates nor on dyspnea. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01761786.
