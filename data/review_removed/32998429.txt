The HLA-Cw6 Dilemma: Is It Really an Outcome Predictor in Psoriasis Patients under Biologic Therapy? A Monocentric Retrospective Analysis.
HLA-Cw6 is one of the most strongly associated psoriasis susceptibility alleles. Data regarding correlation between HLA-Cw6 status and biologic treatment outcomes are divergent. The aim of our study in our cohort of psoriatic patients was to explore if the HLA-Cw6 status influences the response rate to biologic therapies at 16 and 48 weeks. One hundred and one psoriatic patients eligible for biologic therapies were enrolled. HLA-C*06 alleles were detected from their blood samples. The effectiveness of antipsoriatic treatments was reported as 90% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index reduction (PASI90). All biologics showed efficacy at week 16, without significant differences between one another. HLA-Cw6 status did not seem to affect baseline characteristics, or treatment response at week 16. At week 48, IL-12/23 and IL-17 targeting drugs were more effective on Cw6-positive patients than on Cw6-negative patients. Conversely, TNF-targeting drugs seemed to be more effective on Cw6- negative patients than on Cw6-positive patients. The HLA-Cw6 test could well deserve to be integrated into the clinical laboratory work-up supporting the choice of the correct biologic.
