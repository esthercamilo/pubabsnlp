Genetics/genomics advances to influence care for patients with chronic disease.
Rapid changes in the field of genetics/genomics are affecting the way we practice nursing. Staying current on this dynamic field is a challenge for all healthcare professionals. This article discusses genetics/genomics issues that are likely to have a strong influence on nurses who care for patients with chronic disease. Complex diseases involving the actions of genes and environment are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality. Pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics has the potential to alter the way we choose both medications and appropriate doses. Nutrigenomics promises to help us understand how diet affects gene expression and how genetic variants affect the way we use nutrients. Genetic testing can be purchased through the Internet and currently is being marketed directly to consumers. Each of these topics has present and future implications for all healthcare professionals, especially those caring for people with chronic disease.
