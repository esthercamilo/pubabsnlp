Variants in <i>COMT</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>CYP2B6,</i> and <i>ABCG2</i> Alter Quetiapine Pharmacokinetics.
Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic widely used for the treatment of schizophrenia and the depressive episodes of bipolar disorder. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of variants in relevant pharmacogenes in the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine and to exploratorily evaluate adverse drug reaction (ADR) incidence based on genetic polymorphism. Specifically, 49 healthy volunteers enrolled in two bioequivalence clinical trials were included in this study. In addition, 80 variants in 19 relevant pharmacogenes were genotyped, including cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes, catechol-O-methyl transferase (<i>COMT</i>), other enzymes (e.g., <i>UGT1A1</i> or <i>UGT1A4</i>), and transporters (e.g., <i>SLCO1B1, ABCB1</i>, or <i>ABCG2</i>). The <i>COMT</i> rs13306278 T allele was significantly related to quetiapine-increased exposure. We demonstrated the existence of quetiapine derivatives with a catechol-like structure (7,8-dihydroxi-quetiapine and 7,8-dihydroxi-N-desalkyl-quetiapine), which would be COMT metabolites and would explain quetiapine accumulation through CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 negative feedback. Moreover, CYP3A5 and <i>CYP2B6</i> phenotypes were related to quetiapine exposure variability, which confirms (for CYP3A5) and suggests (for CYP2B6) that these enzymes play an important role in quetiapine's metabolism. Finally, the <i>ABCG2</i> rs2231142 T allele was related to quetiapine accumulation. Further studies are required to confirm the clinical relevance of our findings.
