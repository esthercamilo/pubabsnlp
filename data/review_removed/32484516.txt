Scoring functions for drug-effect similarity.
The difficulty to find new drugs and bring them to the market has led to an increased interest to find new applications for known compounds. Biological samples from many disease contexts have been extensively profiled by transcriptomics, and, intuitively, this motivates to search for compounds with a reversing effect on the expression of characteristic disease genes. However, disease effects may be cell line-specific and also depend on other factors, such as genetics and environment. Transcription profile changes between healthy and diseased cells relate in complex ways to profile changes gathered from cell lines upon stimulation with a drug. Despite these differences, we expect that there will be some similarity in the gene regulatory networks at play in both situations. The challenge is to match transcriptomes for both diseases and drugs alike, even though the exact molecular pathology/pharmacogenomics may not be known.
