TRAILR1 (rs20576) and GRIA3 (rs12557782) are not associated with interferon-β response in multiple sclerosis patients.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune-type inflammatory disorder in human central nervous system. Recombinant interferon beta (IFN-β) decreases the number of relapses and postpones disability progression in MS. However, up to 50% of patients treated with interferon beta continue experiencing relapses and/or worsening disability. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in different genes have been known to show significant associations with response to IFN-β in MS patients. In the present work, we examined the potential role of TRAILR1 and GRIA3 genes polymorphisms on response to IFN-β therapy in Iranian MS patients. The DNA was extracted from blood samples by standard procedures from 73 patients diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis that were either responded to IFN-β or did not. We carried out RFLP -PCR and tetra-primer ARMS-PCR methods to study of rs20576 and rs12557782, respectively. All results were analyzed using the SPSS software. TRAILR1 rs20576 genotype frequencies in responders and non-responders were similar (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.26, P = 0.87, Fisher<sup>,</sup> s Exact test). Our results showed that response to IFN-β has not association with sex (p = 0.73). Also, genotypic frequencies of GRIA3 rs12557782 had no significant differences between two groups of female population (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.75, p = 0.15). Furthermore, it had not been any statistical differences between responder and non-responder males (χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.7, p = 0.4) related to the SNP. Our results analysis revealed no significant association between the studied SNPs (TRAILR1 rs20576 and GRIA3rs 12,557,782) and response to IFN-β in Iranian MS patients.
