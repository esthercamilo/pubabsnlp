Pharmacogenomic knowledge and awareness among diverse patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
We developed novel electronic phenotyping algorithms for the Bio<i>Me</i> biobank data, which accurately identified angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)-induced angioedema cases and controls. A survey was mailed to all 1075 patients and 91 were returned. Over a third reported that prescribing physicians had not discussed with them the concepts of interindividual drug response variability or adverse event risk, and 73% of patients were previously unaware of pharmacogenomics; however, most patients were interested in having pharmacogenomic testing. Moreover, 67% of patients indicated that pharmacogenomic testing would positively influence their medication compliance. In addition to identifying an innovative approach to define biobank cohorts for pharmacogenomic studies, these results indicate that patients are interested in pharmacogenomic testing, which could translate to improved adherence.
