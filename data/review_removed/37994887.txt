[The relationship of cytochrome P450 isoforms with the efficacy and safety of antipsychotic and antidepressant therapy].
Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is the leading enzyme in the biotransformation of most psychotropic drugs. CYP450 gene polymorphisms determine a patient's endophenotype with respect to the activity of enzymes of the family and affect the metabolism of prescribed antipsychotics and antidepressants. Categorizing patients by endophenotype during genotyping is likely to help simplify the selection of therapy in clinical practice. Co-prescribing drugs that may be inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 isoforms, in turn, may lead to adverse reactions or no effect of therapy. The article presents a compilation of known pharmacogenetic recommendations regarding the four major endophenotypes of metabolizers.
