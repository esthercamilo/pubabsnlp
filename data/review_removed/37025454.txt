Distribution of a novel <i>CYP2C</i> haplotype in Native American populations.
The <i>CYP2C19</i> gene, located in the <i>CYP2C</i> cluster, encodes the major drug metabolism enzyme CYP2C19. This gene is highly polymorphic and no-function (<i>CYP2C19*2</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i>*<i>3</i>), reduced function (<i>CYP2C19*9)</i> and increased function (<i>CYP2C19*1</i>7) star alleles (haplotypes) are commonly used to predict CYP2C19 metabolic phenotypes. <i>CYP2C19*17</i> and the genotype-predicted rapid (RM) and ultrarapid (UM) CYP2C19 metabolic phenotypes are absent or rare in several Native American populations. However, discordance between genotype-predicted and pharmacokinetically determined CYP2C19 phenotypes in Native American cohorts have been reported. Recently, a haplotype defined by rs2860840T and rs11188059G alleles in the <i>CYP2C</i> cluster has been shown to encode increased rate of metabolism of the CYP2C19 substrate escitalopram, to a similar extent as <i>CYP2C19*17</i>. We investigated the distribution of the <i>CYP2C:TG</i> haplotype and explored its potential impact on CYP2C19 metabolic activity in Native American populations. The study cohorts included individuals from the One Thousand Genomes Project AMR superpopulation (1 KG_AMR), the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), and from indigenous populations living in Brazil (Kaingang and Guarani). The frequency range of the <i>CYP2C:TG</i> haplotype in the study cohorts, 0.469 to 0.598, is considerably higher than in all 1 KG superpopulations (range: 0.014-to 0.340). We suggest that the high frequency of the <i>CYP2C:TG</i> haplotype might contribute to the reported discordance between <i>CYP2C19-</i>predicted and pharmacokinetically verified CYP2C19 metabolic phenotypes in Native American cohorts. However, functional studies involving genotypic correlations with pharmacokinetic parameters are warranted to ascertain the importance of the <i>CYP2C:TG</i> haplotype.
