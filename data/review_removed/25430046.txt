Impact of common ABCB1 polymorphism on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel and its metabolites.
The reasons of clopidogrel (CLP) resistance are still unclear. The response to CLP may be influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors. Among genetic factors, common polymorphisms in the gene coding glycoprotein-P (P-gp, MDR1 and ABCB1) are considered as potential determinants of the efficacy of CLP treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of ABCB1 3435C>T genetic polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CLP and its metabolites: diastereoisomers of thiol metabolite (the inactive H3 and the active H4) and inactive carboxylic derivative.
