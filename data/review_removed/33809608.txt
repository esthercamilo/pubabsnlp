Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacogenetics of Cyclophosphamide in a Neonate and Infant Childhood Cancer Patient Population.
Infants and young children represent an important but much understudied childhood cancer patient population. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of the widely used anticancer prodrug cyclophosphamide were investigated in children <2 years of age. Concentrations of cyclophosphamide and selected metabolites were determined in patients administered cyclophosphamide at doses ranging from 100-1500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (5-75 mg/kg), with various infusion times as determined by the standard treatment regimen that each patient was receiving. Polymorphisms in genes including CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 were investigated. Data generated for cyclophosphamide were analysed using a previously published population pharmacokinetic model. Cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics was assessed in 111 samples obtained from 25 patients ranging from 4-23 months of age. The average cyclophosphamide clearance for the patients was 46.6 mL/min/m<sup>2</sup> (ranging from 9.4-153 mL/min/m<sup>2</sup>), with marked inter-patient variability observed (CV 41%). No significant differences in cyclophosphamide clearance or exposure (AUC) were observed between patient groups as separated by age or body weight. However, marked differences in drug clearance and metabolism were noted between the current data in children <2 years of age and recently published results from a comparable study conducted by our group in older children, which reported significantly lower cyclophosphamide clearance values and metabolite exposures using the same population pharmacokinetic model for analysis. Whilst this study demonstrates no significant differences in cyclophosphamide clearance in patients <2 years, it highlights large differences in dosing protocols across tumour types. Furthermore, the study suggests marked differences in cyclophosphamide clearance in children less than two years of age as compared to older patients.
