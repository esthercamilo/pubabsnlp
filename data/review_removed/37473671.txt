Rates of 30-Day and 90-Day Readmission Between Genotype-Optimal and Genotype-Suboptimal Antiplatelet Therapy Prescribing After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.
Current evidence increasingly supports CYP2C19 genotype-guided P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor selection. Clopidogrel remains the most prescribed P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor despite higher readmission rates than those of more efficacious third-generation P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors. It remains unclear whether pharmacogenetically (PGx)-guided antiplatelet therapy directly reduces readmissions after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A single-center retrospective observational cohort study at a tertiary academic medical center was conducted. Patients receiving CYP2C19 genotyping after PCI were included and stratified into 2 groups (PGx-optimal vs PGx-suboptimal P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor prescribed) on the basis of CPIC (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium) recommendations. Primary outcomes included 30-day and 90-day readmissions after index PCI. Most patients (78%) were of non-European ancestry. Among patients receiving PGx-optimal therapy, 50% had acute coronary syndromes whereas 61% receiving PGx-suboptimal therapy had stable coronary artery disease. Comparable 30-day (12% vs 10%, p = 0.481) and 90-day readmission rates (24% vs 28%, p = 0.323) were observed between patients receiving PGx-optimal or PGx-suboptimal therapies. PGx-optimal therapy was associated with fewer emergency department visits (3.4% vs 4.0%, p = 0.021) within 30 days, and patients initially prescribed PGx-suboptimal therapy were switched more often to PGx-optimal therapy during a readmission than were patients prescribed PGx-suboptimal antiplatelet therapy (p <0.001). In conclusion, CYP2C19 genotype-guided P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor therapy did not improve 30- and 90-day all-cause readmission rates in a predominantly non-European population. However, P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor therapy became concordant with CYP2C19 genotype in approximately half of patients during the first readmission after PCI, which may present further opportunities to revisit and optimize dual antiplatelet therapy in patients who undergo PCI.
