[Genetic susceptibility to drug-induced liver injury].
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) risk prediction, diagnosis establishment, clinical management, and all other aspects are facing great challenges. Although the current understanding of its pathogenesis is still incomplete, research over the past 20 years has shown that genetic susceptibility may play an important role in the occurrence and development of DILI. In recent years, pharmacogenomics studies have further revealed the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, some non-HLA genes, and hepatotoxicity from certain drugs. However, due to the lack of well-designed, prospective, large-sample cohort validation and low positive predictive values, there may still be some way to go before the current results can be truly translated into clinical practice for precise prediction and prevention of DILI risk.
