Cytochrome P450 2C19 polymorphisms and valproic acid-induced weight gain.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 plays a role in the biotransformation of clinically relevant drugs as well as endogenous compounds, including sex hormones, which are known to be modulators of food intake and energy balance in humans. We attempted to investigate the influence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms on valproic acid (VPA)-induced weight gain.
