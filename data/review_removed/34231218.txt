Adverse Cardiovascular Outcomes and Antihypertensive Treatment: A Genome-Wide Interaction Meta-Analysis in the International Consortium for Antihypertensive Pharmacogenomics Studies.
We sought to identify genome-wide variants influencing antihypertensive drug response and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, utilizing data from four randomized controlled trials in the International Consortium for Antihypertensive Pharmacogenomics Studies (ICAPS). Genome-wide antihypertensive drug-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interaction tests for four drug classes (β-blockers, n = 9,195; calcium channel blockers (CCBs), n = 10,511; thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics, n = 3,516; ACE-inhibitors/ARBs, n = 2,559) and cardiovascular outcomes (incident myocardial infarction, stroke, or death) were analyzed among patients with hypertension of European ancestry. Top SNPs from the meta-analyses were tested for replication of cardiovascular outcomes in an independent Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) study (n = 21,267), blood pressure (BP) response in independent ICAPS studies (n = 1,552), and ethnic validation in African Americans from the Genetics of Hypertension Associated Treatment study (GenHAT; n = 5,115). One signal reached genome-wide significance in the β-blocker-SNP interaction analysis (rs139945292, Interaction P = 1.56 × 10<sup>-8</sup> ). rs139945292 was validated through BP response to β-blockers, with the T-allele associated with less BP reduction (systolic BP response P = 6 × 10<sup>-4</sup> , Beta = 3.09, diastolic BP response P = 5 × 10<sup>-3</sup> , Beta = 1.53). The T-allele was also associated with increased adverse cardiovascular risk within the β-blocker treated patients' subgroup (P = 2.35 × 10<sup>-4</sup> , odds ratio = 1.57, 95% confidence interval = 1.23-1.99). The locus showed nominal replication in CHARGE, and consistent directional trends in β-blocker treated African Americans. rs139945292 is an expression quantitative trait locus for the 50 kb upstream gene NTM (neurotrimin). No SNPs attained genome-wide significance for any other drugs classes. Top SNPs were located near CALB1 (CCB), FLJ367777 (ACE-inhibitor), and CES5AP1 (thiazide). The NTM region is associated with increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and less BP reduction in β-blocker treated patients. Further investigation into this region is warranted.
