The frequency of rs2231142 in <i>ABCG2</i> among Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander subgroups: implications for personalized rosuvastatin dosing.
Statins are among the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide. Rosuvastatin is a moderate- to high-intensity statin depending on the prescribed dose. Statin-associated muscle symptoms are the main side effects, contributing to low adherence to statins. The missense variant rs2231142 in <i>ABCG2</i> affects the functionality of the ABCG2 transporter, altering the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rosuvastatin. This special report aims to accentuate the importance of considering the <i>ABCG2</i> genotype upon prescribing rosuvastatin in high cardiovascular disease risk subgroups, specifically Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations. Based on the reported frequencies of rs2231142 in <i>ABCG2</i>, it may be justifiable to initiate low-dose rosuvastatin in Samoans relative to Marshallese or Native Hawaiians. Interpopulation differences in pharmacogenetic allele frequencies underscore the need to disaggregate broad population categories to achieve health equity in treatment outcomes.
