SLCO1B1 c.388A>G Polymorphism Is Associated with HDL-C Levels in Response to Atorvastatin in Chilean Individuals.
The use of statins as the preferred lipid-lowering therapy has clearly demonstrated its efficacy in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, reducing also the risk of coronary events and cardiovascular disease mortality. In this study, we assessed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLCO1B1 gene and their effect on atorvastatin response. We included 129 Chilean hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing 10 mg/day of atorvastatin therapy during 4 weeks. Lipid profile was determined before and after drug administration. Genotyping of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (c.521T>C) SNP was performed with allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, whilst polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used for genotyping the SLCO1B1 rs2306283 (c.388A>G) variant. After statin therapy, concentrations of TC, LDL-C and TG had a decrease from baseline (p < 0.05). Also, HDL-C levels increased (p < 0.05). Minor allele frequencies for the rs2306283 and rs4149056 variants were 0.547 and 0.136, respectively. LDL-C response to atorvastatin was not associated with the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 nor the rs2306283 polymorphisms (p > 0.05). However, the latter SNP was associated with HDL-C variability after atorvastatin medication (p = 0.02). This study indicates that LDL-C reduction following atorvastatin therapy is not influenced by the SNPs evaluated. In addition, the polymorphism rs2306283 at the SLCO1B1 gene determines greater HDL-C concentrations in response to atorvastatin medication in Chilean hypercholesterolemic subjects.
