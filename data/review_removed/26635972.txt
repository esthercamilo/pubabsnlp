Development of NanoART for HIV Treatment: Minding the Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes.
Sustained suppression of HIV viral load is the primary objective for HIV treatment, which successfully achieved by the use of a wide array of antiretroviral therapies (ART). Despite this enormous success low level of virus persists in the anatomical and cellular reservoirs of the body causing a multitude of immunological and neurocognitive deficits. Towards this, nano-formulations are gaining attention to solve these problems by delivering ART to the targeted locations such as brain, lymphoid tissues, and monocytes/macrophages. As cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play a critical role in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics, it is expected that the interaction of nanoparticles with CYP enzymes may result in adverse drug reactions, cellular toxicity, and alterations in CYP-mediated metabolism of other drug molecules. Considering these potential adverse outcomes it is imperative to design the nano-carriers that will have minimal impact on CYP enzymes. Therefore, developing a long-acting nanoART regimen with minimal side effects is an essential step to improve patient's adherence to the treatment paradigm, effective treatment strategy, and to combat the HIV infection & AIDS.
