Pharmacogenomics and tailored polypharmacy: an 80-year-old lady with rosuvastatin-associated rhabdomyolysis and maprotiline-related Ogilvie's syndromeâ€©.
What is known and objectives: Multiple adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are expected, and thus should be prevented in the elderly comorbid patient on polypharmacy. Rosuvastatin is commonly prescribed for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic diseases, and in rare cases, is associated with rhabdomyolysis. Maprotiline is a tetracyclic antidepressant, infrequently used in the United States, but seemingly more broadly in European countries. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) caused by maprotiline has thus far, to our knowledge, not yet been described in the literature.
