A 6-week laboratory research rotation in pharmacogenomics: a model for preparing pharmacy students to practice precision medicine.
Comparison of human genome sequences from different individuals has unraveled that genes involved in the drug efficacy and metabolism are polymorphic, harboring mutations, splicing variations and other alterations. These data provide a reasonable explanation for the inter-individual variations observed in drug therapy. Thus, a detailed molecular analysis and an in-depth knowledge of these genes is a prerequisite to practice pharmacogenomics-based medicine. We have introduced a 6-week laboratory research rotation to train students in the expression analysis of different pharmacogenes combined with bioinformatics tools. Students were first introduced to the bioinformatics tools to identify appropriate DNA primers to amplify specific pharmacogenes from the laboratory cancer cell lines. The amplified DNA fragments were sequenced. Finally, students were trained in bioinformatics tools to establish the identity of these DNA sequences. The possible implications of this laboratory training in developing problem-solving skills needed in the implementation of pharmacogenomics knowledge in the clinic, are discussed.
