Type 2 diabetes: an exploratory genetic association analysis of selected metabolizing enzymes and transporters and effects on cardiovascular and renal biomarkers.
This study sought to identify potential pharmacogenetic associations of selected enzymes and transporters with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In addition, pharmacogenomic profiles, concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) or kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and several covariates were investigated.
