Drug resistance and secondary treatment of ischaemic stroke: The genetic component of the response to acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel.
Cerebrovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel are the most widely-used antiplatelet drugs for secondary prevention of recurrent thromboembolic events. However, there have been cases in which antiplatelet drugs did not inhibit platelet activity; this phenomenon is called resistance, and it may be modulated at the genetic level.
