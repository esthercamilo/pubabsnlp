Pharmacogenomics deliberations of 2-deoxy-d-glucose in the treatment of COVID-19 disease: an in silico approach.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) prompted number of computational and laboratory efforts to discover molecules against the virus entry or replication. Simultaneously, due to the availability of clinical information, drug-repurposing efforts led to the discovery of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) for treating COVID-19 infection. 2-DG critically accumulates in the infected cells to prevent energy production and viral replication. As there is no clarity on the impact of genetic variations on the efficacy and adverse effects of 2-DG in treating COVID-19 using in silico approaches, we attempted to extract the genes associated with the 2-DG pathway using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. The interaction between selected genes was assessed using ClueGO, to identify the susceptible gene loci for SARS-CoV infections. Further, SNPs that were residing in the distinct genomic regions were retrieved from the Ensembl genome browser and characterized. A total of 80 SNPs were retrieved using diverse bioinformatics resources after assessing their (a) detrimental influence on the protein stability using Swiss-model, (b) miRNA regulation employing miRNASNP3, PolymiRTS, MirSNP databases, (c) binding of transcription factors by SNP2TFBS, SNPInspector, and (d) enhancers regulation using EnhancerDB and HaploReg reported A2M rs201769751, PARP1 rs193238922 destabilizes protein, six polymorphisms of XIAP effecting microRNA binding sites, <i>EGFR</i> rs712829 generates 15 TFBS, <i>BECN1</i> rs60221525, <i>CASP9</i> rs4645980, <i>SLC2A2</i> rs5393 impairs 14 TFBS, <i>STK11</i> rs3795063 altered 19 regulatory motifs. These data may provide the relationship between genetic variations and drug effects of 2-DG which may further assist in assigning the right individuals to benefit from the treatment.
