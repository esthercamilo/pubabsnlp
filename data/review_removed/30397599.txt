Associations between the <i>LEP</i> -2548G/A Promoter and Baseline Weight and between <i>LEPR</i> Gln223Arg and Lys656Asn Variants and Change in BMI <i>z</i> Scores in Arab Children and Adolescents Treated with Risperidone.
Data on baseline (antipsychotics-naïve) age, weight, and height, and change in these at 3 subsequent follow-up time points up to 313.6 days (95% CI 303.5-323.7) were collected from 181 risperidone-treated children and adolescents (mean age 12.58 years, SD 4.99, range 2.17-17.7) attending a pediatric neurology clinic in Saudi Arabia. Owing to differences in genotypic distributions in the subsamples, results are reported for the white Arab population (<i>n</i> = 144). Age- and gender-normed body mass index (BMI)-standardized <i>z</i> scores (BMI <i>z</i>) were calculated (LMSgrowth program). Linear regression was performed for baseline weight and BMI <i>z</i>, while change in BMI <i>z</i> was assessed using random effects ordered logistic regression. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed: rs7799039 in the <i>LEP</i> promoter, rs1805094 (previously rs8179183), rs1137100 and rs1137101 in the <i>LEPR</i>, and rs1414334 in <i>HTR2C</i>. We found a nominally significant association between rs7799309 and baseline weight, adjusting for height, age, gender, and diagnosis (A/G, <i>p</i> = 0.035, β = -3.62 vs. G/G). The rs1137101 (G/G, <i>p</i> = 0.018, odds ratio [OR] = 4.13 vs. A/A) and rs1805094 C allele carriers (<i>p</i> = 0.019, OR = 0.51) showed nominally significant associations with change in BMI <i>z</i> categories. Our data support and replicate previous relevant associations for these variants (including with weight gain when on risperidone), whilst being the first report of such associations in patients of Arab ethnicity.
