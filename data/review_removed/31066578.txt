Pharmacogenetics of Sertraline Tolerability and Response in Pediatric Anxiety and Depressive Disorders.
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To determine whether genetic variants in a pharmacokinetic gene (the number of <i>CYP2C19</i> reduced function alleles [RFAs]), and in pharmacodynamic genes (<i>HTR2A</i>, <i>SLC6A4</i>, and <i>GRIK4</i>) influence sertraline tolerability and response in a cohort of pediatric patients with anxiety and depressive disorders. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A retrospective analysis was performed using the electronic medical record data of 352 patients <19 years of age being treated for anxiety and/or depressive disorders with sertraline and who underwent routine clinical <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping. Additional genotyping and analysis of variants in <i>HTR2A</i>, <i>SLC6A4</i>, and <i>GRIK4</i> were conducted for 249 patients. Multivariate regression models testing for associations with <i>CYP2C19</i> were adjusted for concomitant use of interacting medications. Combinatorial classification and regression tree (CART) analyses containing all pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genes and clinical factors were performed. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The maximum sertraline dose during the initial titration period of sertraline was inversely associated with the number of <i>CYP2C19</i> RFAs and sertraline dose at 60 (<i>p</i> = 0.025) and 90 days (<i>p</i> = 0.025). <i>HTR2A</i> rs6313 was associated with sertraline dose (<i>p</i> = 0.011) and time to the average maximum sertraline dose (<i>p</i> = 0.039). Regarding efficacy, the number of <i>CYP2C19</i> RFAs was not associated with the sertraline dose at the time of response (<i>p</i> = 0.22), whereas for the pharmacodynamic genes, only <i>HTR2A</i> rs6313 was associated with response dose (<i>p</i> = 0.022). An association was observed between predicted expression levels of <i>SLC6A4</i> and the duration on sertraline (<i>p</i> = 0.025). Combinatorial CART and multivariate regression analyses implicated that pharmacodynamic genes and clinical factors influence the maximum sertraline dose and response dose. The total number of side effects was not associated with any of the variants tested. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors, in addition to clinical and demographic components, influence sertraline dose, response, and tolerability, thereby necessitating further research to assess for the validity of these pharmacogenetic associations in children and adolescents.
