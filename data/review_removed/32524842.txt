Perspective on <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping test among patients with acute coronary syndrome - a qualitative study.
<b>Aim:</b> Identify factors patients consider regarding <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping test to guide choice of antiplatelet therapy. <b>Patients & methods:</b> Patient's perception and attitude toward use of <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping test was gathered according to an interview guide. Thematic analysis was conducted. <b>Results:</b> A total of 14 patients were interviewed. The main factors found to influence uptake of <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping test are, convenience of genotyping test (n = 4), physician's recommendation (n = 11), prior explanation of genetic testing by medical personnel (n = 5) and inclination toward clopidogrel, with three sub-factors; less frequent dosing (n = 3), lower cost (n = 7) and lower risk of bleeding (n = 9). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study provided the information needed to develop a discrete choice experiment to empirically quantify patients' preference and willingness to pay for genetic testing and to simulate uptake.
