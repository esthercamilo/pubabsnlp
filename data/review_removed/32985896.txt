Tacrolimus Starting Dose Prediction Based on Genetic Polymorphisms and Clinical Factors in Chinese Renal Transplant Recipients.
<b><i>Aims:</i></b> Tacrolimus has extensive pharmacokinetic variability among patients and a narrow therapeutic window. The U.S. Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends a starting dose for tacrolimus of 0.15-0.3 mg/kg/day, which is much higher compared with 0.05-0.15 mg/kg/day used in China. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of clinical factors and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on tacrolimus concentrations in Chinese renal transplant recipients. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This study enrolled 406 tacrolimus-treated patients. After renal transplantation, the first tacrolimus trough concentration and corresponding clinical information were collected from all patients. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to genotype 15 SNPs. The relationship between the genetic and clinical factors and dose-adjusted tacrolimus trough concentration was examined. The tacrolimus starting dose was predicted using a classification and regression tree analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Examination of the 15 SNPs and several clinical factors identified the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype (<i>p</i> = 5.6 × 10<sup>-11</sup>) and hemoglobin (<i>p</i> = 8.4 × 10<sup>-10</sup>) as the most significant determinants of tacrolimus C<sub>0</sub>/D. Accordingly, a concise tacrolimus recommendation dosage model, a classification scheme, and a regression tree were developed. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> A new classification and regression tree model was developed for establishing the starting dose of tacrolimus based on the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype and hemoglobin values. This result may help clinicians prescribe an appropriate initial tacrolimus dose. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: 2020-KY-147.
