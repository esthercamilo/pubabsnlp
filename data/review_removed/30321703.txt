Effect of genetic and patient factors on warfarin pharmacodynamics following warfarin withdrawal: Implications for patients undergoing surgery.
Warfarin therapy is stopped for a fixed period prior to surgery to minimise risk of perioperative bleeding. However, anticoagulation subsides at varying rates among different patients. We evaluated the influence of genetic (CYP2C9 and VKORC1), patient and clinical factors on warfarin clearance and the decline in INR following warfarin withdrawal.
