CYP3A subfamily activity affects the equilibrium concentration of Phenazepam<sup>®</sup> in patients with anxiety disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorder.
Phenazepam<sup>®</sup> is prescribed to relieve anxiety and sleep disorders during alcohol withdrawal, although it is associated with undesirable side effects. <b>Aim:</b> To demonstrate changes in the safety and efficacy profiles of Phenazepam in patients with anxiety disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorder. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A total of 94 Russian patients with alcohol use disorder received 4.0 mg of Phenazepam per day in tablets. We used a urinary 6-beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio to evaluate CYP3A activity. <b>Results:</b> A statistically significant inverse correlation between Phenazepam plasma concentration and CYP3A activity was found (r = -0.340 and p = 0.017). Correlation between the concentration/dose ratio and phenotyping results was also statistically significant (r = 0.301 and p = 0.026). <b>Conclusion:</b> The safety and efficacy of Phenazepam depend on CYP3A genetic polymorphisms.
