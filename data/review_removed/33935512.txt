The Impact of ABCB1 and CES1 Polymorphisms on Dabigatran Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Chinese Subjects.
Dabigatran is a novel direct oral anticoagulant agent, whose plasma concentration is closely related to bleeding risk. Genetic polymorphisms can affect the level of plasma dabigatran. The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between dabigatran-related genes and the plasma level of dabigatran in healthy Chinese subjects after taking a single oral dose. This study was performed with a single-center, single-dose, randomized, open-label, and four-period crossover trial design under both fasting and fed conditions. A total of 106 eligible healthy subjects were enrolled in the study and 104 were genotyped. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare pharmacokinetic parameters among different genotypes and linear regression was applied to explore the multiplicative interaction between variables. In this study, we found that the genotype frequencies of CES1 rs2244613 and CES1 rs8192935 were significantly different between Chinese and Caucasians, but the genotype frequencies of ABCB1 rs1045642 and ABCB1 rs4148738 were similar in both populations. CES1 rs8192935 were associated with the peak concentration of dabigatran. There was no significant gender difference in the exposure level of dabigatran. Furthermore, food significantly delayed the absorption of dabigatran but had little effect on C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-âˆž</sub>.
