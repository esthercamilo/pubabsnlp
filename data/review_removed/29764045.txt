Molecular profiling and companion diagnostics: where is personalized medicine in cancer heading?
The goal of personalized medicine is to use the right drug at the right dose - with minimal or no toxicity - for the right patient at the right time. Recent advances in understanding cell biology and pathways, and in using molecular 'omics' technologies to diagnose cancer, offer a strategic bridge to personalized medicine in cancer. Modern personalized medicine takes into account an individual's genetic makeup and disease history before developing a treatment regimen. The future of clinical oncology will be based on the use of predictive and prognostic biomarkers in patient management. Once implemented widely, personalized medicine will benefit patients and the healthcare system greatly.
