Genetic variants associated with glycemic response to treatment with dipeptidylpeptidase 4 inhibitors.
<b>Aim:</b> We examined associations of eight SNPs in/near seven candidate genes with glycemic response to 6 month treatment with DPP4 inhibitors. <b>Patients & methods:</b> 206 patients with type 2 diabetes (116 men and 90 women) were treated with sitagliptin or vildagliptin (both 100 mg/day) in combination with metformin or metformin/sulphonylurea over 6 months, and the reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) was measured. <b>Results:</b> Rs6923761 in <i>GLP1R</i> was significantly associated with a reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (adjusted p = 0.006). Homozygotes for the minor A allele had smaller reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> by 0.4% (4 mmol/mol) than the G allele carriers (p = 0.016). <b>Conclusion:</b> The missense variant rs6923761 in the <i>GLP1R</i> gene was associated with a smaller glycemic response to 6 month gliptin therapy in diabetic patients of central European origin.
