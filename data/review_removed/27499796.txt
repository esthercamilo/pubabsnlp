Frequency distribution of polymorphisms of CYP2C19, CYP2C9, VKORC1 and SLCO1B1 genes in the Yakut population.
Allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are variable among different populations; therefore the study of SNPs in ethnic groups is important for establishing the clinical significance of the screening of these polymorphisms. The main goal of the research is to study the polymorphisms of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, VKORC1, and SLCO1B1 in Yakuts. Genomic DNA from 229 Yakut subjects were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (SLCO1B1 +521T > C, VKORC1 -1639G>A, CYP2C19 +681G>A, +636G>A, CYP2C9 +430ะก>T, +1075A>C). Genotype frequencies of polymorphisms in the population of the Yakuts were more characteristic of the Asian population. The results have been included in the software application "Lekgen" that we developed for the interpretation of pharmacogenetic testing. The data of our study obtained on frequency carriers of polymorphisms of genes SLCO1B1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, VKORC1 among the Yakuts may be useful in developing recommendations for a personalized therapy.
