Familial Success in Allergen Desensitization.
Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a widely prevalent immunoglobulin E-mediated inflammatory nasal condition resulting from reexposure to an allergen in a sensitized individual. The genetic associations behind AR and other allergic conditions have been studied. However, familial success with AR therapies, specifically allergen desensitization through subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), has never been reported in the literature. Pharmocogenetics has been gradually applied to link heritable genetic variants with drug responses, such as intergenic region variants APOBEC3B and APOBEC3C and Î²2-adrenergic receptor and glycoprotein ADAM33 polymorphisms as predictive biomarkers for biologic treatment response in asthma. We provide the first reported survey of familial success with SCIT.
