Advances in personalized medicine and noninvasive diagnostics in solid organ transplantation.
Personalized medicine has been a mainstay and in practice in transplant pharmacotherapy since the advent of the field. Decisions pertaining to the diagnosis, selection, and monitoring of transplant pharmacotherapy are aimed toward the individual, the allograft, and the overall immunologic needs of the patient. Recent advances in pharmacogenomics, noninvasive biomarkers, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have the promise of transforming the way we individualize treatment and monitor allograft function. Pharmacogenomic testing can provide clinicians with additional data that can minimize toxicity and maximize therapeutic dosing in high-risk patients, leading to more informed decisions that may decrease the risk of rejection and adverse outcomes related to immunosuppressive therapies. Development of noninvasive strategies to monitor allograft function may offer safer and more convenient methods to detect allograft injury. Cell free DNA and gene expression profiling offer the potential to serve as "liquid biopsies" minimizing the risk to patients and providing clinicians with useful molecular data that may help individualize immunosuppression and rejection treatment. Use of big data in transplant and novel AI platforms, such as the iBox, hold tremendous promise in providing clinicians a "glimpse into the future" thereby allowing for a more individualized approach to immunosuppressive therapy that may minimize future adverse outcomes. Advances in diagnostics, laboratory science, and AI have made the application of personalized medicine even more tailored for solid organ transplant recipients. In this perspective, we summarize the current and emerging tools available, literature supporting use, and the horizon for future personalization of transplantation.
