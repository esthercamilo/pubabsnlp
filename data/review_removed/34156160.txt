ADME gene polymorphisms do not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel: Results from a population pharmacokinetic study in Indian cancer patients.
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of docetaxel is characterized by high inter-individual variability (IIV). While covariate models that explain the PK variability of docetaxel exist, not much is known about the effects of genetic variations on docetaxel disposition.
