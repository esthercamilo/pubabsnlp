Pharmacogenomic variants affecting efficacy and toxicity of statins in a south Asian population from Sri Lanka.
<b>Aim:</b> To describe the diversity of pharmacogenetic variants of statins among Sri Lankans. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Variant data of relevant genes were obtained from an anonymized database of 426 Sri Lankans. Minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were compared with published data from other populations. <b>Results:</b> The MAF of <i>SLCO1B1*5</i> (rs4149056 [T>C]) was 18.19% (95% CI: 14.53-21.85). MAFs of <i>CYP2C9*2</i> (rs1799853 [C>T]) and <i>CYP2C9*3</i> (rs1057910 [A>C]) were 2.58% (95% CI: 1.08-4.08) and 10.30% (95% CI: 7.75-13.61), respectively. MAFs of rs2231142 (G>T) (<i>ABCG2</i>), rs7412 (C>T) (<i>APOE</i>) and rs20455 (A>G) (<i>KIF6</i>) variantsÂ were 10.68% (95% CI: 7.76-13.60), 3.52% (95% CI: 1.77-5.27) and 50.7% (95% CI: 45.96-55.45), respectively. Compared with western/other Asian populations, rs20455 (A>G), <i>CYP2C9*3</i> (A>C) and <i>SLCO1B1*5</i> (T>C) variants were significantly higher in Sri Lankans. <b>Conclusion:</b> Variants that affect efficacy of statins (<i>KIF6</i> [rs20455], <i>CYP2C9*3</i>) and increase risk of statin-induced myotoxicity (<i>SLCO1B1*5</i> and <i>CYP2C9*3</i>) were prevalent in higher frequencies among Sri Lankans compared with western populations.
