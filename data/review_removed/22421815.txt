Pharmacogenetic determinants of mercaptopurine disposition in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
The backbone of drug therapy used in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children includes 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). Intracellular metabolism of this prodrug is a key component of the therapeutic response. Many metabolizing enzymes are involved in 6-MP disposition and active 6-MP metabolites are represented by 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) and methylated metabolites primarily methylated by the thiopurine S-methyltransferase enzyme (TPMT). The genetic polymorphism affecting TPMT activity displays an important inter-subject variability in metabolites pharmacokinetics and influences the balance between 6-MP efficacy and toxicity: patients with high 6-TGN levels are at risk of myelosuppression while patients with high levels of methylated derivates are at hepatotoxic risk. However, the genetic TPMT polymorphism does not explain all 6-MP adverse events and some severe toxicities leading to life-threatening conditions remain unexplained. Additional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding enzymes involved in 6-MP metabolism and 6-MP transporters may also be responsible for this inter-individual 6-MP response variability.
