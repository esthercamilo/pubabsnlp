Development of a broad-based ADME panel for use in pharmacogenomic studies.
To optimally address the interindividual variability observed in pharmacokinetic drug response, we have created a custom genotyping panel that interrogates most of the key genetic variations present in a set of 181 prioritized genes responsible for the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of many therapeutic agents. This consensus list of genes and variants was based on the ADME core and extended gene lists compiled by a group of pharmaceutical companies as having relevance. Although these pharmacokinetic genes and pathways are well known, tools that can interrogate a large number of these genes simultaneously within a single experiment are not currently available.
