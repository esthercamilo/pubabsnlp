Pharmacogenetic relevant polymorphisms of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5 in Bhutanese population.
Background Marked differences among genotype frequencies (Caucasians, Asians, and Africans) have been observed in cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes. Data on the frequency of pharmacogenetic relevant polymorphisms in Bhutanese population is absent. This study aimed to investigate the frequencies of pharmacogenetic relevant polymorphisms of CYP2C9 (*2 and *3), CYP2C19 (*2 and *3), CYP2D6 (*10), and CYP3A5 (*3) in Bhutanese population. Methods Genotyping was performed in 443 DNA samples using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results For CYP2C9, allele frequencies of *2 and *3 variants were 0.339% and 0%, respectively. For CYP2C19, frequencies of *2 and *3 variants were 30.135% and 15.689%, respectively. Allele frequencies of CYP2D6*10 and CYP3A5*3 were 21.332% and 77.314%, respectively. Allele frequencies of CYP2C9*2 are similar to most Asians while CYP2C9*3 was absent. CYP2C19*2 showed a close resemblance to Japanese and Burmese, while CYP2C19*3 is near to Japanese and Korean. CYP2D6*10 is noticeably lower than other Asians. CYP3A5*3 is similar to East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). Conclusions The Bhutanese population is polymorphic for these CYP genes, except for CYP2C9*3. Similar to other populations, genetic testing for these genes may, therefore, be helpful to obtain the benefit from pharmacological treatments and prevent adverse drug reactions.
