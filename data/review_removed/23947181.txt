[Introductory remarks by chairpersons].
Personalized medicine (PM) is expected to change the healthcare system due to great progress in areas such as pharmacogenomics (PGx) and molecular diagnostics; however, PM is more popular in oncology than in clinic practice. Oncological therapies are easily personalized because accurate diagnostic tests are available to identify patients who can benefit from targeted therapies. Nevertheless, personalized medicine has become a more imminent reality for several reasons, such as the increased awareness of drugs with an adequate benefit/risk ratio to patients, better methods to optimize drug selection and dosing and so on. We invited four speakers to discuss the importance of PGx in the practice of PM from the viewpoint of basic and clinical research.
