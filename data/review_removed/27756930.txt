Effects of Using Personal Genotype Data on Student Learning and Attitudes in a Pharmacogenomics Course.
<b>Objective.</b> To evaluate the impact of personal genotyping and a novel educational approach on student attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs regarding pharmacogenomics and genomic medicine. <b>Methods.</b> Two online elective courses (pharmacogenomics and genomic medicine) were offered to student pharmacists at the University of Florida using a flipped-classroom, patient-centered teaching approach. In the pharmacogenomics course, students could be genotyped and apply results to patient cases. <b>Results.</b> Thirty-four and 19 student pharmacists completed the pharmacogenomics and genomic medicine courses, respectively, and 100% of eligible students (n=34) underwent genotyping. Student knowledge improved after the courses. Seventy-four percent (n=25) of students reported better understanding of pharmacogenomics based on having undergone genotyping. <b>Conclusions.</b> Completion of a novel pharmacogenomics elective course sequence that incorporated personal genotyping and genomic medicine was associated with increased student pharmacist knowledge and improved clinical confidence with pharmacogenomics.
