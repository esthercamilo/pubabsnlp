Introduction to Personalized Medicine in Pediatrics.
Exciting new developments in biomedical and computational sciences provide an extraordinary and unparalleled opportunity to compile, connect, and analyze multiple types of "big data," driving the development of personalized medicine. These insights must begin in early life (ie, pregnancy, neonatal, and infancy) and focus on early prevention, diagnosis, and intervention-areas of medicine where pediatricians are poised to lead the way to a personalized medicine future. The rapid growth of genomics (including pharmacogenomics), transcriptomics, and related "omics" has revolutionized the diagnosis of rare monogenic disorders. It is now clarifying the pathogenesis of complex conditions ranging from autism spectrum disorder to asthma. Collaborations between clinicians and basic scientists integrating multiomics approaches in evaluating children with severe illness are transforming the fields of perinatal, neonatal, and pediatric critical care medicine. Improvements in rapid diagnostic and prognostic information suggest that pediatric personalized medicine is under way and has an exciting future. <b>[<i>Pediatr Ann</i>. 2022;51(10):e381-e386.]</b>.
