Population structure and pharmacogenomic risk stratification in the United States.
Pharmacogenomic (PGx) variants mediate how individuals respond to medication, and response differences among racial/ethnic groups have been attributed to patterns of PGx diversity. We hypothesized that genetic ancestry (GA) would provide higher resolution for stratifying PGx risk, since it serves as a more reliable surrogate for genetic diversity than self-identified race/ethnicity (SIRE), which includes a substantial social component. We analyzed a cohort of 8628 individuals from the United States (US), for whom we had both SIRE information and whole genome genotypes, with a focus on the three largest SIRE groups in the US: White, Black (African-American), and Hispanic (Latino). Our approach to the question of PGx risk stratification entailed the integration of two distinct methodologies: population genetics and evidence-based medicine. This integrated approach allowed us to consider the clinical implications for the observed patterns of PGx variation found within and between population groups.
