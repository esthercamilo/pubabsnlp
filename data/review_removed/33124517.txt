Nonresponse to high-dose bupropion for depression in a patient carrying <i>CYP2B6</i>*6 and <i>CYP2C19</i>*17 variants: a case report.
We report the case of a patient with major depression treated with high-dose bupropion due to prior detected subtherapeutic blood concentrations at standard dosing. Pharmacogenetic panel testing identified the patient as a carrier of the <i>CYP2B6</i>*6 allele, which has been associated with reduced bupropion metabolism and decreased concentrations of the pharmacologically active metabolite hydroxybupropion. Interestingly, we also found the patient to be homozygous for the <i>CYP2C19</i>*17 allele, predicting an ultra rapid metabolizer phenotype. We propose a combined effect of the detected <i>CYP2C19</i> and <i>CYP2B6</i> genetic variants on bupropion metabolism. This case underlines the potential benefit of pre-emptive pharmacogenotyping but also the yet still fragmentary evidence making precise pharmacogenotype guided antidepressant selection and dosing challenging.
