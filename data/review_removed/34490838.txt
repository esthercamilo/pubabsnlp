Strategies to improve pharmacogenomic-guided treatment options for patients with β-hemoglobinopathies.
Drug efficacy and toxicity are closely related to the unique genetic profile of individuals, or pharmacogenomics. Despite the fact that cardiology, psychiatry and oncology are among the clinical specialties in which pharmacogenomics has become a clinical reality, the utility of pharmacogenomics has yet to be demonstrated for several other medical specialties. Over the last 15 years, genomic variants in a number of loci have been shown to be significantly associated with the fetal hemoglobin (HbF) response to hydroxyurea, the only approved drug for HbF induction for sickle cell disease. Here, we provide an update and discuss future challenges to the application of pharmacogenomics to improve therapies for β-hemoglobinopathies in relation to the current pharmacological treatment modalities for those disorders.
