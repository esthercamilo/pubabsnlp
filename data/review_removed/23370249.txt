Pharmacogenetics in the evaluation of new drugs: a multiregional regulatory perspective.
Pharmacogenetics, one of the cornerstones of personalized medicine, has the potential to change the way in which health care is offered by stratifying patients into various pretreatment categories, such as likely responders, likely non-responders or likely to experience adverse drug reactions. In order to advance drug development and regulatory science, regulatory agencies globally have promulgated guidelines on pharmacogenetics for nearly a decade. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of new guidelines for the implementation of pharmacogenetics in drug development from a multiregional regulatory perspective - encompassing Europe, the United States and Japan - with an emphasis on clinical pharmacokinetics.
