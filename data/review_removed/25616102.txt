Genetics and nonmelanoma skin cancer in kidney transplant recipients.
Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) have a 65- to 250-fold greater risk than the general population of developing nonmelanoma skin cancer. Immunosuppressive drugs combined with traditional risk factors such as UV radiation exposure are the main modifiable risk factors for skin cancer development in transplant recipients. Genetic variation affecting immunosuppressive drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics has been associated with other transplant complications and may contribute to differences in skin cancer rates between KTRs. Genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding the prednisolone receptor, GST enzyme, MC1R, MTHFR enzyme and COX-2 enzyme have been shown to increase the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in KTRs. Genetic association studies may improve our understanding of how genetic variation affects skin cancer risk and potentially guide immunosuppressive treatment and skin cancer screening in at risk individuals.
