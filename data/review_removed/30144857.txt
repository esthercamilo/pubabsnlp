Prevention of Prematurity: Advances and Opportunities.
Preterm birth (PTB) rate varies widely and has significant racial and ethnic disparities. Although causal mechanisms are ill understood, socioenvironment, phenotype, and genotype provide insight into pathways for preventing PTB. Data suggest varied response to current medical interventions is explicable Approved by underlying pharmacogenomics. Currently, prevention focuses on minimizing iatrogenic PTB and risk reduction especially in those with prior PTB using proven medical and public health strategies. In the future, preventive approaches will be based on better understanding of sociodemography, nutrition, lifestyles, and underlying individual genetic and epigenetic variation. Statistical approaches and "big-data" models are critical in future study.
