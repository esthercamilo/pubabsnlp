Gene-Wise Burden of Coding Variants Correlates to Noncoding Pharmacogenetic Risk Variants.
Genetic variability can modulate individual drug responses. A significant portion of pharmacogenetic variants reside in the noncoding genome yet it is unclear if the noncoding variants directly influence protein function and expression or are present on a haplotype including a functionally relevant genetic variation (synthetic association). Gene-wise variant burden (GVB) is a gene-level measure of deleteriousness, reflecting the cumulative effects of deleterious coding variants, predicted in silico. To test potential associations between noncoding and coding pharmacogenetic variants, we computed a drug-level GVB for 5099 drugs from DrugBank for 2504 genomes of the 1000 Genomes Project and evaluated the correlation between the long-known noncoding variant-drug associations in PharmGKB, with functionally relevant rare and common coding variants aggregated into GVBs. We obtained the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) by comparing the drug-level GVB ranks against the corresponding pharmacogenetic variants-drug associations in PharmGKB. We obtained high overall AUCs (0.710 ± 0.022-0.734 ± 0.018) for six different methods (i.e., SIFT, MutationTaster, Polyphen-2 HVAR, Polyphen-2 HDIV, phyloP, and GERP<sup>++</sup>), and further improved the ethnicity-specific validations (0.759 ± 0.066-0.791 ± 0.078). These results suggest that a significant portion of the long-known noncoding variant-drug associations can be explained as synthetic associations with rare and common coding variants burden of the corresponding pharmacogenes.
