Improved HPLC Quantification of 6-Mercaptopurine Metabolites in Red Blood Cells: Monitoring Data and Literature Analysis.
Thiopurine drugs azathioprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are used extensively in pediatric and adult patients with inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. They are metabolized to 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) or to 6-methyl-mercaptopurine nucleotides (6-MMPN). The balance between 6-TGN and 6-MMPN is highly variable and monitoring is recommended, but its benefit in outcome gives rise to conflicting results, potentially increased by differences in quantifying 6-MP metabolism. Our aim was to report (1) the HPLC-UV procedure used in our laboratory to quantify red blood cells (RBCs) with 6-TGN and 6-MMPN (as its derivate: 6-MMP(d)) in patients treated with thiopurines and (2) additional tests, sometimes confirmatory, to improve method standardization. The comparison of two methods to count RBCs shows that metabolite concentrations were slightly lower in the washed and resuspended RBCs than in whole blood. Perchloric acid (0.7 M), dithiothreitol (DTT, final 0.013 M sample concentration) and 60 min hydrolysis were selected for acid hydrolysis. (3) Monitoring data from 83 patients receiving AZA or 6-MP showed that at steady state, only 53/183 (29%) had 6-TGN and 6-MMPN in the recommended therapeutic range. Our method is discussed in light of the technical conditions and sample stability data from 17 publications identified since the first analytical report in 1987. Monitoring data demonstrate, if required, that inter-patient variability in 6-TGN and 6-MMPN concentrations is high in samples from treated patients.
