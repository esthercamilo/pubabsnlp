iGMDR: Integrated Pharmacogenetic Resource Guide to Cancer Therapy and Research.
Current pharmacogenetic studies have obtained many genetic models that can predict the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs. Although some of these models are of crucial importance and have been used in clinical practice, these very valuable models have not been well adopted into cancer research to promote the development of cancer therapies due to the lack of integration and standards for the existing data of the pharmacogenetic studies. For this purpose, we built a resource investigating genetic model of drug response (iGMDR), which integrates the models from in vitro and in vivo pharmacogenetic studies with different omics data from a variety of technical systems. In this study, we introduced a standardized process for all integrations, and described how users can utilize these models to gain insights into cancer. iGMDR is freely accessible at https://igmdr.modellab.cn.
