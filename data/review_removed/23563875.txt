Pharmacology and pharmacogenomics of neurological medications used in pregnancy.
Pregnancy increases the pharmacological management challenge of numerous neurological diseases as a result of complex physiological changes. Understanding pregnancy-induced changes in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters can lead to better outcomes for both the mother and baby. Although the application of pharmacogenomics in maternal-fetal medicine is in its infancy, further research and developments will provide important new developments for managing the efficacy of drug treatments during pregnancy and improving maternal-fetal safety. Although a wide variety of neurological medications are used during pregnancy, this article will focus on the drugs with currently known pharmacogenomic implications.
