Genome Wide Epistasis Study of On-Statin Cardiovascular Events with Iterative Feature Reduction and Selection.
Predicting risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) is an evidence-based practice that incorporates lifestyle, history, and other risk factors. Statins reduce risk for MACE by decreasing lipids, but it is difficult to stratify risk following initiation of a statin. Genetic risk determinants for on-statin MACE are low-effect size and impossible to generalize. Our objective was to determine high-level epistatic risk factors for on-statin MACE with GWAS-scale data. Controlled-access data for 5890 subjects taking a statin collected from Vanderbilt University Medical Center's BioVU were obtained from dbGaP. We used Random Forest Iterative Feature Reduction and Selection (RF-IFRS) to select highly informative genetic and environmental features from a GWAS-scale dataset of patients taking statin medications. Variant-pairs were distilled into overlapping networks and assembled into individual decision trees to provide an interpretable set of variants and associated risk. 1718 cases who suffered MACE and 4172 controls were obtained from dbGaP. Pathway analysis showed that variants in genes related to vasculogenesis (FDR = 0.024), angiogenesis (FDR = 0.019), and carotid artery disease (FDR = 0.034) were related to risk for on-statin MACE. We identified six gene-variant networks that predicted odds of on-statin MACE. The most elevated risk was found in a small subset of patients carrying variants in <i>COL4A2</i>, <i>TMEM178B</i>, <i>SZT2</i>, and <i>TBXAS1</i> (OR = 4.53, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The RF-IFRS method is a viable method for interpreting complex "black-box" findings from machine-learning. In this study, it identified epistatic networks that could be applied to risk estimation for on-statin MACE. Further study will seek to replicate these findings in other populations.
