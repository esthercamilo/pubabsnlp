Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of alcohol in Chinese and Indians in Singapore.
Â  Interindividual variability in alcohol pharmacokinetics is influenced by a number of factors, including polymorphisms in genes mediating alcohol pharmacology, ethnicity, sex and body size. Several studies have evaluated the population pharmacokinetics of alcohol from breath alcohol measures. None of these studies, however, have evaluated ethnicity and alcohol-metabolizing enzyme genotypes as covariates in their population pharmacokinetic modelling. We aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic model using clinical and genetic factors and to identify covariates that influenced interindividual variability in alcohol clearance and volume of distribution.
