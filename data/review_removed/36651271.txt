The frequency of rs2231142 in <i>ABCG2</i> among Asian subgroups: implications for personalized rosuvastatin dosing.
Statins are widely used medications for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Statin-induced musculoskeletal symptoms are the primary adverse drug events contributing to poor adherence to lipid-lowering therapy. Rosuvastatin is characterized by interindividual differences in systemic exposure among different patient population subgroups. The missense variant <i>Q141K</i> within <i>ABCG2</i>, highly prevalent in some Asian subgroups, results in decreased transporter efflux function and increased exposure to rosuvastatin. We aim to highlight the implications of <i>ABCG2</i> genotype in prescribing rosuvastatin and the ramifications of interpopulation differences in <i>Q141K</i> frequencies in the starting dose of rosuvastatin in major Asian subgroups, using the most recent genetic-based guidelines. The high frequency of <i>Q141K</i> in Filipinos could warrant a lower starting rosuvastatin dose versus non-Filipinos. The <i>Q141K</i> genotype frequencies in Asian subgroups suggest significant interpopulation differences, reinforcing the need to move beyond race-based to genotype-based rosuvastatin dosing.
