Cytochrome p450 part 2: what nurses need to know about the cytochrome p450 family systems.
To provide the best patient care related to medication administration and prescription, an understanding of the specific enzymes is essential. Enzymes affect the metabolizing of most medications that nurses administer and that nurse practitioners and physicians prescribe on a regular basis. More specifically, the most important p450 enzymes in drug metabolism are cytochrome p450 (CYP) 1A2, the CYP2C family, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. In addition, the enzymes are instrumental in the body's reaction to environmental factors, some of which are carcinogens.
