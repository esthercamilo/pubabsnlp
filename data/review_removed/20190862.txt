Pharmacogenetics and personal genomes.
While pharmacogenetics - the correlation of genotype and response to medicines - currently has a small but measurable impact on the prescribing practice of clinicians, the advent of the ;personal genome' is likely to change this significantly. Advances in high-throughput technologies aimed at characterizing human genetic variation, including chip-based genotyping and next-generation sequencing, are poised to provide a flood of information that will affect both pharmacogenetic discovery and pharmacogenetic application in clinical practice. In order for this flood of information to not overwhelm both researchers and clinicians alike, a variety of new and expanded information management tools will be needed, including electronic medical records, bioinformatic algorithms for analyzing sequence data, information management systems for storing, retrieving and interpreting whole-genome sequence data, and pharmacogenetic decision tools for prescribers.
