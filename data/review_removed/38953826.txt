Genetic Variations Affect Chemotherapy Outcomes: A Role of the Spindle-assembly Checkpoint.
Cancer patients suffer from complicated chemotoxicity. Pharmacogenomics can help stratify patients by predicting their response to treatment and susceptibility toward severe side effects. The spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) is an important pathway that is activated by platinum and taxane compounds and plays a crucial role in their cytotoxic activity. This study investigated a SAC component, Budding Uninhibited by Benzimidazoles 3 (BUB3), its expression, and genetic variants in advanced ovarian cancer patients treated with paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy. Among 80 patients, BUB3 expression correlated with chemosensitivity, suggesting its potential as a predictive marker for chemotherapy response. However, high BUB3 expression was associated with a higher risk of poor survival. In addition, genetic polymorphisms in BUB3 (rs11248416 and rs11248419) were significantly linked to chemotherapy-related toxicities, with rs11248416 showing a negative impact on the patient's physical quality of life.
