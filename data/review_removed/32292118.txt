An assessment of patient perspectives on pharmacogenomics educational materials.
<b>Aim:</b> Pharmacogenomics (PGx) holds potential to improve patient treatment; yet, effective patient educational materials are limited. <b>MaterialsÂ & methods:</b> Using a 'think aloud' technique, we sought to understand comprehension and perceptions of a multimedia PGx results packet including a cover letter with QR code to an educational video, brochure and prototype report in the context of PGx case vignettes. <b>Results:</b> The cover letter and video components were viewed less favorably due to excess detail, complex jargon and technology challenges. Recommendations were to enhance comprehension and utility and to customize materials to each patient's medications or disease conditions. <b>Conclusion:</b> Educational materials were revised to improve comprehension and usability, and diminish concerns to better prepare patients to understand the importance of discussing test results with their provider.
