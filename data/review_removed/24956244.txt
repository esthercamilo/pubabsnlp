Warfarin dose requirements in a patient with the CYP2C9*14 allele.
We describe a 64-year-old male of Indian descent with a history of atrial fibrillation who was started on warfarin after hospital admission for acute stroke. He received genotype-guided warfarin dosing as per the standard-of-care at our hospital, with daily dose recommendations provided by the pharmacogenetics service. Genotyping revealed the rare CYP2C9*1/*14 genotype and warfarin insensitive VKORC1Â -1639GG and CYP4F2 433Met/Met genotypes. The patient received an initial warfarin loading dose of 4 mg for 2 days, followed by 2-3 mg/day for the following 11 days. He reached a therapeutic international normalized ratio on day 5, which was maintained over the following week. This report adds to the limited data of the effects of the CYP2C9*14 allele on warfarin dose requirements.
