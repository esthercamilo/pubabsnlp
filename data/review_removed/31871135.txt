Carboxylesterase 1 and Precision Pharmacotherapy: Pharmacogenetics and Nongenetic Regulators.
Carboxylesterase (CES) 1 is the most abundant drug-metabolizing enzyme in human livers, comprising approximately 1% of the entire liver proteome. CES1 is responsible for 80%-95% of total hydrolytic activity in the liver and plays a crucial role in the metabolism of a wide range of drugs (especially ester-prodrugs), pesticides, environmental pollutants, and endogenous compounds. Expression and activity of CES1 vary markedly among individuals, which is a major contributing factor to interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of drugs metabolized by CES1. Both genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to CES1 variability. Here, we discuss genetic polymorphisms, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and copy number variants and nongenetic contributors, such as developmental status, genders, and drug-drug interactions, that could influence CES1 functionality and the PK and PD of CES1 substrates. Currently, the loss-of-function SNP G143E (rs71647871) is the only clinically significant <i>CES1</i> variant identified to date, and alcohol is the only potent CES1 inhibitor that could alter the therapeutic outcomes of CES1 substrate medications. However, G143E and alcohol can only explain a small portion of the interindividual variability in the CES1 function. A better understanding of the regulation of CES1 expression and activity and identification of biomarkers for CES1 function in vivo could lead to the development of a precision pharmacotherapy strategy to improve the efficacy and safety of many CES1 substrate drugs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The clinical relevance of CES1 has been well demonstrated in various clinical trials. Genetic and nongenetic regulators can affect CES1 expression and activity, resulting in the alteration of the metabolism and clinical outcome of CES1 substrate drugs, such as methylphenidate and clopidogrel. Predicting the hepatic CES1 function can provide clinical guidance to optimize pharmacotherapy of numerous medications metabolized by CES1.
