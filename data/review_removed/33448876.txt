North Carolina's multi-institutional pharmacogenomics efforts with the North Carolina Precision Health Collaborative.
The North Carolina Precision Health Collaborative is an interdisciplinary, public-private consortium of precision health experts who strategically align statewide resources and strengths to elevate precision health in the state and beyond. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is a key area of focus for the North Carolina Precision Health Collaborative. Experts from Atrium Health's Levine Cancer Institute, Duke University/Duke Health System, Mission Health and the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill/UNC Health System have collaborated since 2017 to implement strategic PGx initiatives, including basic sciences research, translational research and clinical implementation of germline testing into practice and policy. This institutional profile highlights major PGx programs and initiatives across these organizations and how the collaborative is working together to advance PGx science and implementation.
