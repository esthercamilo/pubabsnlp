Polymorphisms in common antihypertensive targets: Pharmacogenomic implications for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
The idea of personalized medicine came to fruition with sequencing the human genome; however, aside from a few cases, the genetic revolution has yet to materialize. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, and hypertension is a common prelude to nearly all cardiovascular diseases. Thus, hypertension is an ideal candidate disease to apply tenants of personalized medicine to lessen cardiovascular disease. Herein is a survey that visually depicts the polymorphisms in the top eight antihypertensive targets. Although there are numerous genome-wide association studies regarding cardiovascular disease, few studies look at the effects of receptor polymorphisms on drug treatment. With 17,000+ polymorphisms in the combined target proteins examined, it is expected that some of the clinical variability in the treatment of hypertension is due to polymorphisms in the drug targets. Recent advances in techniques and technology, such as high throughput examination of single mutations, structure prediction, computational power for modeling, and CRISPR models of point mutations, allow for a relatively rapid and comprehensive examination of the effects of known and future polymorphisms on drug affinity and effects. As hypertension is easy to measure and has a plethora of clinically viable ligands, hypertension makes an excellent disease to study pharmacogenomics in the lab and the clinic. If the promises of personalized medicine are to materialize, a concerted effort to examine the effects polymorphisms have on drugs is required. A clinician with the knowledge of a patient's genotype can then prescribe drugs that are optimal for treating that specific patient.
