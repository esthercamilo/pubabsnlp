Optimizing drug selection in psychopharmacology based on 40 significant CYP2C19- and CYP2D6-biased adverse drug reactions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are among the most widely prescribed class of drugs in the practice of psychiatry. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and CYP2D6 are established as clinically relevant drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) that influence the pharmacokinetics of SSRIs and may either be grouped as being primarily metabolized by CYP2C19 or CYP2D6. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the primary drug metabolizing pathway for SSRI antidepressants are associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to physiological modulation of organs with the highest gene tissue expression.
