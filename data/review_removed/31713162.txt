Next Generation Sequencing (NGS): A Revolutionary Technology in Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine in Cancer.
Following the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, research in oncology has progressively focused on the sequencing of cancer genomes, with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of oncogenesis and identifying actionable alterations. The development of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) techniques, commercially available since 2006, allowed for a cost- and time-effective sequencing of tumor DNA, leading to a "genomic era" of cancer research and treatment. NGS provided a significant step forward in Personalized Medicine (PM) by enabling the detection of somatic driver mutations, resistance mechanisms, quantification of mutational burden, germline mutations which settled the foundation of a new approach in cancer care. In this chapter we discuss the history, available techniques and applications of NGS in oncology, with a particular referral to the PM approach and the emerging role of the research field of pharmacogenomics.
