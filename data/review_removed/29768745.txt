Personalized healthcare in the era of value-based healthcare.
Medical care in the USA is plagued by high costs, poor quality and fragmented care delivery. In response, new methods of integrated healthcare delivery are needed, including the patient-centered medical home. At the same time, we need to revitalize our approach to the practice of medicine, moving to a personalized approach, even as we increasingly focus on population management. Some aspects of personalized healthcare have the potential to add significant cost to the system, while others can improve value. This article aims to provide an overview of the current healthcare climate, discuss evolving models of care in the era of healthcare reform and describe the increasingly important role of personalized healthcare in this process.
