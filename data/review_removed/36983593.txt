Recent Advances in Psychopharmacology: From Bench to Bedside Novel Trends in Schizophrenia.
Research in the field of psychopharmacology is ongoing to develop novel compounds which can revolutionize the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The concept of bench-to-bedside is a tedious process, transforming the initial research performed in the laboratories into novel treatment options. Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic psychiatric illness with significant morbidity and mortality. SCZ not only presents with psychotic symptoms including hallucinations and delusions but also with negative and cognitive symptoms. The negative symptoms include the diminished ability to express emotions, loss of pleasure, and motivation with minimal social interactions. Conventional antipsychotics primarily target positive symptoms with minimal therapeutic benefits for negative and cognitive symptoms along with metabolic side effects. Researchers have explored novel targets to develop new compounds to overcome the above limitations. The glutamatergic system has provided new hope in treating schizophrenia by targeting negative and cognitive symptoms. Other receptor modulators, including serotonergic, phosphodiesterase, trans-amine-associated receptors, etc., are novel targets for developing new compounds. Future research is required in this field to explore novel compounds and establish their efficacy and safety for the treatment of schizophrenia. Last but not least, pharmacogenomics has effectively utilized genetic information to develop novel compounds by minimizing the risk of failure of the clinical trials and enhancing efficacy and safety.
