The ESF meeting on "The proteomics, epigenetics and pharmacogenetics of pendrin".
Human pendrin (SCL26A4, PDS) is a 780 amino acid integral membrane protein with transport function. It acts as an electroneutral, sodium-independent anion exchanger for a wide range of anions, such as iodide, chloride, formate, bicarbonate, hydroxide and thiocyanate. Pendrin expression was originally described in the thyroid gland, kidney and inner ear. Accordingly, pendrin mutations with reduction or loss of transport function result in thyroid and inner ear abnormalities, manifested as syndromic (Pendred syndrome) and non-syndromic hearing loss with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (ns-EVA). Pendred syndrome, the most common form of syndromic deafness, is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by sensorineural deafness due to inner ear malformations and a partial iodide organification defect that may lead to thyroid goiter. Later, it became evident that not only pendrin loss of function, but also up-regulation could participate in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Indeed, despite the absence of kidney dysfunction in Pendred syndrome patients, evidence exists that pendrin also plays a crucial role in this organ, with a potential involvement in the pathogenesis of hypertension. In addition, recent data underscore the role of pendrin in exacerbations of respiratory distresses including bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pendrin expression in other organs such as mammary gland, testis, placenta, endometrium and liver point to new, underscored pendrin functions that deserve to be further investigated.
