A cost effective RFLP method to genotype Solute carrier organic anion 1B1 (SLCO1B1) c.1929A>C (p.Leu643Phe, rs34671512); a variant with potential effect on rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics.
This study describes a restriction fragment polymorphism protocol for rapidly screening the polymorphism SLCO1B1 c.1929A>C in genomic DNA samples. The polymorphism SLCO1B1 c.1929A>C has been associated with increased activity resulting in increased hepatic uptake of drugs. Currently SLCO1B1 c.1929A>C is genotyped using direct sequencing techniques and 5' nuclease based assays which can be cost prohibiting in resource limited settings. The aim of this study therefore was to design and validate a cost effective RFLP for genotyping the SLCO1B1 c.1929A>C polymorphism. This study was designed to investigate the effect of the polymorphism SLCO1B1 c.1929A>C on interindividual variability in rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers of African descent.
