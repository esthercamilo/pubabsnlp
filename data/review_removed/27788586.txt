Imaging biobanks in oncology: European perspective.
Imaging biobanks as defined by the European Society of Radiology are "organised databases of medical images, and associated imaging biomarkers (radiology and beyond), shared among multiple researchers, linked to other biorepositories". Oncologic imaging biobanks are developed mainly for research purposes. These biobanks may be developed in academic centers, or with the support of industry. The awareness of their importance is gradually increasing in the oncologic community. It is difficult to determine which oncologic domain of research will benefit from the implementation of imaging biobanks. One of the most foreseeable applications could be the correlation between imaging phenotype and genotype. For this reason imaging biobanks should be embedded in wider biobanks networks, as for example the European-based Biobanking and BioMolecular resources Research Infrastructure.
