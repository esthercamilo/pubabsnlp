Impact of <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>VKORC1</i> Polymorphisms on Warfarin Sensitivity and Responsiveness in Jordanian Cardiovascular Patients during the Initiation Therapy.
Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant frequently used in the treatment of different cardiovascular diseases. Genetic polymorphisms in the <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>VKORC1</i> genes have produced variants with altered catalytic properties. A total of 212 cardiovascular patients were genotyped for 17 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within the <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>VKORC1</i> genes. This study confirmed a genetic association of the <i>CYP2C9</i>*3 and <i>VKORC1</i> rs10871454, rs8050894, rs9934438, and rs17708472 SNPs with warfarin sensitivity. This study also found an association between <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>VKORC1</i> genetic haplotype blocks and warfarin sensitivity. The initial warfarin dose was significantly related to the <i>CYP2C9</i>*3 polymorphism and the four <i>VKORC1</i> SNPs (<i>p</i> < 0.001). There were significant associations between rs4086116 SNP and TAT haplotype within <i>CYP2C9</i> gene and rs17708472 SNP and CCGG haplotype within <i>VKORC1</i> gene and warfarin responsiveness. However, possessing a <i>VKORC1</i> variant allele was found to affect the international normalized ratio (INR) outcomes during initiation of warfarin therapy. In contrast, there was a loose association between the <i>CYP2C9</i> variant and INR measurements. These findings can enhance the current understanding of the great variability in response to warfarin treatment in Arabs.
