Genome-Wide and Gene-Based Meta-Analyses Identify Novel Loci Influencing Blood Pressure Response to Hydrochlorothiazide.
This study aimed to identify novel loci influencing the antihypertensive response to hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. A genome-wide meta-analysis of blood pressure (BP) response to hydrochlorothiazide was performed in 1739 white hypertensives from 6 clinical trials within the International Consortium for Antihypertensive Pharmacogenomics Studies, making it the largest study to date of its kind. No signals reached genome-wide significance (P<5×10<sup>-</sup><sup>8</sup>), and the suggestive regions (P<10<sup>-5</sup>) were cross-validated in 2 black cohorts treated with hydrochlorothiazide. In addition, a gene-based analysis was performed on candidate genes with previous evidence of involvement in diuretic response, in BP regulation, or in hypertension susceptibility. Using the genome-wide meta-analysis approach, with validation in blacks, we identified 2 suggestive regulatory regions linked to gap junction protein α1 gene (GJA1) and forkhead box A1 gene (FOXA1), relevant for cardiovascular and kidney function. With the gene-based approach, we identified hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 β- and steroid δ-isomerase 1 gene (HSD3B1) as significantly associated with BP response (P<2.28×10<sup>-<sup>4</sup></sup> ). HSD3B1 encodes the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme and plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of aldosterone and endogenous ouabain. By amassing all of the available pharmacogenomic studies of BP response to hydrochlorothiazide, and using 2 different analytic approaches, we identified 3 novel loci influencing BP response to hydrochlorothiazide. The gene-based analysis, never before applied to pharmacogenomics of antihypertensive drugs to our knowledge, provided a powerful strategy to identify a locus of interest, which was not identified in the genome-wide meta-analysis because of high allelic heterogeneity. These data pave the way for future investigations on new pathways and drug targets to enhance the current understanding of personalized antihypertensive treatment.
