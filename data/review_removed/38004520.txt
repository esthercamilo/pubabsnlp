Pharmacogenetic Guidelines for Psychotropic Drugs: Optimizing Prescriptions in Clinical Practice.
The modalities for prescribing a psychotropic (dose and choice of molecule) are currently unsatisfactory, which can lead to a lack of efficacy of the treatment associated with prolonged exposure of the patient to the symptoms of his or her illness and the side effects of the molecule. In order to improve the quality of treatment prescription, a part of the current biomedical research is dedicated to the development of pharmacogenetic tools for individualized prescription. In this guideline, we will present the genes of interest with level 1 clinical recommendations according to PharmGKB for the two major families of psychotropics: antipsychotics and antidepressants. For antipsychotics, there are <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP3A4</i>, and for antidepressants, <i>CYP2B6</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i>, and <i>CYP2C19</i>. The study will focus on describing the role of each gene, presenting the variants that cause functional changes, and discussing the implications for prescriptions in clinical practice.
