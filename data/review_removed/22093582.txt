Prognostic factors in adult acute leukemia.
The prognostic factors in acute leukemia have undergone a major change over the past decade and are likely to be further refined in the coming years. While age is the single most important prognostic factor in both AML and in ALL, recurring cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular markers have become crucial for the prognosis of patients and for new directions in the development of targeted therapies. No less important is the development of a personalized approach for therapy as determined by the response to therapy using increasingly sensitive technologies. The assessment of MRD is rapidly superseding other prognostic factors in ALL and, somewhat lacking behind, coming into its own in AML. The next decade should see further refinement of response-driven prognostication, to include epigenetics as well as pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics of individual drugs used and the responses to them. It is hoped that these refinements and better predictors of response will also lead to a significantly improved overall outcome of patients with both AML and ALL.
