Organic Cation Transporter 2 (OCT2/SLC22A2) Gene Variation in the South African Bantu-Speaking Population and Functional Promoter Variants.
SLC22A2 facilitates the transport of endogenous and exogenous cationic compounds. Many pharmacologically significant compounds are transported by SLC22A2, including the antidiabetic drug metformin, anticancer agent cisplatin, and antiretroviral lamivudine. Genetic polymorphisms in SLC22A2 can modify the pharmacokinetic profiles of such important medicines and could therefore prove useful as precision medicine biomarkers. Since the frequency of SLC22A2 polymorphisms varies among different ethnic populations, we evaluated these in South African Bantu speakers, a majority group in the South African population, who exhibit unique genetic diversity, and we subsequently functionally characterized promoter polymorphisms. We identified 11 polymorphisms within the promoter and 9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the coding region of SLC22A2. While some polymorphisms appeared with minor allele frequencies similar to other African and non-African populations, some differed considerably; this was especially notable for three missense polymorphisms. In addition, we functionally characterized two promoter polymorphisms; rs138765638, a three base-pair deletion that bioinformatics analysis suggested could alter c-Ets-1/2, Elk1, and/or STAT4 binding, and rs59695691, an SNP that could abolish TFII-I binding. Significantly higher luciferase reporter gene expression was found for rs138765638 (increase of 37%; p = 0.001) and significantly lower expression for rs59695691 (decrease of 25%; p = 0.038), in comparison to the wild-type control. These observations highlight the importance of identifying and functionally characterizing genetic variation in genes of pharmacological significance. Finally, our data for SLC22A2 attest to the importance of considering genetic variation in different populations for drug safety, response, and global pharmacogenomics, through, for example, projects such as the Human Heredity and Health in Africa initiative.
