Pharmacogenetic considerations in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Recently, a lot of progress has been made in the identification of genetic biomarkers of drug response. Efforts to define the role of genetic polymorphisms in optimizing pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's disease were also undertaken. This report presents the current state of knowledge on pharmacogenetics of PD, including genes encoding enzymes involved in drug metabolism, drug transporters and direct targets of antiparkinsonian drugs. In most of cases, available data on pharmacogenetic factors that could turn out to be significant modifiers of therapy with anti-PD drugs is still very incomplete and makes it impossible to reach final conclusion about their usefulness in the clinic. More extensive studies, in more uniform, large patient groups, including genome-wide association studies, should be undertaken to finally confirm or deny the value of genetic tests in PD therapy individualization.
