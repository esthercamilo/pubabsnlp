Improving single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyping accuracy for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase testing in pharmacogenetics.
Fluoropyrimidines, crucial in cancer treatment, often cause toxicity concerns even at standard doses. Toxic accumulation of fluoropyrimidine metabolites, culminating in adverse effects, can stem from impaired dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) enzymatic function. Emerging evidence underscores the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <i>DPYD</i> gene, capable of inducing DPYD activity deficiency. Consequently, <i>DPYD</i> genotyping's importance is on the rise in clinical practice before initiating fluoropyrimidine treatment. Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by Sanger sequencing (SS; PCR-SS) is a prevalent method for <i>DPYD</i> genotyping, it may encounter limitations. In this context, there is reported a case in which a routine PCR-SS approach for genotyping <i>DPYD</i> SNP rs55886062 failed in a proband of African descent. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) categorizes the guanine (G) allele of this SNP as non-functional. The enforcement of whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach led to the identification of two adenine (A) insertions near the PCR primers annealing regions in the proband, responsible for a sequence frameshift and a genotyping error for rs55886062. These SNPs (rs145228578, 1-97981199-T-TA and rs141050810, 1-97981622-G-GA) were extremely rare in non-Finnish Europeans (0.05%) but prevalent in African populations (16%). Although limited evidence was available for these SNPs, they were catalogued as benign variants in public databases. Notably, these two SNPs exhibited a high linkage disequilibrium [LD; squared correlation coefficient (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) = 0.98]. These findings highlighted the importance to consider the prevalence of genetic variants within diverse ethnic populations when designing primers and probes for SNP genotyping in pharmacogenetic testing. This preventive measure is essential to avoid sequence frameshifts or primer misalignments arising from SNP occurrences in the genome, which can compromise PCR-SS and lead to genotyping failures. Furthermore, this case highlights the significance of exploring alternative genotyping approaches, like WGS, when confronted with challenges associated with conventional techniques.
