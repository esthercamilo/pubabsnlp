The clinical validity and utility of combinatorial pharmacogenomics: Enhancing patient outcomes.
Prescribing safe and effective medications is a challenge in psychiatry. While clinical use of pharmacogenomic testing for individual genes has provided some clinical benefit, it has largely failed to show clinical utility. However, pharmacogenomic testing that integrates relevant genetic variation from multiple loci for each medication has shown clinical validity, utility and cost savings in multiple clinical trials. While some challenges remain, the evidence for the clinical utility of "combinatorial pharmacogenomics" is mounting. Expanding education of pharmacogenomic testing is vital to implementation efforts in psychiatric treatment settings with the overall goal of improving medication selection decisions.
