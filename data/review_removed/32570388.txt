Integrating the Comparative Toxicogenomic Database in a Human Pharmacogenomic Resource.
Information relevant to pharmacogenomics studies is available in several open databases, which makes it difficult to synthetize the available data. Within the PractikPharma project, several databases were integrated to PGxLOD, a resource dedicated to the generation and verification of pharmacogenomic influence on drug responses. The Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD) describes the toxic effects of many chemicals on living species based on the literature. Since drugs are peculiar chemicals and side effects are peculiar toxic effects, we aimed at extracting information from CTD that matches drug side effects in the human specie.
