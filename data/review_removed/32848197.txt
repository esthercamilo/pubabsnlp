Pharmacogenetics in clinical practice: current level of knowledge among Flemish physicians and pharmacists.
Over the past decade, pharmacogenetics (PGx) became an essential tool for personalized medicine although its clinical implementation is still limited. We aimed to assess the current level of knowledge, applications, and expectations of Flemish pharmacists and physicians towards PGx and determine the factors that influence healthcare professionals' knowledge of PGx, aiming to guide future implementation initiatives. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from 8 March 2019 to 8 April 2019, targeting pharmacists, physicians, and trainees of both professions. Ten questions were used to assess the participants' knowledge about PGx. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association of profession, experience, practice setting, and prior education with the level of PGx knowledge. In total, 201 Flemish healthcare providers participated, including 100 pharmacists, 73 physicians, and 28 trainees. The majority (78%) of participants were unfamiliar with the basic principles of PGx and its application in clinical practice. The mean percentage of correct answers achieved for the knowledge assessment questions was 34%. Only 9% had counseled patients, while 8% assisted other healthcare professionals on PGx tests the past year. Participants' PGx knowledge was significantly affected by their profession, practice setting, and level of prior education independent of years of experience. These findings provide insight into factors affecting the knowledge of PGx and the current level of PGx implementation in Flemish clinical practice. This may form a basis for developing educational initiatives to enhance the clinical application of PGx in Flanders.
