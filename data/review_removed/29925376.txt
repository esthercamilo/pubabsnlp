Blood pressure signature genes and blood pressure response to thiazide diuretics: results from the PEAR and PEAR-2 studies.
Recently, 34 genes had been associated with differential expression relative to blood pressure (BP)/ hypertension (HTN). We hypothesize that some of the genes associated with BP/HTN are also associated with BP response to antihypertensive treatment with thiazide diuretics.
