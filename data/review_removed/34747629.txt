Frequency and impact of DHODH, ABCG2 and CYP2C19 SNPs on the therapeutic efficacy, tolerability and toxicity of leflunomide.
<b>Introduction:</b> Leflunomide is one of the commonly used drugs in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which on administration is converted into its active metabolite teriflunomide. <b>Aim:</b> Our aim is to evaluate the frequencies of dihydrooroate dehydrogenase (DHODH) (rs3213422), ABCG2 (rs2231142) and CYP2C19 (rs4244285) allele distribution among patients receiving leflunomide for RA and their possible impact on leflunomide performance in disease control. <b>Patients & methods:</b> Patients (>18 years) who fulfilled the 2010 ACR classification criteria for RA receiving leflunomide (20 mg/day) were included in the study. Disease activity score 28 was used to assess patients disease activity. Blood samples were collected for full blood count and blood chemistry. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. The selection of SNPs was based on the criteria of minor allele frequency among Caucasians. <b>Results:</b> A significant association between the therapeutic outcome of leflunomide and DHODH genotyping was observed but not with CYP2C19 and ABCG2. Importantly, there is a significant association between DHODH (rs3213422) CC genotype and the number of patients with controlled disease. <b>Conclusion:</b> We strongly suggest that polymorphisms in the DHODH are the major factor affecting leflunomide pharmacogenetics and therapeutic efficacy.
