Pharmacogenomics of the Natriuretic Peptide System in Heart Failure.
Heart failure (HF) continues to be a public health burden despite advances in therapy, and the natriuretic peptide (NP) system is clearly of critical importance in this setting, spawning valuable diagnostic and prognostic testing, such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), as well as current and future therapeutics, including recombinant natriuretic peptides (e.g., carperitide, nesiritide) and recently sacubitril, which inhibits the key clearance mechanism for NPs. This article intends to summarize the existing evidence for the role of NP system genetic variation on cardiovascular phenotypes relevant to HF with particular focus on the potential impact on pharmacologic therapies.
