Apoptosis and inflammatory genes variants in primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's disease patients.
Anti-TNF therapy has indeed revolutionized the treatment of Crohn's disease, leading to higher rates of response and remission in patients. However, a significant proportion of 20-40% of patients do not respond to the initial therapy, others experience a secondary loss of response with ongoing treatment. Adverse drug reactions also occur in some patients. The effectiveness of anti-TNF treatment may be influenced by genetic variability, including FCGR3A, ADAM17, TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B, FAS, FASL, IL1B, CASP9 , and MIF genes. In this article, we provide an overview of the current knowledge and findings in the pharmacogenetics of anti-TNF drugs in CD focusing on the aspect of apoptosis and inflammatory genes variants in primary non-response. Pharmacogenetic investigations have been conducted to identify genetic markers that can predict response to anti-TNF therapy. However, large multi-center validation studies and multi-loci algorithms development are required to effectively prognose the treatment effect. The identification of predictive markers of response to anti-TNF therapy can help clinicians make informed decisions about treatment options and minimize adverse drug reactions in patients.
