Pharmacist Consult Reports to Support Pharmacogenomics Report Interpretation.
The clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics (PGx) has often involved teams that include pharmacists. PGx laboratories often provide baseline information within the laboratory report that is based on Food and Drug Administration and Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium guidance, but information is often provided independent of concurrent disease states or medication use, among other clinical factors. Major challenges to widescale implementation of PGx include lack of physician experience or confidence in interpreting the data. The purpose of this paper is to describe how pharmacists can help further personalize PGx information and identify clinical recommendations for a given patient.
