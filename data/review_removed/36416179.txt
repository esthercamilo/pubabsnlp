Pharmacogenomics of lipid-lowering agents: the impact on efficacy and safety.
Hyperlipidemia is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. The lipid-lowering drugs are considered the cornerstone of primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, the lack of efficacy and associated adverse effects, ranging from mild-to-moderate to potentially life-threatening, lead to therapy discontinuation. Numerous reports support the role of gene polymorphisms in drugs' pharmacokinetic parameters and their associated adverse reactions. Therefore, this study aims to understand the pharmacogenomics of lipid-lowering drugs and the impact of genetic variants of key genes on the drugs' efficacy and toxicity. Indeed, genetically guided lipid-lowering therapy enhances overall safety, improves drug adherence and achieves long-term therapy.
