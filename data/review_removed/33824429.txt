Genetic variants associated with cardiometabolic abnormalities during treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: a genome-wide association study.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are prescribed both to patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Previous studies have shown associations between SSRI treatment and cardiometabolic alterations. The aim of the present study was to investigate genetic variants associated with cardiometabolic adverse effects in patients treated with SSRIs in a naturalistic setting, using a genome-wide cross-sectional approach in a genetically homogeneous sample. We included and genotyped 1981 individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, of whom 1180 had information available on the outcomes low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), triglycerides, and body mass index (BMI) and investigated interactions between SNPs and SSRI use (N = 246) by conducting a genome-wide GxE analysis. We report 13 genome-wide significant interaction effects of SNPs and SSRI serum concentrations on LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and BMI, located in four distinct genomic loci. This study provides new insight into the pharmacogenetics of SSRI but warrants replication in independent populations.
