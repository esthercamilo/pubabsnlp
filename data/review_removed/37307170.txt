Pharmacogenomic markers of metoprolol and α-OH-metoprolol concentrations: a genome-wide association study.
<b>Aim:</b> Few genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been conducted to identify predictors of drug concentrations. The authors therefore sought to discover the pharmacogenomic markers involved in metoprolol pharmacokinetics. <b>Patients & methods:</b> The authors performed a GWAS of a cross-sectional study of 993 patients from the Montreal Heart Institute Biobank taking metoprolol. <b>Results:</b> A total of 391 and 444 SNPs reached the significance threshold of 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> for metoprolol and α-OH-metoprolol concentrations, respectively. All were located on chromosome 22 at or near the <i>CYP2D6</i> gene, encoding CYP450 2D6, metoprolol's main metabolizing enzyme. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results reinforce previous findings of the importance of the <i>CYP2D6</i> locus for metoprolol concentrations and confirm that large biobanks can be used to identify genetic determinants of drug pharmacokinetics at a GWAS significance level.
