Interethnic differences in drug response: projected impact of genetic variations in the Saudi population.
Ethnicity is known to have an impact on drug responses. This is particularly important for drugs that have a narrow therapeutic window, nonlinearity in pharmacokinetics and are metabolized by enzymes that demonstrate genetic polymorphisms. However, most clinical trials are conducted among Caucasians, which might limit the usefulness of the findings of such studies for other ethnicities. The representation of participants from Saudi Arabia in global clinical trials is low. Therefore, there is a paucity of evidence to assess the impact of ethnic variability in the Saudi population on drug response. In this article, the authors assess the projected impact of genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug targets on drug response in the Saudi population.
