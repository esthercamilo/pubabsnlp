NGS study of glucocorticoid response genes in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
Despite intensive research and a long history of glucocorticoids being applied in various clinical areas, they still generate a challenge for personalized medicine by causing resistance or dependence in nearly 50% of patients treated. The objective of the present study was to determine the genetic predictors of variable reactions in inflammatory bowel disease patients to glucocorticoid therapy. Therefore, based on the current knowledge on how glucocorticoids act, we have compiled a panel of 21 genes for variant analysis: <i>NR3C1</i>, <i>NLRP1</i>, <i>IPO13</i>, <i>FKBP5</i>, <i>HSPA4</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>STIP1</i>, <i>HSP90AA1</i>, <i>IL-1A</i>, <i>IL-1B</i>, <i>IL-2</i>, <i>IL-4</i>, <i>CXCL8</i>, <i>IL-10</i>, <i>NFKBIA</i>, <i>JUN</i>, <i>MIF</i>, <i>TNF</i>, <i>MAPK14</i>, <i>CYP3A4</i>, and <i>CYP3A5</i>.
