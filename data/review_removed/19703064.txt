Impact of pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics on the efficacy of pranlukast in Japanese asthmatics.
Wide inter-individual variability in therapeutic effects limits the efficacy of leukotriene (LT) receptor antagonists in the treatment of asthma. We have reported that genetic variability in the expression of LTC(4) synthase is associated with responsiveness to pranlukast in Japanese asthmatic patients. However, the effects of pharmacokinetic variability are less well known. This was an analysis of the pharmacokinetics of pranlukast in a population of adult asthmatics, and its effect on clinical responses. Other factors that may be related to the therapeutic effects of pranlukast, including LTC(4) synthase gene polymorphisms, were also investigated.
