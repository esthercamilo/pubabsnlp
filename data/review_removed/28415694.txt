Single nucleotide polymorphisms in CIDEC gene are associated with metabolic syndrome components risks and antihypertensive drug efficacy.
The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1053239 and rs2479 of cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c with the risk of metabolic syndrome and its components, and with the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs was investigated. Totally 1064 subjects with metabolic syndrome and 1099 controls of Chinese Han nationality were recruited. Clinical assessment was conducted with medication records collected at baseline and during 5-year follow-up. Carriers of rs2479 A allele were at higher risk to develop elevated fasting glucose than non-carriers (P = 0.004). A allele at rs2479 were associated with a 5-year aggravation of blood triglyceride (P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.003), and C allele at rs1053239 with the exacerbation of systolic (P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.001). Moreover, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of angiotensin II-targeted drugs were higher in subjects with rs2479 A allele or rs1053239 C allele. These findings suggest that carriers of rs2479 A allele are predisposed to the development of increased fasting glucose, and the progressive elevation of blood triglyceride. Individuals with A allele at rs2479 or C allele at rs1053239 are more susceptible to a rapid progression of blood pressure, and benefit more from angiotensin II-targeted therapy.
