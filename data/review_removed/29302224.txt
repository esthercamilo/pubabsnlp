Tobacco use disorder and treatment: new challenges and opportunities.
Tobacco use remains a global problem, and options for consumers have increased with the development and marketing of e-cigarettes and other new nicotine and tobacco products, such as "heat-not-burn" tobacco and dissolvable tobacco. The increased access to these new products is juxtaposed with expanding public health and clinical intervention options, including mobile technologies and social media. The persistent high rate of tobacco-use disorders among those with psychiatric disorders has gathered increased global attention, including successful approaches to individual treatment and organizational-level interventions. Best outcomes occur when medications are integrated with behavioral therapies and community-based interventions. Addressing tobacco in mental health settings requires training and technical assistance to remove old cultural barriers that restricted interventions. There is still "low-hanging fruit" to be gained in educating on the proper use of nicotine replacement medications, how smoking cessation can change blood levels of specific medications and caffeine, and how to connect with quitlines and mobile technology options. Future innovations are likely to be related to pharmacogenomics and new technologies that are human-, home-, and community-facing.
