Synergistic cytotoxicity, inhibition of signal transduction pathways and pharmacogenetics of sorafenib and gemcitabine in human NSCLC cell lines.
Lung cancer is one of the most lethal tumors and, although standard chemotherapy produces clinical response, there has been little improvement in prognosis. Therefore, research effort has focused on target-specific agents, such as sorafenib, which blocks both the RAF/MEK/ERK signalling pathways and receptors involved in neovascularization and tumor progression, including VEGFR-2 and c-Kit. We investigated whether sorafenib would be synergistic with gemcitabine against NSCLC cell lines.
