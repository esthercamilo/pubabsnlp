No genetic associations with mepolizumab efficacy in COPD with peripheral blood eosinophilia.
Improved understanding of genetic effects on response to treatments with novel approaches for COPD with peripheral blood eosinophilia, such as mepolizumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody to IL-5), may improve treatment outcomes. We conducted a study to identify genetic variants associated with efficacy of mepolizumab COPD.
