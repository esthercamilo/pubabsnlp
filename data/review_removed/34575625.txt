Molecular Dysregulation in Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) comprises a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders with a strong heritable genetic component. At present, ASD is diagnosed solely by behavioral criteria. Advances in genomic analysis have contributed to numerous candidate genes for the risk of ASD, where rare mutations and s common variants contribute to its susceptibility. Moreover, studies show rare de novo variants, copy number variation and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) also impact neurodevelopment signaling. Exploration of rare and common variants involved in common dysregulated pathways can provide new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for ASD. Contributions of current innovative molecular strategies to understand etiology of ASD will be explored which are focused on whole exome sequencing (WES), whole genome sequencing (WGS), microRNA, long non-coding RNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 models. Some promising areas of pharmacogenomic and endophenotype directed therapies as novel personalized treatment and prevention will be discussed.
