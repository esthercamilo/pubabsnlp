Genome-based therapeutic interventions for β-type hemoglobinopathies.
For decades, various strategies have been proposed to solve the enigma of hemoglobinopathies, especially severe cases. However, most of them seem to be lagging in terms of effectiveness and safety. So far, the most prevalent and promising treatment options for patients with β-types hemoglobinopathies, among others, predominantly include drug treatment and gene therapy. Despite the significant improvements of such interventions to the patient's quality of life, a variable response has been demonstrated among different groups of patients and populations. This is essentially due to the complexity of the disease and other genetic factors. In recent years, a more in-depth understanding of the molecular basis of the β-type hemoglobinopathies has led to significant upgrades to the current technologies, as well as the addition of new ones attempting to elucidate these barriers. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to shed light on pharmacogenomics, gene addition, and genome editing technologies, and consequently, their potential use as direct and indirect genome-based interventions, in different strategies, referring to drug and gene therapy. Furthermore, all the latest progress, updates, and scientific achievements for patients with β-type hemoglobinopathies will be described in detail.
