Pharmacogenomics: A Practical Primer for Senior Care Pharmacists.
Pharmacogenomics (PGx), the study of how an individual's genetic makeup affects his or her response to drugs, is a fast-growing field that gives health care providers a valuable tool to help safely and effectively manage medication. However, few providers have experience in applying the results of PGx tests to their practices, and this can lead to disregarding the data or unnecessarily modifying medication regimens. Pharmacists are uniquely positioned to become wellversed in the interpretation of PGx data, critically evaluating the "green-yellow-red" result categories that seemingly signal "go, caution, stop" regarding the use of a particular medication. Pharmacists also can evaluate genotype and phenotype information, commonly included in PGx laboratory reports, to optimize therapy. Using a case-based approach, this primer is intended to provide consultant pharmacists with practical direction to aid in PGx interpretation that will provide contextappropriate recommendations that contributes to positive patient outcomes.
