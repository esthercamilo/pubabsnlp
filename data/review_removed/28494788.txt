Comprehensive analysis of treatment response phenotypes in rheumatoid arthritis for pharmacogenetic studies.
An individual patient's response to a particular drug is influenced by multiple factors, which may include genetic predisposition. Pharmacogenetic studies attempt to discover and estimate the contributions of genetic variants to the variability in response to a drug treatment. The task of identifying the genetic contribution is often complicated by response phenotypes that are based on imprecise or subjective clinical observations. Because the success of a pharmacogenetic study depends on the analysis of a heritable phenotype, it is important to identify phenotypes with a significant heritable component to ensure reliable and reproducible results in subsequent genetic association studies.
