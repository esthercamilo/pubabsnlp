PharmoCo: a graph-based visualization of pharmacogenomic plausibility check reports for clinical decision support systems.
The first approaches in recent years for the integration of pharmacogenomic plausibility checks into clinical practice show both a promising improvement in the drug therapy safety, but also difficulties in application. One of the difficulties is the meaningful interpretation of the text-based results by the medical practitioner. We propose here as an appropriate and sensible solution to avoid misunderstandings and to include evidence-based, pharmacogenomic recommendations in prescriptions, which should be the graph-based visualization of the reports. This allows for a plausible interpretation and relate complex, even contradictory guidelines. The improved overview over the pharmacogenomics (PGx) guidelines using the graphical visualization makes the medical practitioner's choice of dose and medication more patient-specific, improves the treatment outcome and thus, increases the drug therapy safety.
