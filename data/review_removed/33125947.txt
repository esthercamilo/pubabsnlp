Pre-therapeutic UGT1A1 genotyping to reduce the risk of irinotecan-induced severe toxicity: Ready for prime time.
Pre-therapeutic UGT1A1 genotyping is not yet routinely performed in most hospitals in patients starting irinotecan chemotherapy. The aim of this position paper was to evaluate the available evidence and to assess the potential value of genotyping of UGT1A1âˆ—28 and UGT1A1*6 in patients before starting treatment with irinotecan to reduce the risk of severe toxicity.
