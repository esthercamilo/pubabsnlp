Allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms of clinically important drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 in a Thai population.
Prior knowledge of allele frequencies of cytochrome P450 polymorphisms in a population is crucial for the revision and optimization of existing medication choices and doses. In the current study, the frequency of the CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2C19*6, CYP2C19*17, and CYP3A4 (rs4646437) alleles in a Thai population across different regions of Thailand was examined. Tests for polymorphisms of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 were performed using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay and CYP2C19 was performed using two different methods; TaqMan SNP genotyping assay and Luminex x Tag V3. The blood samples were collected from 1205 unrelated healthy individuals across different regions within Thailand. Polymorphisms of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 were transformed into phenotypes, which included normal metabolizer (NM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), poor metabolizer (PM), and rapid metabolizers (RM). The CYP2C9 allele frequencies among the Thai population were 0.08% and 5.27% for the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles, respectively. The CYP2C19 allele frequencies among the Thai population were 25.60%, 2.50%, 0.10%, and 1.80% for the CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2C19*6, and CYP2C19*17 alleles, respectively. The allele frequency of the CYP3A4 (rs4646437) variant allele was 28.50% in the Thai population. The frequency of the CYP2C9*3 allele was significantly lower among the Northern Thai population (P < 0.001). The frequency of the CYP2C19*17 allele was significantly higher in the Southern Thai population (P < 0.001). Our results may provide an understanding of the ethnic differences in drug responses and support for the utilization of pharmacogenomics testing in clinical practice.
