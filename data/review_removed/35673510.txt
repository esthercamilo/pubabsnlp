Effects of the <i>TCF7L2</i> and <i>KCNQ1</i> common variant on sulfonylurea response in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: a preliminary pharmacogenetic study.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common chronic condition characterized by high blood glucose levels which is caused by genetic and environmental factors. Currently, pharmacogenomics (PGx) is anticipated to enable the development of personalized treatment in a wide range of health issues.Â Sulfonylureas (SFUs) are among the oral anti-diabetic drugs that are very popular due to their low cost. Genetic variants in <i>transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2</i>) and <i>potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 (KCNQ1)</i> have been reported for altered therapeutic response to sulfonylurea. The aim of the present study is to evaluate any association between common genetic variant of the <i>TCF7L2</i> and <i>KCNQ1</i> (rs7903146 and rs2237892, respectively) and the response to sulfonylurea in a group of Iranian patients for the first time.
