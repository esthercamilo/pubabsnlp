Treatment of lupus nephritis: practical issues in Asian countries.
Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common and severe manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus in Asian patients, and is an important cause of renal failure in Asian countries. Immunosuppressive treatments of LN have evolved over the past few decades and resulted in improvements in patient outcomes. Treatment guidelines have been recently published by rheumatology and nephrology communities in the USA and Europe, but the emphasis was more on patients of African or Hispanic descent and Caucasians. There is increasing evidence that racial and ethnic variations are associated with differences in disease manifestations, pharmacogenomics/kinetics, response to therapy and complications of disease or treatment. There is substantial data confirming the efficacy of combined corticosteroids and either cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as initial treatments for active Class III/IV LN in Asian patients. Azathioprine, MMF or a calcineurin inhibitor, or possibly mizoribine which requires further investigation in non-Japanese patients, in combination with low-dose corticosteroids, can be considered as maintenance immunosuppression to prevent disease flares, and the optimal choice needs to take into account tolerability and prior induction therapy. Treatment costs and accessibility to specialist healthcare facilities, compliance which in turn is related to socio-economic and education status, as well as regional variations in risk of infections, including subacute infection such as tuberculosis or chronic infections such as hepatitis B or C, are issues that are distinctly pertinent in Asia.
