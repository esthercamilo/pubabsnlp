PGWD: Integrating Personal Genome for Warfarin Dosing.
Warfarin is a drug normally used in the prevention of thrombosis and the formation of blood clots. The dosage of warfarin is strongly affected by genetic variants of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes. Current technologies for detecting the variants of these genes are mainly based on real-time PCR. In recent years, due to the rapidly dropping cost of whole genome sequencing and genotyping, more and more people get their whole genome sequenced or genotyped. However, current software for warfarin dosing prediction is based on low-throughput genetic information from either real-time PCR or melting curve methods. There is no bioinformatics tool available that can take the high-throughput genome sequencing data as input and determine the accurate dosage of warfarin. Here, we present PGWD, a web tool that analyzes personal genome sequencing data and integrates with clinical information for warfarin dosing.
