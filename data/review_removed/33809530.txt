PharmaKU: A Web-Based Tool Aimed at Improving Outreach and Clinical Utility of Pharmacogenomics.
With the tremendous advancements in genome sequencing technology in the field of pharmacogenomics, data have to be made accessible to be more efficiently utilized by broader clinical disciplines. Physicians who require the drug-genome interactome information, have been challenged by the complicated pharmacogenomic star-based classification system. We present here an end-to-end web-based pharmacogenomics tool, PharmaKU, which has a comprehensive easy-to-use interface. PharmaKU can help to overcome several hurdles posed by previous pharmacogenomics tools, including input in hg38 format only, while hg19/GRCh37 is now the most popular reference genome assembly among clinicians and geneticists, as well as the lack of clinical recommendations and other pertinent dosage-related information. This tool extracts genetic variants from nine well-annotated pharmacogenes (for which diplotype to phenotype information is available) from whole genome variant files and uses Stargazer software to assign diplotypes and apply prescribing recommendations from pharmacogenomic resources. The tool is wrapped with a user-friendly web interface, which allows for choosing hg19 or hg38 as the reference genome version and reports results as a comprehensive PDF document. PharmaKU is anticipated to enable bench to bedside implementation of pharmacogenomics knowledge by bringing precision medicine closer to a clinical reality.
