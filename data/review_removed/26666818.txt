Breast cancer risk in relation to TP53 codon 72 and CDH1 gene polymorphisms in the Bangladeshi women.
Pharmacogenomic studies play a significant role in understanding the risk of breast cancer where genetic abnormalities are implicated as the etiology of cancer. Various polymorphisms of tumor suppressor gene TP53 and E-cadherin (CDH1) have been found to be associated with increased breast cancer risk worldwide. This study aimed to analyze the contribution of TP53 and CDH1 gene anomalies in breast cancer risk in the Bangladeshi breast cancer patients. For risk determination, 310 patients with breast cancer and 250 controls from Bangladeshi women were recruited who are matched up with age and use of contraceptives with patients. Genetic polymorphisms were detected by using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. A significant association was found between TP53Arg72Pro (rs1042522) and CDH1 -160 C/A (rs16260) polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. In case of P53rs1042522 polymorphism, Arg/Pro (P = 0.0053, odds ratio (OR) = 1.69) and Pro/Pro (P = 0.018, OR = 1.83) genotypes were associated with increased risk of breast cancer in comparison to the Arg/Arg genotype. Arg/Pro + Pro/Pro genotype and Pro allele also increased the risk of breast cancer (P = 0.002, OR = 1.73; P = 0.004, OR = 1.43, respectively). In case of CDH1rs16260 polymorphism, C/A heterozygote and combined C/A + A/A genotypes were found to be strongly associated (P = 0.005, OR = 1.67; P = 0.0037, OR = 1.68) with increased risk of breast cancer. The variant A allele also increased the breast cancer risk (P = 0.0058, OR = 1.52). The present study demonstrates that P53Arg72Pro and CDH1rs16260 polymorphisms are associated with elevated breast cancer risk in the Bangladeshi population.
