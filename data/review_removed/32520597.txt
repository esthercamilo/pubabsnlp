Pharmacogenetic considerations when prescribing cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Cholinergic dysfunction, demonstrated in the late 1970s and early 1980s, led to the introduction of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) in 1993 (Tacrine) to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission as the first line of treatment against Alzheimer's disease (AD). The new generation of AChEIs, represented by Donepezil (1996), Galantamine (2001) and Rivastigmine (2002), is the only treatment for AD to date, together with Memantine (2003). AChEIs are not devoid of side-effects and their cost-effectiveness is limited. An option to optimize the correct use of AChEIs is the implementation of pharmacogenetics (PGx) in the clinical practice.
