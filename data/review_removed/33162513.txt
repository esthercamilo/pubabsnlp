[Genetic basis of subsequent malignant neoplasms].
Subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are one of the most serious late complications in pediatric patients with cancer, with more than 10% of long-term cancer survivors developing SMNs. Germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes have been recently highlighted as a risk factor. For example, germline mutations in the TP53 gene were reported to be a risk factor for SMNs. A comprehensive genomic analysis for a large cohort of long-term survivors of childhood cancer showed that variants in cancer predisposition genes were correlated with the higher cumulative incidence of SMNs. As another genetic risk, previous reports suggested that polymorphisms in genes regulating thiopurine pathway such as TPMT gene might contribute to SMN development after acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. Considering improved survival probability, attention should be paid for late complications. Thus, therapeutic strategy should be optimized based on a risk for SMNs of each individual.
