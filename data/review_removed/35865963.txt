Comprehensive Assessment of Indian Variations in the Druggable Kinome Landscape Highlights Distinct Insights at the Sequence, Structure and Pharmacogenomic Stratum.
India confines more than 17% of the world's population and has a diverse genetic makeup with several clinically relevant rare mutations belonging to many sub-group which are undervalued in global sequencing datasets like the 1000 Genome data (1KG) containing limited samples for Indian ethnicity. Such databases are critical for the pharmaceutical and drug development industry where diversity plays a crucial role in identifying genetic disposition towards adverse drug reactions. A qualitative and comparative sequence and structural study utilizing variant information present in the recently published, largest curated Indian genome database (IndiGen) and the 1000 Genome data was performed for variants belonging to the kinase coding genes, the second most targeted group of drug targets. The sequence-level analysis identified similarities and differences among different populations based on the nsSNVs and amino acid exchange frequencies whereas a comparative structural analysis of IndiGen variants was performed with pathogenic variants reported in UniProtKB Humsavar data. The influence of these variations on structural features of the protein, such as structural stability, solvent accessibility, hydrophobicity, and the hydrogen-bond network was investigated. In-silico screening of the known drugs to these Indian variation-containing proteins reveals critical differences imparted in the strength of binding due to the variations present in the Indian population. In conclusion, this study constitutes a comprehensive investigation into the understanding of common variations present in the second largest population in the world and investigating its implications in the sequence, structural and pharmacogenomic landscape. The preliminary investigation reported in this paper, supporting the screening and detection of ADRs specific to the Indian population could aid in the development of techniques for pre-clinical and post-market screening of drug-related adverse events in the Indian population.
