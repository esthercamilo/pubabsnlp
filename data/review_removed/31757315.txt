Genomics Testing and Personalized Medicine in the Preoperative Setting.
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is the study of how individuals' personal genotypes may affect their responses to various pharmacologic agents. The application of PGx principles in perioperative medicine is fairly novel. Challenges in executing PGx programs into health care systems include physician buy-in and integration into usual clinical workflow, including the electronic health record. This article discusses the current evidence highlighting the potential of PGx with various drug categories (including opioids, nonopioid analgesics, sedatives, β-blockers, antiemetics, and anticoagulants) used in the perioperative process and the challenges of integrating PGx into a health care system and relevant workflows.
