Combined analysis of the moderating effect of a GRIK1 polymorphism on the effects of topiramate for treating alcohol use disorder.
In an initial study, we reported that topiramate reduced heavy drinking among individuals who sought to reduce their drinking and that the effect was moderated by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs2832407) in GRIK1, which encodes the kainate GluK1 receptor subunit (Kranzler et al., 2014). In a subsequent study that prospectively randomized patients to medication group based on their rs2832407 genotype, we replicated the main effect of topiramate but not the moderating effect of the SNP (Kranzler et al., 2021). Given the similar design of the two studies, here we combined the findings to provide greater statistical power to test the pharmacogenetic effect.
