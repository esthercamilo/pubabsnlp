Attitudes of oncology nurses concerning pharmacogenomics.
The field of oncology has been permeated with the use of pharmacogenomics. There have been a few studies on oncology nurses' attitudes surrounding this topic. A study conducted in 2015 revealed six themes: consistency, effectiveness, cost, disparity, genetic counseling needs and need for further education. Further information obtained while conducting a pilot study for continuing education related to pharmacogenomics have revealed novel perspectives surrounding pharmacogenomics among oncology nurses. The previous six themes were substantiated. Additionally, four new themes were identified: change in scope of practice, standardized communication, access to up-to-date information and advocacy. Further validation of the prior six themes and the addition of the new themes reveal the continual impact of pharmacogenomics on nursing practice. The main theme that resounding among the majority of the nurses was the need for further education. This validates the development of educational programs that focus on pharmacogenomics within oncology.
