Label-free genotyping of cytochrome P450 2D6*10 using ligation-mediated strand displacement amplification with DNAzyme-based chemiluminescence detection.
Genotyping of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 2D6*10 (CYP2D6*10) plays an important role in pharmacogenomics, especially in clinical drug therapy of Asian populations. This work reported a novel label-free technique for genotyping of CYP2D6*10 based on ligation-mediated strand displacement amplification (SDA) with DNAzyme-based chemiluminescence detection. Discrimination of single-base mismatch is firstly accomplished using DNA ligase to generate a ligation product. The ligated product then initiates a SDA reaction to produce aptamer sequences against hemin, which can be probed by chemiluminescence detection. The proposed strategy is used for the assay of CYP2D6*10 target and the genomic DNA. The results reveal that the proposed technique displays chemiluminescence responses in linear correlation to the concentrations of DNA target within the range from 1 pM to 1 nM. A detection limit of 0.1 pM and a signal-to-background ratio of 57 are achieved. Besides such high sensitivity, the proposed CYP2D6*10 genotyping strategy also offers superb selectivity, great robustness, low cost and simplified operations due to its label-free, homogeneous, and chemiluminescence-based detection format. These advantages suggest this technique may hold considerable potential for clinical CYP2D6*10 genotyping and association studies.
