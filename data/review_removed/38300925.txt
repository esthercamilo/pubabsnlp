Pharmacogenomics of poor drug metabolism in greyhounds: Canine P450 oxidoreductase genetic variation, breed heterogeneity, and functional characterization.
Greyhounds metabolize cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B11 substrates more slowly than other dog breeds. However, CYP2B11 gene variants associated with decreased CYP2B11 expression do not fully explain reduced CYP2B11 activity in this breed. P450 oxidoreductase (POR) is an essential redox partner for all CYPs. POR protein variants can enhance or repress CYP enzyme function in a CYP isoform and substrate dependent manner. The study objectives were to identify POR protein variants in greyhounds and determine their effect on coexpressed CYP2B11 and CYP2D15 enzyme function. Gene sequencing identified two missense variants (Glu315Gln and Asp570Glu) forming four alleles, POR-H1 (reference), POR-H2 (570Glu), POR-H3 (315Gln, 570Glu) and POR-H4 (315Gln). Out of 68 dog breeds surveyed, POR-H2 was widely distributed across multiple breeds, while POR-H3 was largely restricted to greyhounds and Scottish deerhounds (35% allele frequencies), and POR-H4 was rare. Three-dimensional protein structure modelling indicated significant effects of Glu315Gln (but not Asp570Glu) on protein flexibility through loss of a salt bridge between Glu315 and Arg519. Recombinant POR-H1 (reference) and each POR variant (H2-H4) were expressed alone or with CYP2B11 or CYP2D15 in insect cells. No substantial effects on POR protein expression or enzyme activity (cytochrome c reduction) were observed for any POR variant (versus POR-H1) when expressed alone or with CYP2B11 or CYP2D15. Furthermore, there were no effects on CYP2B11 or CYP2D15 protein expression, or on CYP2D15 enzyme kinetics by any POR variant (versus POR-H1). However, Vmax values for 7-benzyloxyresorufin, propofol and bupropion oxidation by CYP2B11 were significantly reduced by coexpression with POR-H3 (by 34-37%) and POR-H4 (by 65-72%) compared with POR-H1. Km values were unaffected. Our results indicate that the Glu315Gln mutation (common to POR-H3 and POR-H4) reduces CYP2B11 enzyme function without affecting at least one other major canine hepatic P450 (CYP2D15). Additional in vivo studies are warranted to confirm these findings.
