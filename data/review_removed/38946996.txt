Frequency of pharmacogenomic variation and medication exposures among All of Us Participants.
Pharmacogenomics promises improved outcomes through individualized prescribing. However, the lack of diversity in studies impedes clinical translation and equitable application of precision medicine. We evaluated the frequencies of PGx variants, predicted phenotypes, and medication exposures using whole genome sequencing and EHR data from nearly 100k diverse All of Us Research Program participants. We report 100% of participants carried at least one pharmacogenomics variant and nearly all (99.13%) had a predicted phenotype with prescribing recommendations. Clinical impact was high with over 20% having both an actionable phenotype and a prior exposure to an impacted medication with pharmacogenomic prescribing guidance. Importantly, we also report hundreds of alleles and predicted phenotypes that deviate from known frequencies and/or were previously unreported, including within admixed American and African ancestry groups.
