Identification of pharmacogenetic biomarkers for efficacy of cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal mitomycin C in patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases.
Mitomycin C (MMC) is commonly used in patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases (CPM) treated with cytoreductive surgery plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS + HIPEC). MMC requires metabolic activation prior to exert its cytotoxic effect of which the main activating enzymes are NQO1 and POR. However, not all patients are able to activate MMC for example due to polymorphisms in the genes encoding these enzymes. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of NQO1∗2, NQO1∗3, and POR∗28 with the efficacy of CRS + HIPEC with MMC in patients with CPM.
