Constitutional DNA Polymorphisms Associated with the Plasma Imatinib Concentration in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients.
The tyrosine kinase Inhibitor (TKI) imatinib is approved for the treatment of the chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML). Pharmacokinetic studies have highlighted the importance of inter-patient variability on imatinib plasma trough concentrations (ima[C]min). In the OPTIM-imatinib trial, we demonstrated that therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is able to improve the molecular response of CP-CML patients treated with imatinib. Here, we analyzed the constitutional exomes and RNAseq data of these patients. We performed an association analysis between the constitutional genetic variants of the patients and their ima[C]min, measured after 12 weeks of treatment with 400 mg once daily. Using linear regression, we identified 50 SNPs that showed excess heterozygosity depending on the ima[C]min. Ten SNPs were from non-coding sequences, and among the 40 remaining, 30 (from 25 genes) could be split into two categories. The first group of 16 SNPs concerns genes encoding extracellular matrix, cell junction, and membrane proteins. Coincidentally, cell adhesion proteins were also identified by RNA-seq as being overexpressed in patients with high ima[C]min. The other group of 14 SNPs were from genes encoding proteins involved in transcription/translation. Although most of the SNPs are intronic variants (28), we also identified missense (3), synonymous (4), 5'/3' (2), splicing (1), and upstream (4) variants. A haplotype analysis of four genes showed a significant association with high ima[C]min. None of the SNPs were significantly associated with the response. In conclusion, we identified a number of ima[C]min-associated SNPs, most of which correspond to genes encoding proteins that could play a role in the diffusion and transit of imatinib through membranes or epithelial barriers.
