Recent progress and clinical importance on pharmacogenetics in cancer therapy.
Recent advances have provided unprecedented opportunities to identify prognostic and predictive markers of efficacy of cancer therapy. Genetic markers can be used to exclude patients who will not benefit from therapy, exclude patients at high risk of severe toxicity and adjust dosing. Genomic approaches for marker discovery now include genome-wide association studies and tumor DNA sequencing. The challenge is now to select markers for which there is enough evidence to transition them to the clinic. The hurdles include the inherent low frequency of many of these markers, the lengthy validation process through trials, as well as legislative and economic hurdles. Attempts to answer questions about certain markers more quickly have led to an increased popularity of trials with enrichment design, especially in light of the dramatic phase I results seen in recent months. Personalized medicine in oncology is a step closer to reality.
