Conference Scene: Pharmacogenomics at the second PharmSciFair 2009: adverse drug reactions and clinical implementation.
From 8th to 12th June 2009, the second PharmSciFair took place in Nice, France. Sessions were organized on different types of pharmaceutical research. Two pharmacogenomics sessions were organized by the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences Network on Research in Pharmacogenetics/Pharmacogenomics. The topics of the sessions were adverse drug reactions and clinical implementation. Important conclusions of the presentations were that there has been much progress in the field of pharmacogenomics and that implementation in clinical practice is not as easy as it was once thought. Large prospective trials might be necessary to prove clinical relevance.
