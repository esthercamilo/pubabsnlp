Functional in vitro characterization of SLCO1B1 variants and simulation of the clinical pharmacokinetic impact of impaired OATP1B1 function.
Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1 is important to the hepatic elimination and distribution of many drugs. If OATP1B1 function is decreased, it can increase plasma exposure of e.g. several statins leading to increased risk of muscle toxicity. First, we examined the impact of three naturally occurring rare variants and the frequent SLCO1B1 c.388A>G variant on in vitro transport activity with cellular uptake assay using two substrates: 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) and rosuvastatin. Secondly, LC-MS/MS based quantitative targeted absolute proteomics measured the OATP1B1 protein abundance in crude membrane fractions of HEK293 cells over-expressing these single nucleotide variants. Additionally, we simulated the effect of impaired OATP1B1 function on rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics to estimate the need for genotype-guided dosing. R57Q impaired DCF and rosuvastatin transport significantly yet did not change protein expression considerably, while N130D and N151S did not alter activity but increased protein expression. R253Q did not change protein expression but reduced DCF uptake and increased rosuvastatin K<sub>m</sub>. Based on pharmacokinetic simulations, doses of 30 mg (with 50% OATP1B1 function) and 20 mg (with 0% OATP1B1 function) result in plasma exposure similar to 40 mg dose (with 100% OATP1B1 function). Therefore dose reductions might be considered to avoid increased plasma exposure caused by function-impairing OATP1B1 genetic variants, such as R57Q.
