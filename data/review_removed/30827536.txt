Surfactant protein A and D polymorphisms and methylprednisolone pharmacogenetics in donor lungs.
Surfactant proteins A and D are important molecules involved in lung allograft innate immunity. Genetic polymorphisms of surfactant proteins A and D are associated with various lung diseases. In this study, surfactant protein A and D expression responses were investigated during pharmacogenetics upon methylprednisolone treatment as observed during lung transplantation.
