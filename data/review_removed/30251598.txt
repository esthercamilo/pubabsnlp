Effects of aripiprazole on pupillometric parameters related to pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics after single oral administration to healthy subjects.
Pupillometry is used for the detection of autonomic dysfunction related to numerous diseases and drug administration. Genetic variants in cytochrome P450 ( CYP2D6, CYP3A4), dopamine receptor ( DRD2, DRD3), serotonin receptor ( HTR2A, HTR2C) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily B ( ABCB1) genes were previously associated with aripiprazole response.
