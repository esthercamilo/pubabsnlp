Investigation of inherited noncoding genetic variation impacting the pharmacogenomics of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment.
Defining genetic factors impacting chemotherapy failure can help to better predict response and identify drug resistance mechanisms. However, there is limited understanding of the contribution of inherited noncoding genetic variation on inter-individual differences in chemotherapy response in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here we map inherited noncoding variants associated with treatment outcome and/or chemotherapeutic drug resistance to ALL cis-regulatory elements and investigate their gene regulatory potential and target gene connectivity using massively parallel reporter assays and three-dimensional chromatin looping assays, respectively. We identify 54 variants with transcriptional effects and high-confidence gene connectivity. Additionally, functional interrogation of the top variant, rs1247117, reveals changes in chromatin accessibility, PU.1 binding affinity and gene expression, and deletion of the genomic interval containing rs1247117 sensitizes cells to vincristine. Together, these data demonstrate that noncoding regulatory variants associated with diverse pharmacological traits harbor significant effects on allele-specific transcriptional activity and impact sensitivity to antileukemic agents.
