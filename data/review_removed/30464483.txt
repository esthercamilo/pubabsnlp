Association study between <i>COMT</i>, <i>DRD2</i>, and <i>DRD3</i> gene variants and antipsychotic treatment response in Mexican patients with schizophrenia.
The efficacy of schizophrenia treatments using antipsychotics (APs) has long been established, but the benefit obtained by several patients using conventional APs (typical or atypical) has not been enough. Currently, the genetic study of the primary mechanisms of action of the APs has been focused on the dopaminergic pathways. The objective of this study was to determine if the response phenotypes (responder, resistance to treatment, and ultra-resistance to treatment groups) are associated with six single-nucleotide polymorphisms: <i>COMT</i> (Val158Met), <i>DRD2</i> (A-241G, C376G, C939T, Taq1A), and <i>DRD3</i> (Ser9Gly).
