Institutional profile of pharmacogenetics within University of Michigan College of Pharmacy.
The University of Michigan College of Pharmacy has made substantial investment in the area of pharmacogenomics to further bolster its activity in pharmacogenomics research, implementation and education. Four tenure-track faculty members have active research programs that focus primarily on the discovery of functional polymorphisms (HJ Zhu), and genetic associations with treatment outcomes in patients with cancer (DL Hertz), cardiovascular disease (JA Luzum) and psychiatric conditions (VL Ellingrod). Recent investments from the University and the College have accelerated the implementation of pharmacogenetics broadly across the institution and in targeted therapeutic areas. Students within the PharmD and other health science professions receive substantial instruction in pharmacogenomics, in preparation for careers in biomedical health in which they can contribute to the generation, dissemination and utilization of pharmacogenomics knowledge to improve patient care.
