Pharmacogenetic testing in pediatric neurology: a pragmatic study evaluating clinician and patient perceptions.
<b>Aim:</b> To evaluate clinicians' and patients' perceptions of pharmacogenetic testing in a clinical setting. <b>Materials & methods:</b> This is a pragmatic mixed-methodÂ prospective observational study. Hospital pharmacists and neurologists participated in focus groups regarding pharmacogenetic testing; patients who received pharmacogenetic testing and their community pharmacists completed surveys to assess their perception of these tests. <b>Results:</b> Most study participants had a positive view of pharmacogenetic testing. Three major themes were identified from the focus groups: receptiveness to pharmacogenetic testing, pharmacogenetic test characteristics and integrating pharmacogenetic tests into practice. <b>Conclusion:</b> The views reported are encouraging for the eventual implementation of pharmacogenetics in practice. Local integration of these tests is an essential step to improve patient care through personalized medicine.
