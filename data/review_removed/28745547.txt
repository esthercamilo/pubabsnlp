Pharmacogenetics may influence the impact of inflammation on voriconazole trough concentrations.
How pharmacogenetics modulates the inhibitory effects of inflammation on voriconazole trough concentration (Cmin) remains unknown. In 29 recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation retrospectively studied, both a genetic score (which aggregated CYP2C19 and CYP3A genotypes) and inflammation significantly influenced voriconazole Cmin (n = 260). A trend toward (p = 0.03) a greater impact of inflammation in patients with the highest genetic score (corresponding to ultra-rapid metabolizers) was observed. Further researches are needed to confirm these data.
