Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity in the era of pharmacogenomics.
Development of advanced and high-throughput methods to study variability in human genes means we can now use pharmacogenomic analysis not only to predict response to treatment but also to assess the toxic action of drugs on normal cells (so-called toxicogenomics). This technological progress could enable us to identify individuals at high and low risk for a given side-effect. Pharmacogenomics could be very useful for stratification of cancer patients at risk of developing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity, one of the most severe and potentially permanent non-haematological side-effects of modern chemotherapeutic agents. However, study data reported so far are inconsistent, which suggests that methodological improvement is needed in clinical trials to obtain reliable results in this clinically relevant area.
