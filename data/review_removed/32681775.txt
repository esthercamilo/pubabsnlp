Self-estimation of phenylketonuria patients on therapeutic diet. Psychological support.
Objectives Self-esteem is the degree to which the qualities and characteristics contained in one's self-concept are perceived to be positive. The aim of this study was to evaluate the self-esteem scores in phenylketonuria (PKU) patients on "strict", "loos" and "off diet". Sixty PKU patients were divided in three equal groups. Methods Group a: "on strict", group b: "on loos" and group c: "off diet". A special questionnaire for self-esteem scores was created for these patients. Results Before psychological support, group a patients demonstrated 6/20 (30%) very high self-esteem, 9/20 (45%) high and 5/25 (25%) moderate. After support 14/20 (70%) were turned to very high, 5/20 (25%) represented high except one whose degrees remained an altered. group b 4/20 (20%) were very high, 7/20 (35%) were high, 3/20 (15%) moderate and the rest of them showed low self-esteem degrees, after support, 10/20 (50%) showed very high, 5/20 (25%) became high, 3/20 (15%) turned to moderate and 2/20 (10%) remained unaltered. Group c, 1/20 (5%) were very high self-esteemed, 7/20 (35%) were high, 6/20 (30%) were moderate and 6/20 (30%) with low self-esteemed, at the end of support, 6/20 (30%) become very high, 8/20 (40%) with high, 4/20 (20.0%), moderate self-esteem whereas the rest were unaltered. Conclusions Very high and high self-esteem degrees were demonstrated in patients who follow their PKU diet. Moderate and low self-esteem degrees were predominantly found in patients on loos and or off diet. Psychological supports commonly result in amelioration of self-esteem degrees.
