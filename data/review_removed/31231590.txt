The influence of <i>SLC22A1</i> rs622342 and <i>ABCC8</i> rs757110 genetic variants on the efficacy of metformin and glimepiride combination therapy in Egyptian patients with type 2 diabetes.
<b>Background:</b> The incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in Egypt is considered one of the highest in the world. Metformin and Sulfonylureas are usually prescribed together due to their efficacy and their relatively low cost. Organic cation transport 1, encoded by <i>SLC22A1</i> gene, is the main transporter of metformin into hepatocytes, which is considered metformin site of action. Sulfonylureas enhance insulin release from pancreatic <i>B-</i>cells through binding to sulfonylurea receptor 1, encoded by <i>ABCC8</i> gene. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the <i>SLC22A1</i> and <i>ABCC8</i> genes might affect the response of each drug. <b>Aims:</b> To investigate the influence of <i>SLC22A1</i> rs622342 (A>C) and <i>ABCC8</i> rs757110 (A>C) genetic variants on the efficacy of metformin and glimepiride combination therapy in Egyptian T2DM patients. <b>Methods:</b> Observational cross-sectional study in which patients receiving metformin and glimepiride combination therapy for at least 6 months were included for genotyping and classified into either responders or non-responders, based on their HbA1C level. <b>Results:</b> A total of 127 patients were included and genotyped. They were divided into 93 responders (HbA1C<7%) and 34 non-responders (HbA1C≥7%). Minor allele frequencies for rs622342 and rs757110 were 0.189 and 0.271, respectively. Only <i>SLC22A1</i> rs622342 variant was found to be associated with the response of combination therapy, in which AA alleles carriers were 2.7-times more responsive to metformin than C allele carriers (Recessive model, odds ratio = 2.718, <i>p</i> = 0.025, 95% CI = 1.112-6.385). <b>Conclusion:</b> Genotyping of rs622342 can be useful in predicting the response to metformin in combination therapy in Egyptian T2DM patients.
