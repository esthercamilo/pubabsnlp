The ANKK1/DRD2 gene TaqIA polymorphism (rs1800497) is associated with the severity of extrapyramidal side effects of haloperidol treatment in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are one of the most prominent side effects of haloperidol. Variability of EPS severity may be associated with the genetic factors, affecting both haloperidol pharmacokinetics (e.g., CYP2D6) and pharmacodynamics (e.g., DRD2, ANKK1). We conducted a 3-week prospective study to investigate the associations of ANKK1/DRD2 TaqIA (rs1800497), DRD2Â -141C Ins/Del (rs1799732) polymorphisms and CYP2D6 metabolic phenotype on the efficacy of haloperidol treatment and severity of EPS in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.
