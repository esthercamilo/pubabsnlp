<i>UGT1A1</i> (TA)<sub>n</sub> Promoter Genotype: Diagnostic and Population Pharmacogenetic Marker in Serbia.
The UGT1A1 enzyme is involved in the metabolism of bilirubin and numerous medications. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, commonly presented as Gilbert syndrome (GS), is a result of decreased activity of the UGT1A1 enzyme, variable number of TA repeats in the promoter of the <i>UGT1A1</i> gene affects enzyme activity. Seven and eight TA repeats cause a decrease of UGT1A1 activity and risk GS alleles, while six TA repeats contribute to normal UGT1A1 activity and non-risk GS allele. Also, the <i>UGT1A1</i> (TA)<sub>n</sub> promoter genotype is recognized as a clinically relevant pharmacogenetic marker. The aim of this study was to assess diagnostic value of <i>UGT1A1</i> (TA)<sub>n</sub> promoter genotyping in pediatric GS patients. Correlation of the <i>UGT1A1</i> (TA)<sub>n</sub> genotypes and level of unconjugated bilirubin at diagnosis and after hypocaloric and phenobarbitone tests in these patients was analyzed. Another aim of the study was to assess pharmacogenetic potential of <i>UGT1A1</i> (TA)<sub>n</sub> variants in Serbia. Fifty-one pediatric GS patients and 100 healthy individuals were genotyped using different methodologies, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by acrylamide electrophoresis, fragment length analysis and/or DNA sequencing. Concordance of the <i>UGT1A1</i> (TA)<sub>n</sub> promoter risk GS genotypes with GS was found in 80.0% of patients. Therefore, <i>UGT1A1</i> (TA)<sub>n</sub> promoter genotyping is not a reliable genetic test for GS, but it is useful for differential diagnosis of diseases associated with hyperbilirubinemia. Level of bilirubin in pediatric GS patients at diagnosis was <i>UGT1A1</i> (TA)<sub>n</sub> promoter genotype-dependent. We found that the frequency of pharmacogenetic relevant <i>UGT1A1</i> (TA)<sub>n</sub> promoter genotypes was 63.0%, pointing out that <i>UGT1A1</i> (TA)<sub>n</sub> promoter genotyping could be recommended for preemptive pharmacogenetic testing in Serbia.
