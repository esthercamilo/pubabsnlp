Clinical problems in patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Multiple Chemical Sensitivity undergoing total thyroidectomy.
Clinical practice sometimes brings to face with situations quite peculiar, potentially dangerous for the patient's life. In the great majority of cases, pathologies associated with each other (cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological), while in other cases we can treat rare diseases or syndromes. It's considered exceptional the simultaneous presence of "rare" pathologies in a single patient. This exceptionality has been a push to treat a patient as a "unique" asking for help to deeper studies of pharmacogenetics. Our case reports the management of a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), undergoing a total thyroidectomy. We found several problems, and we tried to find effective solutions for the management of the patient during the whole peri-operative process, from a clinical, pharmacological and also from a surgical point of view.
