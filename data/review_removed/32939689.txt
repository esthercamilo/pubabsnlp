Evaluation of Voriconazole CYP2C19 Phenotype-Guided Dose Adjustments by Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling.
Controversy exists regarding dose adjustment in patients treated with voriconazole due to the severity of the infections for which it is prescribed. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) recommends a 50% dose increase or decrease for cytochrome P450 (CYP)Â 2C19 ultrarapid (UM) or poor (PM) metabolizers, respectively. In contrast, for the previous phenotypes, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) voriconazole guideline only recommends a change of treatment. Based on observed data from single-dose bioequivalence studies and steady-state observed concentrations, we aimed to investigate voriconazole dose adjustments by means of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling.
