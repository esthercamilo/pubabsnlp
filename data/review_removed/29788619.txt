Increased carrier prevalence of deficient CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 alleles in depressed patients referred to a tertiary psychiatric hospital.
This study compared the types and carrier prevalences of clinically significant DNA polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) genes CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 in major depressive disorder patients with a control group of nonpsychiatrically ill, medical outpatients.
