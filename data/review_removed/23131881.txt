No significant association between genetic variants in 7 candidate genes and response to methylphenidate treatment in adult patients with ADHD.
Results from pharmacogenetic investigations of methylphenidate (MPH) response in patients with ADHD are still inconsistent, especially among adults. This study investigates the role of genetic variants (SLC6A4, HTR1B, TPH2, DBH, DRD4, COMT, and SNAP25) in the response to MPH in a sample of 164 adults. Genes were chosen owing to previous evidence for an influence in ADHD susceptibility. No significant differences in allele or genotype frequencies between MPH responders and nonresponders were detected. In conclusion, our findings do not support an effect of these genes in the pharmacogenetics of MPH among adults with ADHD.
