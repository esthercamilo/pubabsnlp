Genetic variation in the 3'-UTR of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, NR1I2, and UGT2B7: potential effects on regulation by microRNA and pharmacogenomics relevance.
Pharmacogenomics research has concentrated on variation in genes coding for drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters and nuclear receptors. However, variation affecting microRNA could also play a role in drug response. This project set out to investigate potential microRNA target sites in 11 genes and the extent of variation in the 3'-UTR of six selected genes; CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, NR1I2, and UGT2B7.
