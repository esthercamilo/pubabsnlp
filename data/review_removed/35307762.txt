Pharmacoepigenetics in type 2 diabetes: is it clinically relevant?
Data generated over nearly two decades clearly demonstrate the importance of epigenetic modifications and mechanisms in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. However, the role of pharmacoepigenetics in type 2 diabetes is less well established. The field of pharmacoepigenetics covers epigenetic biomarkers that predict response to therapy, therapy-induced epigenetic alterations as well as epigenetic therapies including inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes. Not all individuals with type 2 diabetes respond to glucose-lowering therapies in the same way, and there is therefore a need for clinically useful biomarkers that discriminate responders from non-responders. Blood-based epigenetic biomarkers may be useful for this purpose. There is also a need for a better understanding of whether existing glucose-lowering therapies exert their function partly through therapy-induced epigenetic alterations. Finally, epigenetic enzymes may be drug targets for type 2 diabetes. Here, I discuss whether pharmacoepigenetics is clinically relevant for type 2 diabetes based on studies addressing this topic.
