Role of SLCO1B1, ABCB1, and CHRNA1 gene polymorphisms on the efficacy of rocuronium in Chinese patients.
This study explored the role of SLCO1B1, ABCB1, and CHRNA1 gene polymorphisms on the efficacy and duration of action of rocuronium in Chinese patients. Two hundred seven unrelated Chinese patients scheduled for elective surgery were recruited, and 200 completed the study. Their ABCB1, SLCO1B1, and CHRNA1 genotypes were determined. Demographic and clinical non-genetic data also were collected. The SLCO1B1, ABCB1, and CHRNA1 variants did not affect the onset time of rocuronium. Clinical duration and recovery time of rocuronium were prolonged in patients with the ABCB1 rs1128503TT and SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AG and GG genotypes. We demonstrate that the SLCO1B1 and ABCB1 gene variants could affect the pharmacodynamics of rocuronium. The ABCB1 rs1128503 C>T genotype was the most important factor on the efficacy of rocuronium.
