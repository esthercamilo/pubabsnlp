Pharmacoresistant Severe Mental Health Disorders in Children and Adolescents: Functional Abnormalities of Cytochrome P450 2D6.
Severe mental health disorders in children and adolescents represent a major public health problem. Despite adequate drug treatment, some patients develop pharmacoresistant disease. As a consequence, physicians are confronted with prescribing challenges, prolonged hospitalization and increased risk of adverse events, thus aggravating short-, medium-, and long-term prognosis. The majority of psychotropic treatments, particularly antipsychotics and antidepressants, are metabolized at hepatic level by cytochrome P450 (CYP), particularly by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Several <i>CYP2D6</i> genetic polymorphisms are described to be associated with ultrarapid (UM) or poor drug metabolism (PM), inducing clinical resistance and/or adverse events, and might therefore be related to pharmacoresistant severe mental health disease.
