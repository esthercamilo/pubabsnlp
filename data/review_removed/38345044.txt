Therapeutic drug monitoring of imatinib - how far are we in the leukemia setting?
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized survival rates of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and replaced hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hSCT) as the key treatment option for these patients. More recently, the so-called Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) ALL has similarly benefitted from TKIs. However, many patients shift from the first generation TKI, imatinib, due to treatment-related toxicities or lack of treatment efficacy. A more personalized approach to TKI treatment could counteract these challenges and potentially be more cost-effective. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has led to higher response rates and less treatment-related toxicity in adult CML but is rarely used in ALL or in childhood CML.
