Investigation of Genetic Variations of <i>IL6</i> and <i>IL6R</i> as Potential Prognostic and Pharmacogenetics Biomarkers: Implications for COVID-19 and Neuroinflammatory Disorders.
In the present study, we investigated the distribution of genetic variations in <i>IL6</i> and <i>IL6R</i> genes, which may be employed as prognostic and pharmacogenetic biomarkers for COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases. The study was performed on 271 samples representative of the Italian general population and identified seven variants (rs140764737, rs142164099, rs2069849, rs142759801, rs190436077, rs148171375, rs13306435) in <i>IL6</i> and five variants (rs2228144, rs2229237, rs2228145, rs28730735, rs143810642) within <i>IL6R</i>, respectively. These variants have been predicted to affect the expression and binding ability of IL6 and IL6R. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) showed that IL6 and IL6R appeared to be implicated in several pathogenetic mechanisms associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality as well as with neurodegenerative diseases mediated by neuroinflammation. Thus, the availability of <i>IL6</i>-<i>IL6R</i>-related biomarkers for COVID-19 may be helpful to counteract harmful complications and prevent multiorgan failure. At the same time, <i>IL6</i>-<i>IL6R</i>-related biomarkers could also be useful for assessing the susceptibility and progression of neuroinflammatory disorders and undertake the most suitable treatment strategies to improve patients' prognosis and quality of life. In conclusion, this study showed how IL6 pleiotropic activity could be exploited to meet different clinical needs and realize personalized medicine protocols for chronic, age-related and modern public health emergencies.
