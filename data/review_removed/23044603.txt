Pharmacogenetics of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
With the beginning of the Human Genome Project, an emerging field of science was brought to the forefront of the pharmaceutical community. Pharmacogenetics facilitates optimization of the current patient-centered care model and pharmacotherapy as a whole. Utilizing these ever-expanding branches of science to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can provide novel opportunities to affect patient care. With a wide range of NSAID choices available as treatment options for relieving pain and/or reducing inflammation or fever, a more systematic way of selecting the ideal agent for the patients based upon their genetic information could spare them from a potentially permanent health-care condition. Furthermore, if a patient possesses or lacks certain alleles, serious adverse events can be anticipated and avoided. The tailoring of drug therapy can be achieved using the published data and cutting-edge genetic testing to attain a higher standard of care for patients.
