β<sub>2</sub> -Adrenergic Receptor Gene Affects the Heart Rate Response of β-Blockers: Evidence From 3 Clinical Studies.
β-Blockers' heart rate (HR)-lowering effect is an important determinant of the effectiveness for this class of drugs, yet it is variable among β-blocker-treated patients. To date, genetic studies have revealed several genetic signals associated with HR response to β-blockers. However, these genetic signals have not been consistently replicated across multiple independent cohorts. Here we sought to use data from 3 hypertension clinical trials to validate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with the HR response to β-blockers. Using linear regression analysis, we investigated the effects of 6 SNPs in 3 genes, including ADRB1, ADRB2, and GNB3, relative to the HR response following β-blocker used in the PEAR (n = 757), PEAR-2 (n = 368), and INVEST (n = 1401) trials, adjusting for baseline HR, age, sex, and ancestry. Atenolol was used in PEAR and INVEST, and metoprolol was used in PEAR-2. We found that rs1042714 and rs1042713 in ADRB2 were significantly associated with HR response to both β-blockers in whites (rs1042714 C-allele carriers, meta-analysis β = -0.95 beats per minute [bpm], meta-analysis P = 3×10<sup>-4</sup> ; rs1042713 A-allele carriers, meta-analysis β = -1.15 bpm, meta-analysis P = 2×10<sup>-3</sup> ). In conclusion, the results of our analyses provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that rs1042714 and rs1042713 in the ADRB2 gene are important predictors of HR response to cardioselective β-blockade in hypertensive patient cohorts.
