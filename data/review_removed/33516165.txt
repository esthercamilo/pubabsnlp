Research projects in human genetics in Switzerland: analysis of research protocols submitted to cantonal ethics committees in 2018.
This analysis provides a full national overview of genetic research dossiers pertaining to clinical and nonclinical trials, and to further-use research projects submitted for approval to ethics committees in Switzerland in 2018. It addresses the research type, medical field, number of individuals or datasets involved, diagnostic laboratories and data privacy, as well as the procedures foreseen for obtaining consent, communicating results, and dealing with excess data and incidental findings. The analysis results should constitute a basis for future discussions surrounding regulatory and ethical procedures that govern genetic investigations in biomedical research in Switzerland.
