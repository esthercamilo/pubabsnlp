Influence of CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 combined genotypes on tacrolimus dose requirements in Egyptian renal transplant patients.
Tacrolimus is a widely prescribed immunosuppressant agent for kidney transplantation. However, optimal dosing is challenging due to its narrow therapeutic index, potentially serious adverse effects, and wide inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics. Cytochrome P450 3A (CPY3A) enzymes metabolize tacrolimus, so allelic variants such as CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 may contribute to individual differences in pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of tacrolimus. This study assessed the frequency and influences of CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 genotypes, alone and combined, on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and dose requirements in Egyptian kidney transplant patients.
