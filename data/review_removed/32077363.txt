Opinion, experience and educational preferences concerning pharmacogenomics: an exploratory study of Quebec pharmacists.
<b>Aim:</b> To evaluate the current opinion, experience and educational preferences of pharmacists in Quebec concerning pharmacogenomics. <b>Method:</b> A web-based survey containing 25 questions was sent to all Quebec pharmacists. <b>Results:</b> Most pharmacists were willing to advise patients (81%) and physicians (84%) on treatment choices based on pharmacogenomic test results after proper training. Only 31% had been previously exposed to pharmacogenomic test results, and 91% were favorable to pharmacogenomics training, with e-learning through interactive video sessions (69%). The preferred training session length was between 1 and 3 h (59%). Hospital pharmacists were more often exposed to pharmacogenomic tests (p < 0.0001) and more frequently advised patients on treatment choices (p < 0.001) than community pharmacists. <b>Conclusion:</b> Pharmacists remain favorable toward pharmacogenomics, but its use in clinical practice stays limited. Identifying the educational preferences of pharmacists may help in the development of educational programs to help them integrate pharmacogenomics in their clinical practice.
