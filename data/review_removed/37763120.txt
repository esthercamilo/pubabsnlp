Pharmacogenetic Variants Associated with Fluoxetine Pharmacokinetics from a Bioequivalence Study in Healthy Subjects.
Fluoxetine is one of the most prescribed antidepressants, yet it still faces challenges due to high intersubject variability in patient response. Mainly metabolized by the highly polymorphic gene <i>CYP2D6</i>, important differences in plasma concentrations after the same doses are found among individuals. This study investigated the association of fluoxetine pharmacokinetics (PK) with pharmacogenetic variants. A bioequivalence crossover trial (two sequences, two periods) was conducted with fluoxetine 20 mg capsules, in 24 healthy subjects. Blood samples for fluoxetine determination were collected up to 72 h post-dose. Subjects were genotyped and single nucleotide variants (SNV) were selected using a candidate gene approach, and then associated with the PK parameters. Bioequivalence was confirmed for the test formulation. We found 34 SNV on 10 genes with a quantifiable impact on the PK of fluoxetine in the randomized controlled trial. Out of those, 29 SNVs belong to 7 CYPs (<i>CYP1A2</i>, <i>CYP2B6</i>, <i>CYP2C9</i>, <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i>, <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>), and 5 SNVs to 3 genes impacting the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of fluoxetine (<i>SLC6A4</i>, <i>TPH1</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>). Moreover, decreased/no function SNVs of <i>CYP2D6</i> (rs1065852, rs28371703, rs1135840) and <i>CYP2C19</i> (rs12769205) were confirmed phenotypically. Our research contributes to deepening the catalog of genotype-phenotype associations in pharmacokinetics, aiming to increase pharmacogenomics knowledge for rational treatment schemes of antidepressants.
