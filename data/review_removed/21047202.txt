Using genetic and clinical factors to predict tacrolimus dose in renal transplant recipients.
Tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic window and shows significant interindividual difference in dose requirement. In this study we aim to first identify genetic factors that impact tacrolimus dose using a candidate gene association approach, and then generate a personalized algorithm combining identified genetic and clinical factors to predict individualized tacrolimus dose.
