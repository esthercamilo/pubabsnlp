Nanomedicine and personalized medicine toward the application of pharmacotyping in clinical practice to improve drug-delivery outcomes.
Recent technological advances in nanomedicine and nanotechnology in parallel with knowledge accumulated from the clinical translation of disease- and drug-related genomic data have created fertile ground for personalized medicine to emerge as the new direction in diagnosis and drug therapy. To this end, the development of sophisticated nano-based systems for targeted drug delivery, along with the advent of pharmacogenomics, moves the drug-prescription process toward pharmacotyping, e.g., the individualized adjustment of drug selection and dosage. However, the clinical validity and utility of pharmacogenomic testing must be demonstrated by cost-effectiveness analysis and establishment of clinical-practice reimbursement codes. Within this framework, and to achieve major benefits for all patients worldwide, a multidisciplinary scientific and technological infrastructure has to be organized in the healthcare system to address better the issues affecting regulatory environment, clinical pharmacology guidelines, education, bioethics and genomics data dissemination.
