Pharmacogenetic testing revisited: 5' nuclease real-time polymerase chain reaction test panels for genotyping <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i>.
Due to their involvement in the metabolization of commonly prescribed psychopharmaceutical drugs, the cytochrome oxidase genes <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i> are extensive targets for pharmacogenetic testing. The existence of common allelic variants allows the prediction of a metabolic phenotype based on a genotype result, hereby supplying a clinical tool for optimizing prescription and minimizing adverse effects. In this study, we present the development of two 5' nuclease real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test panels, capable of detecting eight of the most clinically relevant alleles of the <i>CYP2D6</i> gene (*2, *3, *4, *6, *9, *10, 17, *41) and the three most common nonfunctional alleles of <i>CYP2C19</i> (*2, *3, *4). The assays have been thoroughly validated using a large collection of reference samples, by parallel testing and by DNA sequencing. The reanalysis of reference samples provided the calculation of the frequency of the <i>CYP2D6</i>*4K allele in a population, not previously reported. Furthermore, original test results from <i>CYP2D6</i>*41, generated based on the presence of the 2850T and the lack of the -1584G single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), were compared with genotyping based on the current acknowledged founder SNP 2988G of this allele. These results indicate that up to 17.7% of the patients originally tested as carriers of the <i>CYP2D6</i>*41 allele may have had an incorrect phenotypic result assigned. The two 5' nuclease real-time PCR test panels have subsequently been optimized for use in the clinical laboratory, using a standard real-time PCR instrument and software.
