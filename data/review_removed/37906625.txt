HDL-C and creatinine levels at 1 month are associated with patient 12-month survival rate after kidney transplantation.
Many factors affect the survival rate after kidney transplantation, including laboratory tests, medicine therapy and pharmacogenomics. Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and methylprednisolone were used as an immunosuppressive regimen after kidney transplantation. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the tacrolimus concentrations and mycophenolate mofetil area under the curve of mycophenolic acid AUC-MPA. Secondary goals were to study the association between perioperative period laboratory tests, medicine therapy, CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms, and survival rate in kidney renal transplant patients.
