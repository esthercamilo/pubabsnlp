NAVAGATE: a rubric to move from pharmacogenomics science to pharmacogenomics practice.
Integration of pharmacogenomic data at the point of care is the next essential step in translating years of research into evidence-based decisions that impact the care of an individual patient. The use of clinical recommendations for pharmacogenomic data help clinicians to better select and monitor drug therapy. However, a systematic rubric for utilizing the data ensures a thorough implementation of the information in a way that may improve the application of the new scientific discoveries. NAVAGATE is a set of eight questions to ask when considering a pharmacogenomic test or test result when caring for a patient. The series of questions are meant to inform prescribing or dispensing when obtaining or employing pharmacogenomic data for these steps within the medical-care framework. In this article two key examples are used to exemplify the benefits of following a systematic process to evaluate the utility of the new scientific data.
