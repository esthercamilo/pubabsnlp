Workforce readiness for pharmacogenomics and key elements for sustainment within the Veterans Health Administration.
<b>Aim:</b> Understanding barriers and facilitators to pharmacogenomics (PGx) implementation and how to structure a clinical program with the Veterans Health Administration (VA). <b>Materials & methods:</b> Healthcare provider (HCP) survey at 20 VA facilities assessing PGx knowledge/acceptance and qualitative interviews to understand how best to design and sustain a national program. <b>Results:</b> 186 (12% response rate) surveyed believed PGx informs drug efficacy (74.7%) and adverse events (71.0%). Low confidence in knowledge (43.0%) and ability to implement (35.4-43.5%). 23 (60.5% response rate) interviewees supported a nationally program to oversee VA education, consultation and IT resources. Prescribing HCPs should be directing local activities. <b>Conclusion:</b> HCPs recognize PGx value but are not prepared to implement. Healthcare systems should build system-wide programs for implementation education and support.
