Investigation of Flavonoid Scaffolds as DAX1 Inhibitors against Ewing Sarcoma through Pharmacoinformatic and Dynamic Simulation Studies.
Dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1 (DAX1) is an orphan nuclear receptor encoded by the <i>NR0B1</i> gene. The functional study showed that DAX1 is a physiologically significant target for EWS/FLI1-mediated oncogenesis, particularly Ewing Sarcoma (ES). In this study, a three-dimensional DAX1 structure was modeled by employing a homology modeling approach. Furthermore, the network analysis of genes involved in Ewing Sarcoma was also carried out to evaluate the association of DAX1 and other genes with ES. Moreover, a molecular docking study was carried out to check the binding profile of screened flavonoid compounds against DAX1. Therefore, 132 flavonoids were docked in the predicted active binding pocket of DAX1. Moreover, the pharmacogenomics analysis was performed for the top ten docked compounds to evaluate the ES-related gene clusters. As a result, the five best flavonoid-docked complexes were selected and further evaluated by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation studies at 100 ns. The MD simulation trajectories were evaluated by generating RMSD, hydrogen bond plot analysis, and interaction energy graphs. Our results demonstrate that flavonoids showed interactive profiles in the active region of DAX1 and can be used as potential therapeutic agents against DAX1-mediated augmentation of ES after in-vitro and in-vivo evaluations.
