Confirmatory DPYD Testing in Patients Receiving Fluoropyrimidines Who are Suspected DPYD Variant Carriers Based on a Genetic Data Repository.
Using pharmacogenetics (PGx) to inform clinical decision making can benefit patients but clinical use of PGx testing has been limited. Existing genetics data obtained in the course of research could be used to identify patients who are suspected, but have not yet been confirmed, to carry clinically actionable genotypes, in whom confirmatory genetic testing could be conducted for highly efficient PGx implementation. Herein, we demonstrate that it is regulatorily and technically feasible to implement PGx by identifying suspected carriers of actionable genotypes within an institutional genetics data repository and conduct confirmatory PGx testing immediately prior to that patient receiving the PGx-relevant drug, using a case study of DPYD testing prior to fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. In 2 years since launching this program, ~ 3,000 suspected DPYD carriers have been passively monitored and one confirmed DPYD carrier was prevented from receiving unacceptably toxic fluoropyrimidine treatment, for minimal cost and effort. Now that we have demonstrated the feasibility of this strategy, we plan to transition to PGx panel testing and expand implementation to other genes and drugs for which the evidence of clinical benefit of PGx-informed treatment is high but PGx testing is not generally conducted. This highly efficient implementation process will maximize the clinical benefits of testing and could be explored at other institutions that have research-only genetic data repositories to expand the number of patients who benefit from PGx-informed treatment while we continue to work toward wide-scale adoption of PGx testing and implementation.
