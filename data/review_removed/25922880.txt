Prevalence of HLA-B*57:01 allele in Argentinean HIV-1 infected patients.
Hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir (ABC hypersensitivity syndrome, AHS) is strongly associated with the presence of the HLA-B*57:01 allele. This study was designed to estimate the prevalence of HLA-B*57:01 allele in Argentinean HIV-1 infected patients. We analyzed the presence of HLA-B*57:01 allele in 1646 HIV-1 infected patients from different regions of Argentina. This allele was detected in 81 patients; most of them corresponded to patients living in the central region of the country. The prevalence of HLA-B*57:01 was 4.9%, similar to other Caucasian populations and higher than other data reported for South American populations. This strongly supports screening for the presence of HLA-B*57:01 in abacavir treatment of HIV-1 in our country.
