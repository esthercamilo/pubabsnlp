secDrug: a pipeline to discover novel drug combinations to kill drug-resistant multiple myeloma cells using a greedy set cover algorithm and single-cell multi-omics.
Multiple myeloma, the second-most common hematopoietic malignancy in the United States, still remains an incurable disease with dose-limiting toxicities and resistance to primary drugs like proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs).We have created a computational pipeline that uses pharmacogenomics data-driven optimization-regularization/greedy algorithm to predict novel drugs ("secDrugs") against drug-resistant myeloma. Next, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) as a screening tool to predict top combination candidates based on the enrichment of target genes. For in vitro validation of secDrugs, we used a panel of human myeloma cell lines representing drug-sensitive, innate/refractory, and acquired/relapsed PI- and IMiD resistance. Next, we performed single-cell proteomics (CyTOF or Cytometry time of flight) in patient-derived bone marrow cells (ex vivo), genome-wide transcriptome analysis (bulk RNA sequencing), and functional assays like CRISPR-based gene editing to explore molecular pathways underlying secDrug efficacy and drug synergy. Finally, we developed a universally applicable R-software package for predicting novel secondary therapies in chemotherapy-resistant cancers that outputs a list of the top drug combination candidates with rank and confidence scores.Thus, using 17AAG (HSP90 inhibitor) + FK866 (NAMPT inhibitor) as proof of principle secDrugs, we established a novel pipeline to introduce several new therapeutic options for the management of PI and IMiD-resistant myeloma.
