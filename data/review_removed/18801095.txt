Methotrexate for psoriasis in the era of biological therapy.
Methotrexate's traditional role as a first line agent for moderate to severe psoriasis is being challenged by the rapid and growing use of biological therapies. A recent study comparing adalimumab with methotrexate showed significantly superior efficacy of adalimumab over methotrexate over 16 weeks. Although it is inexpensive, the future use of methotrexate may be compromised by its unpredictable response and toxicity, and by the introduction of newer, more effective biological therapies. However, recent advances in the screening of liver fibrosis by monitoring serum levels of the aminoterminal peptide fragment of type III procollagen have reduced the need for liver biopsy. Furthermore, the potential for personalized methotrexate use by application of modern pharmacogenetics and pharmacokinetics may ensure its place as a first-line agent for the treatment of psoriasis for the foreseeable future.
