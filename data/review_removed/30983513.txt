Implementing pharmacogenetic testing in rural primary care practices: a pilot feasibility study.
<b>Aim:</b> Assess feasibility and perspectives of pharmacogenetic testing/PGx in rural, primary care physician (PCP) practices when PCPs are trained to interpret/apply results and testing costs are covered. <b>Methods:</b> Participants included PCPs who agreed to training, surveys and interviews and eligible patients who agreed to surveys and testing. 51 patients from three practices participated. <b>Results:</b> Prestudy, no PCP had ever ordered a PGx test. Test results demonstrated gene variations in 30% of patients, related to current medications, with PCPs reporting changes to drug management. Poststudy, test cost was still a concern, but now PCPs reported practical barriers, including the utilization of PGx results over time. PCPs and patients had favorable responses to testing. <b>Summary:</b> PGx testing is feasible in rural PCP practices.
