A Pharmacogenetic Study of <i>CYP2C19</i> in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients of Colombian Origin Reveals New Polymorphisms Potentially Related to Clopidogrel Therapy.
Clopidogrel, an oral platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker, is used in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome. Interindividual variability in treatment response and the occurrence of adverse effects has been attributed to genetic variants in <i>CYP2C19</i>. The analysis of relevant pharmacogenes in ethnically heterogeneous and poorly studied populations contributes to the implementation of personalized medicine. We analyzed the coding and regulatory regions of <i>CYP2C19</i> in 166 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) treated with clopidogrel. The allele frequencies of <i>CYP2C19 alleles</i> *1, *2, *4, *17, *27 and *33 alleles were 86.1%, 7.2%, 0.3%, 10.2%, 0.3% and 0.3%, respectively. A new potentially pathogenic mutation (p.L15H) and five intronic variants with potential splicing effects were detected. In 14.4% of the patients, a new haplotype in strong linkage disequilibrium was identified. The clinical outcome indicated that 13.5% of the patients presented adverse drugs reactions with a predominance of bleeding while 25% of these patients were carriers of at least one polymorphic allele. We propose that new regulatory single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) might potentially influence the response to clopidogrel in Colombian individuals.
