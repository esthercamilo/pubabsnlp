Precision Medicine Strategies to Improve Isoniazid Therapy in Patients with Tuberculosis.
Due to interindividual variability in drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, traditional isoniazid fixed-dose regimens may lead to suboptimal or toxic isoniazid concentrations in the plasma of patients with tuberculosis, contributing to adverse drug reactions, therapeutic failure, or the development of drug resistance. Achieving precision therapy for isoniazid requires a multifaceted approach that could integrate various clinical and genomic factors to tailor the isoniazid dose to individual patient characteristics. This includes leveraging molecular diagnostics to perform the comprehensive profiling of host pharmacogenomics to determine how it affects isoniazid metabolism, such as its metabolism by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), and studying drug-resistant mutations in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome for enabling targeted therapy selection. Several other molecular signatures identified from the host pharmacogenomics as well as other omics-based approaches such as gut microbiome, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic approaches have provided mechanistic explanations for isoniazid pharmacokinetic variability and/or adverse drug reactions and thereby may facilitate precision therapy of isoniazid, though further validations in larger and diverse populations with tuberculosis are required for clinical applications. Therapeutic drug monitoring and population pharmacokinetic approaches allow for the adjustment of isoniazid dosages based on patient-specific pharmacokinetic profiles, optimizing drug exposure while minimizing toxicity and the risk of resistance. Current evidence has shown that with the integration of the host pharmacogenomics-particularly NAT2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomics data along with isoniazid pharmacokinetic concentrations in the blood and patient factors such as anthropometric measurements, comorbidities, and type and timing of food administered-precision therapy approaches in isoniazid therapy can be tailored to the specific characteristics of both the host and the pathogen for improving tuberculosis treatment outcomes.
