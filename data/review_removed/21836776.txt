Gender and the human genome.
GENDER ISSUES ARISE IN RELATION TO THE HUMAN GENOME ACROSS A NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS: the level of attention given to the nuclear genome as opposed to the mitochondrial; the level of basic scientific research; decision-making in the clinic related to both reproductive decision-making on the one hand, and diagnostic and predictive testing on the other; and wider societal implications. Feminist bioethics offers a useful perspective for addressing these issues.
