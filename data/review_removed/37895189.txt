Implementation of Pharmacogenetics in First-Line Care: Evaluation of Its Use by General Practitioners.
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) can explain/predict drug therapy outcomes. There is, however, unclarity about the use and usefulness of PGx in primary care. In this study, we investigated PGx tests ordered by general practitioners (GPs) in 2021 at Dept. Clinical Chemistry, Erasmus MC, and analyzed the gene tests ordered, drugs/drug groups, reasons for testing and single-gene versus panel testing. Additionally, a survey was sent to 90 GPs asking about their experiences and barriers to implementing PGx. In total, 1206 patients and 6300 PGx tests were requested by GPs. <i>CYP2C19</i> was requested most frequently (17%), and clopidogrel was the most commonly indicated drug (23%). Regarding drug groups, antidepressants (51%) were the main driver for requesting PGx, followed by antihypertensives (26%). Side effects (79%) and non-response (27%) were the main indicators. Panel testing was preferred over single-gene testing. The survey revealed knowledge on when and how to use PGx as one of the main barriers. In conclusion, PGx is currently used by GPs in clinical practice in the Netherlands. Side effects are the main reason for testing, which mostly involves antidepressants. Lack of knowledge is indicated as a major barrier, indicating the need for more education on PGx for GPs.
