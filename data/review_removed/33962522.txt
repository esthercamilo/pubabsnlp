Introduction to the mini special issue on next generation drug discovery and development: rethinking translational pharmacology for accelerated drug development.
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic further revealed the barriers to accelerated discovery and development of transformative medicines for life threatening diseases. To effectively and efficiently respond to unmet medical needs, efforts should be directed towards revolutionizing the predictive capability of non-clinical surrogates that inform drug discovery and development programs. I developed this mini special issue amidst the COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate recent advancements and opportunities for four main subthemes that support drug discovery and development including prediction of metabolic pathways, translational pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, pharmacogenomics, and trends in bioanalysis. Scientific papers in these areas were covered by investigators from the International Society for the Study of Xenobiotics New Investigator Group and other investigators. Advancement in the predictive capability of in silico, <i>in vitro</i>, and <i>in vivo</i> models used to determine the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profile of investigational drugs can help offset the cost of unexpected safety and/or efficacy issues during clinical studies. Likewise, extensive application of pharmacogenomics in drug development and clinical care can help direct therapeutic benefits to the appropriate patient population with the overall goal of accelerating drug development and mitigating failed drug cost. Finally, I hope that the scientific contributions in this mini special issue will stimulate practical advancements across all aspects of basic science research that support drug discovery and development to help unlock the door to the next generation of drug discovery and development that features reduced failure rates and accelerated development.
