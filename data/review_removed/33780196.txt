TCF7L2 rs7903146 C>T gene polymorphism is not associated with hypoglycemia in sulfonylurea-treated type 2 diabetic patients.
Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect of sulfonylureas (SUs) and a major concern when using these drugs. Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 C>T polymorphism is an established and well characterized genetic marker of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) risk. The aim of the present study was to analyze the potential association of TCF7L2 rs7903146 C>T polymorphism with SU-induced hypoglycemia in a well characterized cohort of SU-treated patients previously genotyped for cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and P450 oxidoreductase (POR).
