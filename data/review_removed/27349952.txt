Variant Inosine Triphosphatase Phenotypes Are Associated With Increased Ribavirin Triphosphate Levels.
Individuals with lower inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) enzyme activity have a reduced likelihood of experiencing hemolytic anemia during hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment containing ribavirin (RBV). Because ITPA degrades purines and RBV is a purine analogue, it is conceivable that ITPA activity may affect intracellular RBV concentrations. Here we assessed the association between ITPA activity phenotype and concentrations of RBV triphosphate (RBV-TP) in red blood cells (RBCs) during HCV treatment. RBV-TP was quantified in the RBCs of 177 HCV-infected individuals at a median (range) of 84 (19 to 336) days into HCV treatment that included RBV. Mean (SD) RBV-TP concentrations were 92.8 (51.6), 101.3 (53.5), 184.8 (84.5), and 197.7 (64.6) pmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells for 100%, 60%, 30%, and ≤10% ITPA activity groups, respectively. Overall, RBV-TP was approximately 2-fold higher in patients with ≤30% ITPA activity compared to 100% activity (P < .0001). Despite higher RBV-TP levels, individuals with variant ITPA phenotypes had less anemia. The 100% activity group had, on average, a -2.20 g/dL drop in hemoglobin vs -1.43 g/dL (P = .04) for 60% activity, -1.14 g/dL (P = .008) for 30% activity, and -0.70 g/dL (P = .06) for ≤10% activity. This finding of higher RBV-TP concentrations in RBCs in ITPA variants was unexpected given that ITPA activity-deficient individuals have a reduced likelihood of RBV-induced anemia. It also refutes the hypothesis that the mechanism by which ITPA variants are protected against anemia is due to lower RBV-TP levels in RBCs.
