CYP2D6 phenotype-specific codeine population pharmacokinetics.
Codeine's metabolic fate in the body is complex, and detailed quantitative knowledge of it, and that of its metabolites is lacking among prescribers. We aimed to develop a codeine pharmacokinetic pathway model for codeine and its metabolites that incorporates the effects of genetic polymorphisms. We studied the phenotype-specific time courses of plasma codeine, codeine-6-glucoronide, morphine, morphine-3-glucoronide, and morphine-6-glucoronide. A codeine pharmacokinetic pathway model accurately fit the time courses of plasma codeine and its metabolites. We used this model to build a population pharmacokinetic codeine pathway model. The population model indicated that about 10% of a codeine dose was converted to morphine in poor-metabolizer phenotype subjects. The model also showed that about 40% of a codeine dose was converted to morphine in EM subjects, and about 51% was converted to morphine in ultrarapid-metabolizers. The population model further indicated that only about 4% of MO formed from codeine was converted to morphine-6-glucoronide in poor-metabolizer phenotype subjects. The model also showed that about 39% of the MO formed from codeine was converted to morphine-6-glucoronide in extensive-metabolizer phenotypes, and about 58% was converted in ultrarapid-metabolizers. We conclude, a population pharmacokinetic codeine pathway model can be useful because beyond helping to achieve a quantitative understanding the codeine and MO pathways, the model can be used for simulation to answer questions about codeine's pharmacogenetic-based disposition in the body. Our study suggests that pharmacogenetics for personalized dosing might be most effectively advanced by studying the interplay between pharmacogenetics, population pharmacokinetics, and clinical pharmacokinetics.
