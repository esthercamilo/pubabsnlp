Tools in Pharmacogenomics Biomarker Identification for Cancer Patients.
The understanding of the biological differences which underlie the inter-individual variability in drug response improved the efficacy of cancer therapy in the era of precision medicine. In fact molecularly targeted drugs and immunotherapy represent a revolution in cancer treatment. The identification of genetic predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers linked to drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) is allowed by the development of high-throughput omics tools for detecting and understanding biological differences among individuals, in order to improve drug efficacy and minimize risk of toxicity. Personalized medicine in cancer treatment reduces costs of the healthcare system. Unfortunately, pharmacogenomics biomarkers discovery is influenced by complexity, need of high-quality evidence, and a validation process for regulatory purposes. This chapter is focused on the critic analysis of presently available pharmacogenomics tools for discovering or testing genetic polymorphic variants in drug metabolizing enzyme to be introduced in clinical practice for the prospective stratification of cancer patients.
