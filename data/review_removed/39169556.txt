Development of a Multifaceted Program for Pharmacogenetics Adoption at an Academic Medical Center: Practical Considerations and Lessons Learned.
In 2019, Indiana University launched the Precision Health Initiative to enhance the institutional adoption of precision medicine, including pharmacogenetics (PGx) implementation, at university-affiliated practice sites across Indiana. The overarching goal of this PGx implementation program was to facilitate the sustainable adoption of genotype-guided prescribing into routine clinical care. To accomplish this goal, we pursued the following specific objectives: (i) to integrate PGx testing into existing healthcare system processes; (ii) to implement drug-gene pairs with high-level evidence and educate providers and pharmacists on established clinical management recommendations; (iii) to engage key stakeholders, including patients to optimize the return of results for PGx testing; (iv) to reduce health disparities through the targeted inclusion of underrepresented populations; (v) and to track third-party reimbursement. This tutorial details our multifaceted PGx implementation program, including descriptions of our interventions, the critical challenges faced, and the major program successes. By describing our experience, we aim to assist other clinical teams in achieving sustainable PGx implementation in their health systems.
