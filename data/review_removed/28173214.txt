UGT1A1 polymorphism as a prognostic indicator of stage I ovarian clear cell carcinoma patients treated with irinotecan.
We investigated whether UGT1A1 polymorphisms are associated with the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients treated with irinotecan. UGT1A1 genotypes were analyzed in 11 stage I ovarian clear cell carcinoma patients who received irinotecan as first-line therapy. Progression-free survival, overall survival and adverse events were also assessed for each genotype. Three patients harbored UGT1A1*1/*6 while another three harbored UGT1A1*1/*28. Two patients with a wild-type genotype experienced recurrence and one died, whereas no recurrence or death was observed in patients with heterozygous genotypes. Adverse events tended to be more severe in patients with UGT1A1*6 and *28, although progression-free survival and overall survival rates tended to be better than in wild-type; the differences were not significant. We conclude that UGT1A1 polymorphisms have the potential to be a prognostic marker of irinotecan treatment.
