Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Gene Insertion/Deletion Polymorphism Is Not Responsible for Antihypertensive Therapy Induced New Onset of Type 2 Diabetes in Essential Hypertension.
Antihypertensive drug therapies have been reported to be associated with new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus in some hypertensive patients after prolonged use. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been found to affect essential hypertension, response of antihypertensive therapies, and glycemic disturbances. Therefore, ACE gene I/D polymorphism may be associated with risk of new onset of type 2 diabetes via metabolic disturbances, glycemic dysregulation, and insulin resistance.
