Influence of <i>CYP2D6</i> gene polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole in healthy Chinese subjects.
<b>Background:</b> Pharmacogenetics study was added into 2 bioequivalence trials of aripiprazole. The correlation between <i>CYP2D6</i> polymorphisms and aripiprazole pharmacokinetics (PK) was analyzed. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A total of 140 subjects were included. A total of 26 <i>CYP2D6</i> gene alleles were detected. The plasma concentration of aripiprazole was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. <i>SPSS Statistics 21</i> was used to analyze the correlation between <i>CYP2D6</i> polymorphisms and aripiprazole PK parameters. <b>Results:</b> All of the four PK parameters were significantly influenced by <i>CYP2D6</i><i>rs1058164</i> and <i>rs28371699</i>. t<sub>1/2</sub> and area under the concentration-time curve exhibited significant difference between <i>CYP2D6</i> extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers. <b>Conclusion:</b> Aripiprazole PK was greatly influenced by <i>CYP2D6</i>. Attention should be paid to the possible dose adjustment for <i>CYP2D6</i> intermediate metabolizer population when the drug is used in Chinese patients.
