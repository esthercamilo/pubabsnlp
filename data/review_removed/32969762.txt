Liver enzyme <i>CYP2D6</i> gene and tardive dyskinesia.
<b>Background:</b> Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is an iatrogenic involuntary movement disorder occurring after extended antipsychotic use with unclear pathogenesis. <i>CYP2D6</i> is a liver enzyme involved in antipsychotic metabolism and a well-studied gene candidate for TD. <b>Materials & methods:</b> We tested predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype with TD occurrence and severity in our two samples of European chronic schizophrenia patients (total n =Â 198, of which 82 had TD). <b>Results:</b> TD occurrence were associated with extreme metabolizer phenotype, controlling for age and sex (p = 0.012). In other words, individuals with either increased and no CYP2D6 activity were at higher risk of having TD. <b>Conclusion:</b> Unlike most previous findings, TD occurrence may be associated with both extremes of CYP2D6 metabolic activity rather than solely for poor metabolizers.
