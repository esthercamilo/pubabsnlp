Clinical validation of a combinatorial PharmAcogeNomic approach in major Depressive disorder: an Observational prospective RAndomized, participant and rater-blinded, controlled trial (PANDORA trial).
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, chronic, debilitating mood disorder that causes serious functional impairment and significantly decreased quality of life. Pharmacotherapy represents the first-line treatment option; however, only approximately one third of patients respond to the first treatment because of the ineffectiveness or side effects of antidepressants. Precision medicine in psychiatry might offer clinicians the possibility to tailor treatment according to the best possible evidence of efficacy and tolerability for each subject. In this context, our study aims to carry out a clinical validation of a combinatorial pharmacogenomics (PGx) test in an Italian MDD patient cohort with advocacy license independence.
