[Pharmacogenetics in primary health care: implementation and future expectations].
Personalised medicine is a targeted approach to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disorders on the basis of the specific genetic profile of the patient. Pharmacogenetics research shows that differences in the genetic profile of patients explain the interindividual differences in efficacy and side effects of medicines. Although there are high expectations of personalised medicine and pharmacogenetics in healthcare, both are only used to a limited extent to date. Pharmacogenetics seems particularly important in diseases with a poor prognosis and treatments with potentially serious side effects. Pharmacogenetics testing is reimbursed in the case of serious side effects or unexpected ineffectiveness. 95% of patients in the Netherlands have at least one abnormality in the panel of genes for which guidance is available. The KNMP (Royal Dutch Pharmacists' Association) provides dosing advice based on genotype for 80 medicines, 27 of which are regularly prescribed in primary health care.
