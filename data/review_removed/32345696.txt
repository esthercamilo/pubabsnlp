Influence of metabolic profiles on the safety of drug therapy in routine care in Germany: protocol of the cohort study EMPAR.
Pre-emptive testing of pharmacogenetically relevant single-nucleotide polymorphisms can be an effective tool in the prevention of adverse drug reactions and therapy resistance. However, most of the tests are not used as standard in routine care in Germany because of lacking evidence for the clinical and economical benefit and their impact on the usage of healthcare services. We address this issue by investigating the influence of pharmacogenetic profiles on the use of healthcare services over an extended period of several years using routine care data from a statutory health insurance company. The goal is to provide clinical evidence whether pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing of metabolic profiles in routine care in Germany is beneficial and cost-effective.
