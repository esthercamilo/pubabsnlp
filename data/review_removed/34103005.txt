The GEnetic Syntax Score: a genetic risk assessment implementation tool grading the complexity of coronary artery disease-rationale and design of the GESS study.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide and is associated with multiple inherited and environmental risk factors. This study is designed to identify, design, and develop a panel of genetic markers that combined with clinical and angiographic information, will facilitate the creation of a personalized risk prediction algorithm (GEnetic Syntax Score-GESS). GESS score could be a reliable tool for predicting cardiovascular risk for future adverse events and for guiding therapeutic strategies.
