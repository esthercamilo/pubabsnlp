Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Modeling to Predict the Impact of CYP2C9 Genetic Polymorphisms, Co-Medication and Formulation on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Flurbiprofen.
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) models can serve as a powerful framework for predicting the influence as well as the interaction of formulation, genetic polymorphism and co-medication on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drug substances. In this study, flurbiprofen, a potent non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, was chosen as a model drug. Flurbiprofen has absolute bioavailability of ~95% and linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range of 50-300 mg. Its absorption is considered variable and complex, often associated with double peak phenomena, and its pharmacokinetics are characterized by high inter-subject variability, mainly due to its metabolism by the polymorphic CYP2C9 (fmCYP2C9 â‰¥ 0.71). In this study, by leveraging <i>in vitro, in silico</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data, an integrated PBPK/PD model with mechanistic absorption was developed and evaluated against clinical data from PK, PD, drug-drug and gene-drug interaction studies. The PBPK model successfully predicted (within 2-fold) 36 out of 38 observed concentration-time profiles of flurbiprofen as well as the CYP2C9 genetic effects after administration of different intravenous and oral dosage forms over a dose range of 40-300 mg in both Caucasian and Chinese healthy volunteers. All model predictions for C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>inf</sub> and CL/F were within two-fold of their respective mean or geometric mean values, while 90% of the predictions of C<sub>max</sub>, 81% of the predictions of AUC<sub>inf</sub> and 74% of the predictions of Cl/F were within 1.25 fold. In addition, the drug-drug and drug-gene interactions were predicted within 1.5-fold of the observed interaction ratios (AUC, C<sub>max</sub> ratios). The validated PBPK model was further expanded by linking it to an inhibitory <i>E<sub>max</sub></i> model describing the analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen and applying it to explore the effect of formulation and genetic polymorphisms on the onset and duration of pain relief. This comprehensive PBPK/PD analysis, along with a detailed translational biopharmaceutic framework including appropriately designed biorelevant <i>in vitro</i> experiments and <i>in vitro-in vivo</i> extrapolation, provided mechanistic insight on the impact of formulation and genetic variations, two major determinants of the population variability, on the PK/PD of flurbiprofen. Clinically relevant specifications and potential dose adjustments were also proposed. Overall, the present work highlights the value of a translational PBPK/PD approach, tailored to target populations and genotypes, as an approach towards achieving personalized medicine.
