[Study of allelic variants of the CYP2D6 and CYP3A genes on the effectiveness and safety of tamsulosin therapy in patients with BPH: results of a pilot study].
Tamsulosin is a member of the group of selective 1-adrenoblockers. Tamsulosin monotherapy is the most common first-line option in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and can be used regardless on severity of LUTS. The CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of tamsulosin. Carriage of different allelic variants of CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, involved in its metabolism, may potentially affect the variability of efficacy and safety of the drug.
