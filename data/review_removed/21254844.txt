Pharmacogenetic screening of N-acetyltransferase 2, thiopurine s-methyltransferase, and 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms in Northwestern Mexicans.
Specific information about the population pharmacogenetics can be the starting point to study the inheritance of these traits, to design individual drug therapy, and to develop new drugs rationally. Pharmacogenetic studies have been performed in some regions of Mexico, such as Central and Northeast, but this kind of study has not been conducted in the Northwest region so far. Here, we report the distribution of NAT2, TPMT, and MTHFR gene polymorphisms in Baja California, Mexico. We found that our population sample exhibits allele and genotype frequencies that are highly similar to those observed in Caucasian populations, although it should be noted that there are slight similarities with those determined in other populations. As allelic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes are prevalent in our population, it is important to consider pharmacogenetic testing as part of the standard diagnostic protocols before medication.
