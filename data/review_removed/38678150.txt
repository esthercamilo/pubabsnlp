Gene polymorphisms of TACR1 serve as the potential pharmacogenetic predictors of response to the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist-based antiemetic regimens: a candidate-gene association study in breast cancer patients.
The current candidate gene association study aims to investigate tag SNPs from the TACR1 gene as pharmacogenetic predictors of response to the antiemetic guidelines-recommended, NK-1 receptor antagonist-based, triple antiemetic regimens.
