The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group experience.
The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) study group, an academic research organization, was formed in 1984 with initial support from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Its initial goal was to compare the effects of the then-new thrombolytic agent, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, with streptokinase. The TIMI study group has remained active since then and has completed 50 multicenter clinical trials. The TIMI network now collaborates with more than 1000 separate sites in 45 countries on 5 continents. In addition to thrombolytic agents, TIMI has studied antithrombotic, antiplatelet, anti-ischemic, lipid lowering, and anti-inflammatory drugs. TIMI has also established robust biomarker and pharmacogenetics programs, and has devised a panel of risk assessment scores that are widely used. TIMI is currently conducting 7 large trials worldwide on novel agents designed to reduce the morbidity and mortality of a variety of cardiovascular disorders.
