The CYP1A2 -163C>A polymorphism is associated with clozapine-induced generalized tonic-clonic seizures in Brazilian schizophrenia patients.
We evaluated two polymorphisms at CYP1A2 (*1C and *1F) in a sample of 108 European-derived patients with schizophrenia and their influence on the pro-convulsive effect of clozapine. We found the *1F/*1F genotype to be significantly associated with seizures, and no relationship was observed with combinations of *1F and *1C alleles.
