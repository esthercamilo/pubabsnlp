From Homer and Hippocrates to modern personalized medicine: is there a role for pharmacoepigenomics in the treatment of alcohol addiction?
From the earliest times to the present, alcohol has evolved as part of life and culture. For most adults, moderate alcohol use is harmless, however, it lies at one end of a range that moves through alcohol abuse to alcohol addiction. Alcohol addiction is a serious and chronic psychiatric disorder that, on top of its heavy consequences on health, also brings significant social and economic losses to individuals and society at large. Pharmacotherapy of alcohol addiction exists, but its effectiveness varies significantly among individuals. Genomic and nongenomic factors are significant contributors to interindividual variation in the clinical presentation of alcohol problems and the response to a given treatment. In addition, emerging evidence suggests pharmacoepigenomics of alcohol addiction as a novel promising area for improvement of alcohol addiction management.
