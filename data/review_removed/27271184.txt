CYP2C8 and SLCO1B1 Variants and Therapeutic Response to Thiazolidinediones in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are putatively transported into the liver by OATP1B1 (encoded by SLCO1B1) and metabolized by CYP450 2C8 enzyme (encoded by CYP2C8). While CYP2C8*3 has been shown to alter TZD pharmacokinetics, it has not been shown to alter efficacy.
