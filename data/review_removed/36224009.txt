<i>HLA-DQA1</i> and <i>DQB1</i> Alleles are Associated with Acitretin Response in Patients with Psoriasis.
Psoriasis vulgaris is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease. Although the pathogenesis of psoriasis is unclear, genetic susceptibility, such as <i>HLA-C*06:02</i>, is believed to be a major risk factor. However, there is a paucity of knowledge regarding the relationship between genetics and the response to systemic treatment of psoriasis. We hypothesized that genetic variations in human leukocyte antigen (<i>HLA</i>) genes may act as predictors of acitretin treatment in psoriasis. The aim of our study was to explore the presence of <i>HLA</i> gene variants in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis receiving acitretin treatment.
