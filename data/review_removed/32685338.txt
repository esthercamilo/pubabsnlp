Using pharmacogenomics and therapeutic drug monitoring to guide drug selection and dosing in outpatient mental health comprehensive medication management.
Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing aided by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has the potential to improve medication-related outcomes in some individuals prescribed psychiatric medications. Many commonly prescribed psychiatric medications are metabolized through polymorphic drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome p450 (CYP) 2D6 (CYP2D6) and CYP2C19. Through PGx testing, clinicians can make biologically informed choices when selecting a new medication, and TDM may help inform dose adjustments or assess exposures to current treatments. Herein, we describe 2 complex case reports of individuals with multiple psychiatric diagnoses and extensive histories of medication failures who underwent PGx testing in addition to TDM as part of a pharmacist-led comprehensive medication therapy management evaluation in a community mental health clinic setting.
