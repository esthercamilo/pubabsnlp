Genetics and personalized medicine--a role in statin therapy?
Pharmacogenetics uses the genetic variation in metabolic pathways to identify groups of patients who may respond differently in terms of therapeutic and adverse effects. Much clinical interest lies in drug metabolism and the opportunity to improve prescribing efficacy and safety. Owing to widespread use and increasing concern regarding side effects, statins are of significant interest in this area. Among other benefits, statins have been shown to improve lipid profiles and reduce coronary heart disease event rates in many populations. However, variability in drug response exists, and genetic variability may be a contributing factor. Our primary goal is to feature the most important genes involved in lipid metabolism, clinical outcomes, and statin-induced side effects, highlighting genome-wide association studies and the candidate gene approach.
