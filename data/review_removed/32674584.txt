Immunological therapeutics in acute aortic syndrome.
Acute aortic syndrome is a group of interlinked conditions with common presenting symptoms, including aortic dissection, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, and intramural hematoma. Pharmacological management of acute aortic syndrome is a growing area, with key themes to address the underlying inflammatory pathways believed to be the cause. Research into interleukins, matrix metalloproteinases, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor are just some of the many immunological properties being investigated and translated into medical therapies. Stem cell experiments may indicate further advances in the pathologies of acute aortic syndrome. The study of pharmacogenomics to improve treatment across different genomes is also a novel area outlined in this paper.
