Pharmacogenomic Score Effectively Personalizes Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
Cytarabine (also known as ara-C) has been the backbone of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) chemotherapy for over five decades. Recent pharmacogenomics-based 10-SNP ara-C score (ACS10) showed low ACS10 (Â£0) to be associated with poor outcome in AML patients treated with standard chemotherapy. Here, we evaluated ACS10 score in the context of three different induction 1 regimens in pediatric AML patients.
