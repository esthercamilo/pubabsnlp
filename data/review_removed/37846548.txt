Pharmacogenomics of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine: current evidence and future implications.
As substrates of CYP2C8, CYP3A4/5 and CYP2D6, chloroquine's (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine's (HCQ) efficacy and safety may be affected by variants in the genes encoding these enzymes. This paper aims to assimilate the current evidence on the pharmacogenomics of CQ/HCQ and to identify risk phenotypes affecting the safety or efficacy of these drugs. It has been found that some <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP2C8</i> genetic variants may affect the safety or effectiveness of CQ/HCQ. The phenotypes predictively representing ultra-rapid and poor metabolizers have been considered high-risk phenotypes. After considering these high-risk phenotypes in different ethnic groups, it is predicted that a considerable proportion of patients taking CQ/HCQ may be at risk of either therapeutic failure or severe toxicities.
