Development of multiplex pyrosequencing for HLA-B*57:01 screening using single nucleotide polymorphism haplotype.
Abacavir (ABC) is a commonly used nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor with potent antiviral activity against HIV-1. The US Food and Drug Administration and international HIV treatment guidelines recommend HLA-B*57:01 screening before initiating treatment with ABC. The current standard method for HLA-B*57:01 screening is limited by its high-cost, time-consuming and labour-intensive procedure with the requirement of a specialized laboratory. Our study aims to develop a more reliable screening test by selecting rs3093726 as an additional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to combine with rs2395029 for multiplex pyrosequencing development. It offers high-accuracy, cost-effective and rapid detection.
