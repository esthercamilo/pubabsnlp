Association of CD58 Polymorphism with Multiple Sclerosis and Response to Interferon ß Therapy in A Subset of Iranian Population.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the leading neurodegenerative causes of physical disability world-wide. Genetic aberrations of autoimmunity pathway components have been demonstrated to significantly influence MS development. Cluster of Differentiation 58 (CD58) is pertained to a group of genes which had been assayed in several recent association studies. Given the significance of CD58 in modulation of T regulatory cells that control autoimmune responses, the present study was conducted to investigate the frequency of rs12044852 polymorphism and its effect on the outcome of interferon beta (IFN-β) therapy in a subset of Iranian MS patients.
