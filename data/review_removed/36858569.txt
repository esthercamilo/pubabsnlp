Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms, c.415C > T (Arg139Cys) and c.416G > A (Arg139His), in the NUDT15 Gene Are Associated with Thiopurine-Induced Leukopenia.
While nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 15 (NUDT15) gene polymorphism Arg139Cys (rs116855232) is known to be a risk factor for thiopurine-induced severe leukopenia, association with the NUDT15 gene polymorphism Arg139His (rs147390019) has not yet been clarified. In addition, the accuracy of TaqMan PCR to assess these two polymorphisms has not been investigated. In this study, we evaluated TaqMan PCR for detection of the NUDT15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and examined the clinical impact of Arg139His on thiopurine-induced leukopenia. First, we demonstrated that a TaqMan PCR assay successfully detected the Arg139His polymorphism of NUDT15 in clinical samples. Next, the NUDT15 gene polymorphisms (Arg139Cys and Arg139His) were separately analyzed by TaqMan Real-Time PCR in 189 patients from August 2018 to July 2019. The incidences of leukopenia within 2 years were 16.2, 57.9, and 100% for arginine (Arg)/Arg, Arg/cysteine (Cys), and Arg/histidine (His), respectively. The leukopenia was significantly increased in Arg/Cys and Arg/His compared with Arg/Arg. This retrospective clinical study indicated that, in addition to Arg139Cys, Arg139His may be clinically associated with a high risk of leukopenia. Pharmacogenomics will help in selecting drugs and determining the individualized dosage of thiopurine drugs.
