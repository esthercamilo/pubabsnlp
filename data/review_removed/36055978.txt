A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pharmacogenetic study of ondansetron for treating alcohol use disorder.
In a previous study, ondansetron, a serotonin 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, reduced drinking intensity (drinks/drinking day [DPDD]) among European-ancestry (EA) participants with moderate-to-severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) and variants in genes encoding the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and 5-HT<sub>3A</sub> (HTR3A), and 5-HT<sub>3B</sub> (HTR3B) receptors. We tested whether (1) ondansetron reduces DPDD among individuals of either European or African ancestry (AA), and (2) that reductions in DPDD are greatest among ondansetron-treated individuals with population-specific combinations of genotypes at SLC6A4, HTR3A, and HTR3B.
