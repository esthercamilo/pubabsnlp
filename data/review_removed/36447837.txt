Utilization of Drugs with Pharmacogenetic Dosing Recommendations in Switzerland: A Descriptive Study Using the Helsana Database.
In Switzerland 167 drugs on the market contain information about pharmacogenetics in their drug label (PGx drug). Preemptive pharmacogenetic testing is reimbursed by health care insurance for only seven drugs (abacavir, carbamazepine, 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, 5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, and irinotecan) although, it is proposed to be a cost-effective approach to personalized medicine. The aim of this study was to describe the use of PGx drugs and their corresponding genes in Switzerland.
