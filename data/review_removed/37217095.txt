Substantiation of a clopidogrel metabolism-associated gene (CYP2C19) variation among healthy individuals.
It is essential to investigate the prevalence of CYP2C19 alleles that affect drug metabolism. This study measures the allelic and genotypic frequencies of CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LoF) alleles CYP2C19∗2, CYP2C19∗3, and gain-of-function (GoF) alleles CYP2C19∗17 in the general population.
