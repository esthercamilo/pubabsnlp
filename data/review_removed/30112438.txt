A Gene Expression Signature Predicts Bladder Cancer Cell Line Sensitivity to EGFR Inhibition.
Bladder cancer remains a cancer type in need of novel and alternative therapies. While multiple inhibitors of EGFR have been evaluated for efficacy in bladder cancer, the results have largely been disappointing with few patients responding to these therapies. Yet, there is a subset of patients that positively responds to EGFR inhibition with tumor shrinkage, indicating it is an effective treatment for a targeted set of bladder tumors.
