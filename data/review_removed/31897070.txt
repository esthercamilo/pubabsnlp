Status Epilepticus: The Slow and Agonizing Death of Phenytoin.
Since its introduction in 1950, phenytoin (PHT) has been the premier parenteral anticonvulsant used in the management of generalized convulsive status epileptics (GCSE) that is refractory to benzodiazepines. Without question, its arrival was vital to the care of patients with acute seizures and was a welcomed alternative to paraldehyde and phenobarbital. However, after more than half a century of use, there continues to be insufficient evidence-based data to support its efficacy over other anticonvulsants as a first-line agent in pediatric or adult patients with GCSE. This coupled with its narrow mechanism of action, complex pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics, drug-drug interactions, unique adverse effects, and formulation issues that make administration difficult mandates that PHT be replaced by safer and superiorly effective anticonvulsants for the treatment of GCSE when benzodiazepines are ineffective. We believe that levetiracetam should become the preferred agent for seizures unresponsive to or recurring after treatment with a benzodiazepine as it is at least equally effective to PHT and has several important advantages. PHT has overstayed its welcome and it is simply time for it to exit the realm of acute seizure management as a first-line agent for benzodiazepine-refractory GCSE.
