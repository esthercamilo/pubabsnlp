Pediatric transplantation: opportunities for pharmacogenomics and genomics.
Heterogeneity is the rule among pediatric heart transplant recipients. Patients vary in age, size, organ maturity, immune system maturity and underlying disease etiology, which can all influence post-transplant outcomes. Overall, the survival of pediatric transplant recipients continues to improve and the goal remains long-term survival of the primary graft and mitigation of long-term complications and adverse events. The evolving fields of pharmacogenomics and genomics have the potential to revolutionize and personalize the care of pediatric transplant recipients, and although clinical validation in a pediatric cohort is lacking, many of these technologies are becoming more readily available. We discuss genotype-guided dosing of immunosuppressant medications and other commonly used medications after transplantation, the influence of donor and recipient genotype on risk of post-transplant complications, genotype-guided selection of therapies to treat complications, and the use of next-generation sequencing for noninvasive detection of graft rejection.
