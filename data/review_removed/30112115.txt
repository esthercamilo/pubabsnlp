Association between genetic polymorphisms and platinum-induced ototoxicity in children.
Platinum is extensively used in the treatment of several childhood cancers. However, ototoxicity is one of the most notable adverse effects, especially in children. Several studies suggest that genetics may predict its occurrence. Here, polymorphisms associated with platinum-induced ototoxicity were selected from the literature and were investigated in a pediatric population treated with platinum-based agents. In this retrospective study, patients treated with cisplatin and/or carboplatin were screened. The patients with pre- and post-treatment audiogram (Brock criteria) available were included. We selected polymorphisms that have previously been associated with cisplatin ototoxicity with a minor allele frequency ≥30%. Deletion of <i>GSTM1</i> and <i>GSTT1</i>, rs1799735 (<i>GSTM3</i>), rs1695 (<i>GSTP1</i>), rs4880 (<i>SOD2</i>), rs2228001 (<i>XPC</i>), rs1799793 (<i>XPD</i>) and rs4788863 (<i>SLC16A5</i>) were investigated. Data of one hundred and six children matching the eligible criteria were analyzed. Thirty-three patients (31%) developed ototoxicity (with a Brock grade ≥2). The probability of hearing loss increased significantly in patients carrying the null genotype for <i>GSTT1</i> (P = 0.03), A/A genotype at rs1695 (P = 0.01), and C/C genotype at rs1799793 (P = 0.008). We also showed an association of the cumulative doses of carboplatin with cisplatin ototoxicity (P <0.05). To conclude, deletion of <i>GSTT1</i>, rs1695 and rs1799793 may constitute potential predictors of platinum-induced ototoxicity.
