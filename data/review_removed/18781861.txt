Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and antidepressant action: another piece of evidence from pharmacogenetics.
EVALUATION OF: Gratac√≤s M, Soria V, Urretavizcaya M et al.: A brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) haplotype is associated with antidepressant treatment outcome in mood disorders. Pharmacogenomics J. 8, 101-112 (2008). The neurotrophin hypothesis of depression and antidepressant drug action postulates that reduced activity of neurotrophic factors, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), plays an important role in the pathogenesis of major depression, and that its restoration may represent a critical mechanism underlying antidepressant therapeutic effect. This hypothesis is supported by numerous animal studies; however, evidence from clinical studies is lacking. This study is the first to use both single-marker as well as haplotype analysis to test the effect of genetic variants of BDNF on the therapeutic effects of antidepressant treatment in mood disorder. Among eight BDNF TagSNPs tested, one allele (rs908867) is associated with antidepressant response, with heterozygote carriers showing a better response than homozygous analog. The authors also identified a haplotype associated with the therapeutic response. This study provides clinical evidence to support the role of BDNF in antidepressant therapeutic mechanisms. However, further work is needed to confirm the findings, for several reasons. First, the study included not only major depression but also bipolar disorder patients; second, various antidepressants were used in this study, which could affect patients' responses; third, the frequency of the haplotype associated with treatment response is rare; and fourth, previous studies of the effects of single BDNF polymorphisms on antidepressant action have reported conflicting findings. Several suggestions for further work are discussed below.
