Impact of GATA4 variants on stable warfarin doses in patients with prosthetic heart valves.
Interindividual variability in stable warfarin doses is largely attributed to VKORC1 and CYP2C9 variants. On the basis of a recent finding of the role of GATA4 in control of CYP2C9 expression, we tested a possible effect of GATA4 genotypes on variability in warfarin response using 201 Korean patients with prosthetic cardiac valves. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2645400 (G>T) and rs4841588 (G>T), were significantly associated with stable warfarin doses in patients carrying CYP2C9 wild-type homozygotes; homozygote carriers of these two SNPs required higher doses than those with other genotypes (5.94±1.73 versus 5.34±1.88 mg, P=0.026; 5.94±1.66 versus 5.37±1.92, P=0.036, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that two GATA4 combinations, rs867858 (G>T)/rs10090884 (A>C) and rs2645400 (G>T)/rs4841588 (G>T), increased contribution to the overall warfarin dose variability from 36.4 to 40.9%. This study revealed that GATA4 can be predictive of stable warfarin dose and extended warfarin pharmacogenetics further to the regulation of CYP2C9 expression.
