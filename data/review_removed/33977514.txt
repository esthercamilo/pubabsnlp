[Genomic Medicine Sweden - a national initiative for the broad introduction of precision medicine in Swedish healthcare].
The Genomic Medicine Sweden (GMS) initiative aims to strengthen precision medicine across the country. This will be accomplished through the implementation of large-scale sequencing techniques in Swedish healthcare. With a patient-centered view, initial efforts will focus on rare diseases, cancer, pharmacogenomics, and infectious diseases, and subsequently extend to complex diseases. GMS is being implemented as a broad collaborative project involving healthcare, universities with medical faculty, SciLifeLab, industry and patient organizations. To deliver top tier diagnostics, regional genomic medicine centers (GMC) are currently under establishment together with a national informatics infrastructure for data sharing. GMS will also offer a unique resource for research that could pave the way for the development of novel drugs, and enhance collaboration with industry. In summary, GMS provides Sweden with an opportunity to take an international forefront position in the field of precision medicine.
