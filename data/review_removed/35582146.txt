Germline variants in cancer therapy.
Cancer pharmacogenetics implies a complex combination of germline variants from the patient and somatic mutations in tumor cells. Somatic mutations meanwhile have become drugable targets or biomarkers, whereas germline mutations potentially predict adverse drug effects or drug response. Here, we evaluate hereditary variants in biotransforming enzymes and drug transporters, such as thiopurine S-methyltransferase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (<i>UGT1A1</i>), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (<i>DPD</i>), as well as ABC transporters (<i>ABCB1</i>, <i>ABCG2</i> and <i>ABCC</i> subfamily) with respect to cytostatics and targeted therapies. Furthermore, gene expression regulation with regards to epigenetics and posttranscriptional modification are discussed.
