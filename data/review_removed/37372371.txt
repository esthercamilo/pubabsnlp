The Distribution of the Genotypes of <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>CES1</i> Polymorphisms in Kazakhstani Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Treated with DOAC.
Nowadays, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the first-line anticoagulant strategy in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). We aimed to identify the influence of polymorphisms of the genes encoding P-glycoprotein (<i>ABCB1</i>) and carboxylesterase 1 (<i>CES1</i>) on the variability of plasma concentrations of DOACs in Kazakhstani patients with NVAF. We analyzed polymorphisms rs4148738, rs1045642, rs2032582 and rs1128503 in <i>ABCB1</i> and rs8192935, rs2244613 and rs71647871 <i>CES1</i> genes and measured the plasma concentrations of dabigatran/apixaban and biochemical parameters in 150 Kazakhstani NVAF patients. Polymorphism rs8192935 in the <i>CES1</i> gene (<i>p</i> = 0.04), BMI (<i>p</i> = 0.01) and APTT level (<i>p</i> = 0.01) were statistically significant independent factors of trough plasma concentration of dabigatran. In contrast, polymorphisms rs4148738, rs1045642, rs2032582 and rs1128503 in <i>ABCB1</i> and rs8192935, rs2244613 and rs71647871 <i>CES1</i> genes did not show significant influence on plasma concentrations of dabigatran/apixaban drugs (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Patients with GG genotype (138.8 ± 100.1 ng/mL) had higher peak plasma concentration of dabigatran than with AA genotype (100.9 ± 59.6 ng/mL) and AG genotype (98.7 ± 72.3 ng/mL) (Kruskal-Wallis test, <i>p</i> = 0.25). Thus, <i>CES1</i> rs8192935 is significantly associated with plasma concentrations of dabigatran in Kazakhstani NVAF patients (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The level of the plasma concentration shows that biotransformation of the dabigatran processed faster in individual carriers of GG genotype rs8192935 in the <i>CES1</i> gene than with AA genotype.
