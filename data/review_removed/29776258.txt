Clinical decision support for personalized medicine: an opportunity for pharmacist-physician collaboration.
Pharmacogenomics has significant potential to improve the efficacy and safety of medication therapy, but it requires new expertise and adds a new layer of complexity for all healthcare professionals. Pharmacists and pharmacy management systems can play a leading role in providing clinical decision support for the use and interpretation of pharmacogenomic tests. To serve this role effectively, pharmacists will need to expand their expertise in the emerging field of clinical pharmacogenomics. Pharmacy-based clinical programs can expedite the use of pharmacogenomic testing, help physicians interpret the test results and identify future medication risks associated with the patient's phenotype. Over time, some of these functions can be embedded in clinical decision support systems as part of the broader automation of the healthcare system.
