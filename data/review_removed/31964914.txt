CRL4-Cereblon complex in Thalidomide Embryopathy: a translational investigation.
The Cereblon-CRL4 complex has been studied predominantly with regards to thalidomide treatment of multiple myeloma. Nevertheless, the role of Cereblon-CRL4 in Thalidomide Embryopathy (TE) is still not understood. Not all embryos exposed to thalidomide develop TE, hence here we evaluate the role of the CRL4-Cereblon complex in TE variability and susceptibility. We sequenced CRBN, DDB1, CUL4A, IKZF1, and IKZF3 in individuals with TE. To better interpret the variants, we suggested a score and a heatmap comprising their regulatory effect. Differential gene expression after thalidomide exposure and conservation of the CRL4-Cereblon protein complex were accessed from public repositories. Results suggest a summation effect of Cereblon variants on pre-axial longitudinal limb anomalies, and heatmap scores identify the CUL4A variant rs138961957 as potentially having an effect on TE susceptibility. CRL4-Cereblon gene expression after thalidomide exposure and CLR4-Cereblon protein conservation does not explain the difference in Thalidomide sensitivity between species. In conclusion, we suggest that CRL4-Cereblon variants act through several regulatory mechanisms, which may influence CRL4-Cereblon complex assembly and its ability to bind thalidomide. Human genetic variability must be addressed not only to further understand the susceptibility to TE, but as a crucial element in therapeutics, including in the development of pharmacogenomics strategies.
