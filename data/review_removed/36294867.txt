Is the CYP2D6 Genotype Associated with Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain?
Antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) is a serious adverse effect. Studies have linked genetically-predicted CYP2D6 metabolic capacity to AIWG. The evidence, however, is ambiguous. We performed multiple regression analyses examining the association between genetic-predicted CYP2D6 metabolic capacity and AIWG. Analyses were based on previously unpublished data from an RCT investigating the clinical utility of routine genotyping of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in patients with schizophrenia. A total of 211 patients, corresponding to 71% of the original study population, were included. Our analyses indicated an effect of genetically predicted CYP2D6 metabolic capacity on AIWG with significant weight gain in both CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs) (4.00 kg (95% CI: 0.80; 7.21)) and ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) (6.50 kg (95% CI: 1.03; 12.0)). This finding remained stable after adjustment for covariates (PMs: 4.26 kg (0.88; 7.64), UMs: 7.26 kg (1.24; 13.3)). In addition to the CYP2D6 metabolic capacity, both baseline body mass index (-0.24 (95% CI: -0.44; -0.03)) and chlorpromazine equivalents per day (0.0041 (95% CI: 0.0005; 0.0077)) were statistically significantly associated with weight change in the adjusted analysis. Our results support that the genetically predicted CYP2D6 metabolic capacity matters for AIWG.
