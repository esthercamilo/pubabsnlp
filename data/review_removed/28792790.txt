Recent developments and future directions for the use of pharmacogenomics in cardiovascular disease treatments.
Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death worldwide. There are many environmental and genetic factors that play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. The treatment of cardiovascular disease is beginning to move in the direction of personalized medicine by using biomarkers from the patient's genome to design more effective treatment plans. Pharmacogenomics have already uncovered many links between genetic variation and response of many different drugs. Areas covered: This article will focus on the main polymorphisms that impact the risk of adverse effects and response efficacy of statins, clopidogrel, aspirin, Î²-blockers, warfarin dalcetrapib and vitamin E. The genes discussed include SLCO1B1, ABCB1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C19, PTGS1, PTGS2, ADRB1, ADCY9, CYP2C19, PON1, CES1, PEAR1, GPIIIa, CYP2D6, CKORC1, CYP2C9 and Hp. Expert opinion: Although there are some convincing results that have already been incorporated in the labelling treatment guidelines, most gene-drug relationships have been inconsistent. A better understanding of the relationships between genetic factors and drug response will provide more opportunities for personalized diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease.
