Genetic Predisposition to Drug-Induced Liver Injury.
Identification of genetic predisposition to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is of paramount importance. Early candidate gene studies have identified various polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing genes that infer increased DILI susceptibility. Few of these have been confirmed in more recent genome-wide association studies, which have identified several specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. The low incidence rate of DILI, however, leads to a low positive predictive value for currently identified genetic variations, making them unsuitable for pre-prescription screening. HLA screening incorporated into clinical practice can aid the diagnostic process resulting in enhanced diagnostic accuracy and confidence.
