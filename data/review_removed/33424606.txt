Ancestry and TPMT-VNTR Polymorphism: Relationship with Hematological Toxicity in Uruguayan Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) is a thiopurine drug widely used in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy. Genes such as <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i> have an outstanding role in 6-MP metabolism. Mutations in both genes explain a significant portion of hematological toxicities suffered by ALL Uruguayan pediatric patients. A variable number tandem repeat in the <i>TPMT</i> promoter (<i>TPMT-</i>VNTR) has been associated with <i>TPMT</i> expression. This VNTR has a conservative architecture (AnBmC). To explore new causes of hematological toxicities related to ALL therapy, we genotyped the <i>TPMT-</i>VNTR of 130 Uruguayan pediatric patients. Additionally, individual genetic ancestry was estimated by 45 ancestry-informative markers (AIMs). Hematological toxicity was measured as the number of leukopenia events and 6-MP dose along the maintenance phase. As previously reported, we found <i>TPMT*2</i> and <i>TPMT*3C</i> alleles were associated to <i>TPMT-</i>VNTR A2BC and AB2C, respectively. However, contrasting with other reports, <i>TPMT*3A</i> allele was found in a heterogeneous genetic background in linkage equilibrium. Patients carrying more than 5 A repeats present a significant higher number of leukopenia events among patients without <i>TPMT</i> and/or <i>NUDT15</i> variants. Native American ancestry and the number of A repeats were significantly correlated with the number of leukopenia events. However, the correlation between Native American ancestry and the number of leukopenia events was lost when the number of A repeats was considered as covariate. This suggests that <i>TPMT-</i>VNTR alleles are more relevant than Native American ancestry in the hematological toxicity. Our results emphasize that <i>TPMT</i>-VNTR may be used as a pharmacogenetic biomarker to predict 6-MP-related hematological toxicity in ALL childhood therapy.
