Race and smoking status associated with paclitaxel drug response in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines.
The use of ex-vivo model systems to provide a level of forecasting for in-vivo characteristics remains an important need for cancer therapeutics. The use of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) is an attractive approach for pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics, due to their scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. There is little data on the impact of demographic or clinical covariates on LCL response to chemotherapy. Paclitaxel sensitivity was determined in LCLs from 93 breast cancer patients from the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Breast Cancer Database to test for potential associations and/or confounders in paclitaxel dose-response assays. Measures of paclitaxel cell viability were associated with patient data included treatment regimens, cancer status, demographic and environmental variables, and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate analysis of variance to identify the in-vivo variables associated with ex-vivo dose-response. In this unique dataset that includes both in-vivo and ex-vivo data from breast cancer patients, race (P = 0.0049) and smoking status (P = 0.0050) were found to be significantly associated with ex-vivo dose-response in LCLs. Racial differences in clinical dose-response have been previously described, but the smoking association has not been reported. Our results indicate that in-vivo smoking status can influence ex-vivo dose-response in LCLs, and more precise measures of covariates may allow for more precise forecasting of clinical effect. In addition, understanding the mechanism by which exposure to smoking in-vivo effects ex-vivo dose-response in LCLs may open up new avenues in the quest for better therapeutic prediction.
