Understanding Personalized Medicine in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Clinician's Guide to the Future.
Personalized medicine refers to the utilization of technologies at the molecular level to understand disease processes and improve health outcomes. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) some factors associated with disease outcome have been identified. These factors have not yet been integrated into a clinically useful tool to predict disease outcome in individual patients. Developments in pharmacogenomics are moving the field forward quite rapidly. Genetic variants, which may have a role in drug metabolism mediating either drug response or toxicity, have been identified for both traditional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents. Choosing a medication based on a patient's characteristics (sociodemographic, clinical, genetic) will result in better utilization of resources and better clinical outcomes. The ethical, political, and legal implications of personalized medicine need to be considered as well.
