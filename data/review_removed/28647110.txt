Success of tardive electroconvulsive therapy sessions after loxapine-induced malignant syndrome in the context of very poor metabolisation.
We report the success of tardive electroconvulsive therapy in a case of loxapine malignant syndrome with catatonia. Loxapine and its metabolites were measured in biological samples by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Genes were studied by sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Plasmatic drug concentrations showed a supratherapeutic concentration of loxapine with a very low 8-hydroxyloxapine/loxapine ratio (range from 0.32 to 0.66, normal value>2 for 100mg) and a very long elimination half-life of loxapine (half-life>140h, normal value from 1 to 4hours). We tried to explain this kinetics by exploring the main pharmacogenes implicated in the metabolism of loxapine. No genetic abnormality for CYP1A2 was observed. The study of associated treatments showed the potential contribution of valproate. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics investigations revealed a blockade of the CYP1A2 metabolic pathway without genetic abnormalities, probably due to valproate co-medication. Toxicological monitoring of loxapine and its metabolites helped to explain the persistence of symptoms and to adapt the therapeutic management.
