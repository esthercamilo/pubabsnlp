[The usefulness of pharmacogenetics for a more individualized treatment. The example thiopurines in inflammatory bowel disease and childhood leukemia].
Thiopurines are chemotherapeutic drugs used for treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases and childhood leukemia. Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is a polymorphic enzyme involved in the metabolism of thiopurines. Individuals lacking TPMT are at increased risk for severe side effects when treated with conventional doses of thiopurines. A research group at the division of drug research at Link√∂ping University is studying thiopurine pharmacogenetics. Since the year 2000, the lab has determined the TPMT status in over 12000 individuals, as an aid to decide thiopurine doses before starting treatment. New knowledge of how genetic factors influence thiopurine treatment effect are anticipated to improve the possibilities for individualization of thiopurine therapy.
