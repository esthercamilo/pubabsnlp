Genetic Aspects of Inflammation and Immune Response in Stroke.
Genetic determinants play important role in the complex processes of inflammation and immune response in stroke and could be studied in different ways. Inflammation and immunomodulation are associated with repair processes in ischemic stroke, and together with the concept of preconditioning are promising modes of stroke treatment. One of the important aspects to be considered in the recovery of patients after the stroke is a genetic predisposition, which has been studied extensively. Polymorphisms in a number of <i>candidate genes</i>, such as <i>IL-6</i>, <i>BDNF</i>, <i>COX2</i>, <i>CYPC19</i>, and <i>GPIIIa</i> could be associated with stroke outcome and recovery. Recent GWAS studies pointed to the variant in <i>genes</i><i>PATJ</i> and <i>LOC</i> as new genetic markers of long term outcome. Epigenetic regulation of immune response in stroke is also important, with mechanisms of histone modifications, DNA methylation, and activity of non-coding RNAs. These complex processes are changing from acute phase over the repair to establishing homeostasis or to provoke exaggerated reaction and death. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics of stroke cures might also be evaluated in the context of immuno-inflammation and brain plasticity. Potential novel genetic treatment modalities are challenged but still in the early phase of the investigation.
