Exploring pharmacogenetic variants for predicting response to anti-TNF therapy in autoimmune diseases: a meta-analysis.
<b>Aim:</b> The aim of this study is to explore how SNPs may affect the response to anti-TNF-α therapy in the major autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and Spondyloarthritis. <b>Methodology:</b> We conducted a systematic overview on the field, by assessing all studies that examined the association between polymorphisms and response to anti-TNF-α therapy in participants of European descent. <b>Results:</b> In total, six independent SNPs located in <i>FCGR2A</i>, <i>FCGR3A</i>, <i>TNF-α</i> and <i>TNFRSF1B</i> genes were significantly associated with response to TNF-α blockers, found mainly in disease-subgroup analyses. <b>Conclusion:</b> No common pharmacogenetic variant was identified for all autoimmune diseases under study, suggesting the requirement of more studies in the field in order to capture such predictive variants that will aid treatment selection.
