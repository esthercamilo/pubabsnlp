GSTA1 diplotypes affect busulfan clearance and toxicity in children undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a multicenter study.
Busulfan (BU) dose adjustment following therapeutic drug monitoring contributes to better outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Further improvement could be achieved through genotype-guided BU dose adjustments. To investigate this aspect, polymorphism within glutathione S transferase genes were assessed. Particularly, promoter haplotypes of the glutathione S transferase A1 (<i>GSTA1</i>) were evaluated <i>in vitro,</i> with reporter gene assays and clinically, in a pediatric multi-center study (N =138) through association with BU pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical outcomes. Promoter activity significantly differed between the <i>GSTA1</i> haplotypes (p<0.001) supporting their importance in capturing PK variability. Four <i>GSTA1</i> diplotype groups that significantly correlated with clearance (p=0.009) were distinguished. Diplotypes underlying fast and slow metabolizing capacity showed higher and lower BU clearance (ml/min/kg), respectively. <i>GSTA1</i> diplotypes with slow metabolizing capacity were associated with higher incidence of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, acute graft versus host disease and combined treatment-related toxicity (p<0.0005). Among other <i>GST</i> genes investigated, <i>GSTP1 313GG</i> correlated with acute graft versus host disease grade 1-4 (p=0.01) and <i>GSTM1 non-null</i> genotype was associated with hemorrhagic cystitis (p=0.003). This study further strengthens the hypothesis that <i>GST</i> diplotypes/genotypes could be incorporated into already existing population pharmacokinetic models for improving first BU dose prediction and HSCT outcomes.
