Genotyping of <i>UGT1A1*</i>80 as an Alternative to <i>UGT1A1*</i>28 Genotyping in Spain.
The variant rs34983651 (<i>UGT1A1</i>*28) and its genotyping are used to prevent irinotecan-induced toxicity. Several variants are in close linkage disequilibrium. Our objective was to evaluate the potential correlation of genotyping <i>UGT1A1</i>*80 instead of <i>UGT1A1</i>*28 in different populations.
