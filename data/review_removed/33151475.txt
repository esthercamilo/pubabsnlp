Pharmacogenetic profile and the development of the dyskinesia induced by levodopa-therapy in Parkinson's disease patients: a population-based cohort study.
Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is an adverse effect that negatively impacts the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies report that genetic variations in the genes of the pharmacogenetic pathway of the levodopa (L-DOPA) might be associated with LID development. The goal of the present study was to investigate a possible influence of functional genetic variants in the DRD1 (rs4532), DRD2 (rs1800497), DAT1 (rs28363170), and COMT (rs4680) genes with LID development. A total of 220 patients with idiopathic PD were enrolled. The genotyping for DRD1 (rs4532), DRD2 (rs1800497), DAT1 (rs28363170), and COMT (rs4680) polymorphisms were performed using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the association of these polymorphisms and risk factors with LID development. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed increased risk to LID development for both Levodopa Dose Equivalency (LED) (Hazard ratios (HR) = 1.001; 95% CI 1.00-1.01; p = 0.009) and individuals carrying the COMT L/L genotype (HR = 2.974; 95% CI 1.12-7.83; p = 0.010). Furthermore, when performed a Cox regression analysis adjusted for a total LED, we observed that the genotype COMT L/L had a 3.84-fold increased risk for LID development (HR = 3.841; 95% CI 1.29-11.37; p = 0.012). Our results suggest that before treating LID in PD patients, it is important to take into consideration genetic variant in the COMT gene, since COMT LL genotype may increase the risk for LID development.
