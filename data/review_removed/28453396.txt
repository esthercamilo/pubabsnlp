Pharmacogenetic analysis of hepatitis C virus related mixed cryoglobulinemia.
Mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) is an extra hepatic hepatitis C virus related problem and different studies suggested genetics' role in predicting this complication. We evaluated the influence of SNPs in IL-28B, SLC29A1, SLC28A2, NT5C2, HNF4 and ABCB1 genes in MC prediction.
