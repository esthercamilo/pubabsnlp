Personalised antiplatelet therapy based on pharmacogenomics in acute ischaemic minor stroke and transient ischaemic attack: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
Antiplatelet therapy combining aspirin and clopidogrel is considered to be a key intervention for acute ischaemic minor stroke (AIMS) and transient ischaemic attack (TIA). However, the interindividual variability in response to clopidogrel resulting from the polymorphisms in clopidogrel metabolism-related genes has greatly limited its efficacy. To date, there are no reports on individualised antiplatelet therapy for AIMS and TIA based on the genetic testing and clinical features. Therefore, we conduct this randomised controlled trial to validate the hypothesis that the individualised antiplatelet therapy selected on the basis of a combination of genetic information and clinical features would lead to better clinical outcomes compared with the standard care based only on clinical features in patients with AIMS or TIA.
