Brazilian cohort and genes encoding for drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters.
<b>Background & aim:</b> Genetic variability in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) genes contributes to the high heterogeneity of drug responses. The present study investigated polymorphisms of ADME genes frequencies and compared the findings with populations from other continents, available in the 1000 Genome Project (1 KGP) and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) databases. <b>Methodology & results:</b> We conducted a study of 100 patients in Brazil and a total of 2003 SNPs were evaluated by targeted next-generation sequencing in 148 genes, including Phase I enzymes (n = 50), Phase II enzymes (n = 38) and drug transporters (n = 60). Overall, the distribution of minor allele frequency (MAF) suggests that the distribution of 2003 SNPs is similar between Brazilian cohort, 1 KGP and ExAC; however, we found moderate SNP allele-frequency divergence between Brazilian cohort and both 1000 KGP and ExAC. These differences were observed in several relevant genes including <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>NAT2</i> and <i>SLCO1B1</i>. <b>Conclusion:</b> We concluded that the Brazilian population needs clinical assessment of drug treatment based on individual genotype rather than ethnicity.
