Physician liability: the next big thing for personalized medicine?
Liability is likely to be a major driver for the future direction and implementation of personalized medicine, spurring the adoption of genetic tests and other pharmacogenomic technologies, in some cases appropriately, and in other cases prematurely or as inefficient defensive medicine. While all entities in the personalized medicine chain will face liability risks, physicians will be at the greatest risk owing to their lack of defenses, limited experience in dealing with genetics and the growing disparities within the profession in implementing new medical technologies. The history of liability for genetic testing, primarily in the prenatal testing context, suggests that liability will often be both unpredictable and influential in changing medical practice. It is critical to anticipate and attempt to prevent such liability risks in a proactive manner so to minimize the disruptive impact that liability can cause.
