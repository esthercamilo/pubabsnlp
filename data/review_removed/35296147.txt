Use of a consultation service following pharmacogenetic testing in psychiatry.
The emerging discipline of pharmacogenetics (PGx) has the goal of aiding the selection of effective therapies and personalized dosing, decreasing the likelihood of adverse drug reactions and optimizing resource utilization. Simultaneously, the rapid evolution of economically feasible genetic testing technologies has resulted in a raft of commercial entities that provide genetic data to providers for use with their complex patients. The adoption of pharmacogenomics in psychiatry is growing, but it is limited by several factors, including the limitless permutations of drugs, comorbid conditions and concomitant medications and provider understanding of phenomena such as phenoconversion. We established an expert PGx consultation service for psychiatric providers who utilize our commercial PGx assay. To date, this service has provided ∼16,000 consults with extremely high levels of satisfaction; in an anonymous survey, 96% of respondents reported a rating of "very helpful" or "extremely helpful".
