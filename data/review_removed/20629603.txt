Impact of ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1 pharmacogenetics on tacrolimus-associated nephrotoxicity and dosage requirements in paediatric patients with liver transplant.
Tacrolimus is the most commonly used immunosuppressive agent following solid-organ transplantation in children. Its clinical use, however, is complicated by side effects (mainly nephrotoxicity), narrow therapeutic index and pharmacokinetic variability which can result in an increased risk of treatment failure or toxicity. Studies examining interindividual differences in the expression of the ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1) gene (which encodes the drug transporter, P-gp) and its genetic polymorphisms have attempted to elucidate variations in tacrolimus response and disposition in children.
