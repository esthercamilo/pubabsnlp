Association of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 metabolizer status with switching and discontinuing antidepressant drugs: an exploratory study.
Tailoring antidepressant drugs (AD) to patients' genetic drug-metabolism profile is promising. However, literature regarding associations of ADs' treatment effect and/or side effects with drug metabolizing genes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 has yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, our aim was to longitudinally investigate associations between CYP2D6 (poor, intermediate, and normal) and CYP2C19 (poor, intermediate, normal, and ultrarapid) metabolizer-status, and switching/discontinuing of ADs. Next, we investigated whether the number of perceived side effects differed between metabolizer statuses.
