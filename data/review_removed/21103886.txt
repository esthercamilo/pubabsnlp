Adrenergic α2A receptor gene is not associated with methylphenidate response in adults with ADHD.
Adrenergic α2A receptor gene (ADRA2A) is one of the most promising candidate genes for ADHD pharmacogenetics. Thus far, three studies have investigated the association between the ADRA2A -1291 C>G polymorphism and the therapeutic response to methylphenidate (MPH) in children with ADHD, all of them with positive results. The aim of this study is to investigate, for the first time, the association between three ADRA2A polymorphisms (-1291 C>G, -262 G>A, and 1780 C>T) and the response to MPH in adults with ADHD. The sample comprises 165 Brazilians of European descent evaluated in the adult ADHD outpatient clinic of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre. The diagnostic procedures followed the DSM-IV criteria. Drug response was assessed by both categorical and dimensional approaches, through the scales Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating scale version IV and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale, applied at the beginning and after the 30th day of treatment. We found no evidence of association between the three ADRA2A polymorphisms and the therapeutic response to MPH treatment. Our findings do not support a significant role for the ADRA2A gene in ADHD pharmacogenetics, at least among adult patients.
