CYP2C9 and CYP2C19: Deep Mutational Scanning and Functional Characterization of Genomic Missense Variants.
Single nucleotide variants in the open reading frames (ORFs) of pharmacogenes are important causes of interindividual variability in drug response. The functional characterization of variants of unknown significance within ORFs remains a major challenge for pharmacogenomics. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) is a high-throughput technique that makes it possible to analyze the functional effect of hundreds of variants in a parallel and scalable fashion. We adapted a "landing pad" DMS system to study the function of missense variants in the ORFs of cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 (CYP2C9) and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 19 (CYP2C19). We studied 230 observed missense variants in the CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 ORFs and found that 19 of 109 CYP2C9 and 36 of 121 CYP2C19 variants displayed less than ~Â 25% of the wild-type protein expression, a level that may have clinical relevance. Our results support DMS as an efficient method for the identification of damaging ORF variants that might have potential clinical pharmacogenomic application.
