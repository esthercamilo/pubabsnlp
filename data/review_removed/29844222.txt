The Role of Next-Generation Sequencing in Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics.
Inherited genetic variations in pharmacogenetic loci are widely acknowledged as important determinants of phenotypic differences in drug response, and may be actionable in the clinic. However, recent studies suggest that a considerable number of novel rare variants in pharmacogenes likely contribute to a still unexplained fraction of the observed interindividual variability. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) represents a rapid, relatively inexpensive, large-scale DNA sequencing technology with potential relevance as a comprehensive pharmacogenetic genotyping platform to identify genetic variation related to drug therapy. However, many obstacles remain before the clinical use of NGS-based test results, including technical challenges, functional interpretation, and strict requirements for diagnostic tests. Advanced computational analyses, high-throughput screening methodologies, and generation of shared resources with cell-based and clinical information will facilitate the integration of NGS data into candidate genotyping approaches, likely enhancing future drug phenotype predictions in patients.
