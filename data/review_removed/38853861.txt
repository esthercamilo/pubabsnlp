Clinical Predictors of 3-Months Isoniazid Rifapentine (3HP) - Related Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) During Tuberculosis Preventive Therapy. (PAnDoRA-3HP study): An Observational Study Protocol.
Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious cause of death globally. Despite WHO recommendations for Tuberculosis Preventive Therapy (TPT), challenges persist, including incompletion of treatment and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). There is limited data on the 3-month isoniazid and rifapentine (3HP) pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomics and their relation with ADRs. Our study aims to describe the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomics of 3HP used for TPT, the ADRs and their association with completion rates, and TPT outcomes, providing vital insights for TB control strategies in resource-limited settings.
