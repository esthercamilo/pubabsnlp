African Pharmacogenomics Consortium: Consolidating pharmacogenomics knowledge, capacity development and translation in Africa: Consolidating pharmacogenomics knowledge, capacity development and translation in Africa.
The African Pharmacogenomics Consortium (APC) was formally launched on the 6th September 2018. This white paper outlines its vision, and objectives towards addressing challenges of conducting and applying pharmacogenomics in Africa and identifies opportunities for advancement of individualized drugs use on the continent.  Africa, especially south of the Sahara, is beset with a huge burden of infectious diseases with much co-morbidity whose multiplicity and intersection are major challenges in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDG), SDG3, on health and wellness. The profile of drugs commonly used in African populations lead to a different spectrum of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) when compared to other parts of the world. Coupled with the genetic diversity among Africans, the APC is established to promote pharmacogenomics research and its clinical implementation for safe and effective use of medicine in the continent.  Variation in the way patients respond to treatment is mainly due to differences in activity of enzymes and transporters involved in pathways associated with each drug's disposition.  Knowledge of pharmacogenomics, therefore, helps in identifying genetic variants in these proteins and their functional effects. Africa needs to consolidate its pharmacogenomics expertise and technological platforms to bring pharmacogenomics to use.
