Tamsulosin Associated with Interstitial Lung Damage in CYP2D6 Variant Alleles Carriers.
Drugs are serious but underestimated causative agents of interstitial lung disease (ILD). Both cytotoxic and immune mechanisms may be involved in drug-induced ILD (DI-ILD). We aimed to investigate whether polymorphisms of relevant CYP enzymes involved in the metabolization of tamsulosin might explain the pathologic mechanism of the DI-ILD in the cases with suspected tamsulosin DI-ILD. We collected 22 tamsulosin-associated DI-ILD cases at two ILD Expertise Centers in the Netherlands between 2009 and 2020. CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped and compared with a control group of 78 healthy Caucasian male volunteers. Nine cases were phenotyped as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and 13 as CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. The phenotypes of the cases differed significantly from those of the healthy controls, with more poor metabolizers. After withdrawal of tamsulosin, the pulmonary condition of three cases had improved, six patients had stabilized, and one patient stabilized after reducing the tamsulosin dose. The described 22 cases suggest that an association between the presence of CYP2D6 allelic variants and tamsulosin-associated ILD is highly likely. These cases highlight the importance of both clinical and genetic risk stratification aimed to achieve a more accurate prevention of DI-ILD in the future and enhance the quality of life of patients.
