Nutri-pharmacogenomics of warfarin anticoagulation therapy: VKORC1 genotype-dependent influence of dietary vitamin K intake.
Warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant, but large interindividual variations exist in the dose required to achieve comparable therapeutic effects. Several clinical and genetic variables have been identified that influence warfarin dosing. However, interactions between genotype and nutrition remain uncertain in terms of dietary vitamin K intake. To investigate genotype-nutrient interactions in warfarin anticoagulation therapy, 202 consecutive outpatients (M/F = 142/60, mean age, 69 years) undergoing treatment with warfarin were enrolled. Prevalent single nucleotide polymorphisms in VKORC1 and CYP2C9 were genotyped, and dietary vitamin K intake during the week preceding the blood sampling was quantitatively estimated by a dietitian-assisted questionnaire. Patients were classified according to low, medium, or high vitamin K intake. The mean daily warfarin dose in subjects with a VKORC1-1639 A/A genotype was significantly smaller than that with a -1639A/G genotype (2.74 vs. 3.91 mg/day, respectively, p < 0.0001). Dose requirements did not differ between subjects with a CYP2C9 *1/*3 genotype versus a CYP2C9 *1/*1 genotype. In subjects with a variant VKORC1-1639 G allele, the mean daily warfarin dose was significantly attenuated by low vitamin K intake compared with medium and high intake after adjustment for covariates (3.4 vs. 5.0 vs. 4.0 mg/day, respectively, p = 0.028). No such genotype effects were observed in homozygous patients for the VKORC1-1639 A allele. The results of the present study suggest that the capacity of dietary vitamin K intake to influence warfarin dose requirements during anticoagulation therapy is VKORC1 genotype-dependent, at least in part.
