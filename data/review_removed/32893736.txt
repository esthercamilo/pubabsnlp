The role of pharmacogenomics in the personalization of Parkinson's disease treatment.
Parkinson's disease (PD)-related phenotypes can vary among patients substantially, including response to dopaminergic treatment in terms of efficacy and occurrence of adverse events. Many pharmacogenetic studies have already been conducted to find genetic markers of response to dopaminergic treatment. Integration of genetic and clinical data hasÂ already resulted in construction of clinical pharmacogenetic models for prediction of adverse events. However, the results of pharmacogenetic studies are inconsistent. More comprehensive genome-wide approaches are needed to find genetic biomarkers of PD-related phenotypes to better explain the variability in response to treatment. These genetic markers should be integrated with clinical, environmental, imaging, and other omics data to build clinically useful algorithms for personalization of PD management.
