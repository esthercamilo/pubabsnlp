Pharmacogenomics of second-line drugs used for treatment of unresponsive or relapsed osteosarcoma patients.
Second-line treatment of high-grade osteosarcoma (HGOS) patients is based on different approaches and chemotherapy protocols, which are not yet standardized. Although several drugs have been used in HGOS second-line protocols, none of them has provided fully satisfactory results and the role of rescue chemotherapy is not well defined yet. This article focuses on the drugs that have most frequently been used for second-line treatment of HGOS, highlighting the present knowledge on their mechanisms of action and resistance and on gene polymorphisms with possible impact on treatment sensitivity or toxicity. In the near future, validation of the so far identified candidate genetic biomarkers may constitute the basis for tailoring treatment by taking the patients' genetic background into account.
