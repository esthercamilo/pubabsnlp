Azole antifungals and inter-individual differences in drug metabolism: the role of pharmacogenomics and precision medicine.
Azole antifungal drugs are commonly prescribed to treat invasive fungal infections in various disease conditions. However, these drugs are substrates and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, UGT1A4, and P-gp. The genetic variants of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, ABCB1, or UGT1A4 can modify the safety or effectiveness of azole antifungals.
