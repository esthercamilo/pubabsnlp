Are Community Pharmacists Ready to Deliver Pharmacogenomics Testing Services?
This study assesses the readiness and willingness of community pharmacists in England to deliver the pharmacogenomic (PG) testing service. A survey covering demographics and four key themes including awareness and training, general views and experience, barriers, willingness, and confidence was distributed to community pharmacies in the boroughs of Croydon and Sutton in South London. A total of 51 pharmacists responded to the survey. The study revealed that most respondents had a limited familiarity or understanding of pharmacogenomics (<i>n</i> = 32, 63%). Moreover, on average, around 60% of participants were unable to accurately identify drugs that currently have or could have potentials for PG testing. They indicated that their pharmacogenomic education and training is inadequate, with only 2/51 pharmacists reported receiving relevant training. Time constraints, shortage of staff and lack of knowledge were identified as barriers that could hinder the implementation of PG. Over 60% of respondents expressed willingness to provide PG testing service after receiving adequate training. The study found that currently not all community pharmacists are prepared to provide PG testing services, with newly qualified pharmacists appearing to have an upper hand when it comes to understanding the subject. Therefore, consistent, and uniform training is required to allow community pharmacists with all years of experience to equally contribute to the implementation of PG testing.
