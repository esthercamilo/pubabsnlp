The pharmacogenomics of membrane transporters project: research at the interface of genomics and transporter pharmacology.
Since the cloning of the first membrane transporter, our understanding of the role of transporters in clinical drug disposition and response has grown enormously. In parallel, large-scale genome-wide variation studies and the emerging field of pharmacogenomics have ushered in a new understanding of variations in drug response. At the crossroads of pharmacogenomics and transporter biology is the National Institutes of Health-funded Pharmacogenomics of Membrane Transporters (PMT) project, centered at the University of California, San Francisco.
