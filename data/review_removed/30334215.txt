A Platform for Comprehensive Genomic Profiling in Human Cancers and Pharmacogenomics Therapy Selection.
Recent innovations in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling of human cancers in the clinical setting. The ability to profile has launched a worldwide trend known as precision medicine, and the fusion of genomic profiling and pharmacogenomics is paving the way for precision medicine for cancer. The profiling is coupled with information about chemical therapies available to patients with specific genotypes. As a result, the chemogenomic space in play is not only the standard chemical and genome space but also the mutational genome and chemical space. In this chapter, we introduce clinical genomic profiling using an NGS-based multiplex gene assay (OncoPrimeâ„¢) at Kyoto University Hospital.
