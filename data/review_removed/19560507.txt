Interaction of serotonin-related genes affects short-term antidepressant response in major depressive disorder.
Four serotonin-related genes including guanine nucleotide binding protein beta polypeptide 3 (GNB3), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (HTR1A; serotonin receptor 1A), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A; serotonin receptor 2A), and solute carrier family 6 member 4 (SLC6A4; serotonin neurotransmitter transporter) have been suggested to be candidate genes for influencing antidepressant treatment outcome. The aim of this study was to explore whether interaction among these genes could contribute to the pharmacogenomics of short-term antidepressant response in a Taiwanese population with major depressive disorder (MDD).
