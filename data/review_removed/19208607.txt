Metaanalysis of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms affecting methotrexate toxicity.
Methotrexate (MTX) is an effective therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but it is also associated with toxicity. Pharmacogenetics is the systematic evaluation of the role of genetic differences in the efficacy and toxicity of therapeutic interventions. Because the results of small pharmacogenetic studies are often misleading, we undertook a metaanalysis of published studies to determine the role of polymorphisms in the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of MTX.
