Association of CYP2C19*2 and associated haplotypes with lower norendoxifen concentrations in tamoxifen-treated Asian breast cancer patients.
The aim was to examine the influence of CYP2C19 variants and associated haplotypes on the disposition of tamoxifen and its metabolites, particularly norendoxifen (NorEND), in Asian patients with breast cancer.
