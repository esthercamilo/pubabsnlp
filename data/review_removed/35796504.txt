Current and future physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approaches to optimize pharmacotherapy in preterm neonates.
There is a need for structured approaches to inform on pharmacotherapy in preterm neonates. With their proven track record up to regulatory acceptance, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation provide a structured approach, and hold the promise to support drug development in preterm neonates.
