[Using the theory of precision medicine to optimize the multidisciplinary comprehensive treatment of prostate cancer].
In recent years, morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer in China have increased rapidly, and it has become a common malignant tumor among the top 5 male tumors in some areas. Multidisciplinary comprehensive treatment is the key to improve the survival rate and quality of life of prostate cancer. However, the drugs used to construct multidisciplinary comprehensive treatment were based on anatomy, treatment stage and clinical trials, which lacked individualized treatment for complex tumor scenarios. With the rapid development of precision medicine, molecular imaging, molecular typing and pharmacogenomics will be added to these three elements, which will help to improve the individualized level of multidisciplinary comprehensive treatment. This kind of precise multidisciplinary comprehensive treatment urgently needs the vigorous promotion of ideas, researchers and researches.
