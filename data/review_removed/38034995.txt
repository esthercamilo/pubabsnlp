Construction of a risk scoring system using clinical factors and <i>RYR2</i> polymorphisms for bleeding complications in patients on direct oral anticoagulants.
<b>Introduction:</b> Bleeding is one of the most undesirable complications of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). While the ryanodine receptor (<i>RYR2</i>) has been related to cardiac diseases, research on bleeding complications is lacking. This study aimed to elucidate the association between <i>RYR2</i> and bleeding risk to develop the risk scoring system in patients treated with DOACs. <b>Methods:</b> This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected samples. We selected ten SNPs within the <i>RYR2</i> gene, and two models were constructed (Model I: demographic factors only, Model II: demographic and genetic factors) in multivariable analysis. Independent risk factors for bleeding were used to develop a risk scoring system. <b>Results:</b> A total of 447 patients were included, and 49 experienced either major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding. In Model I, patients using rivaroxaban and experiencing anemia exhibited an increased bleeding risk after adjusting for covariates. Upon incorporating genetic factors into Model I, a significant association with bleeding was also observed in cases of overdosing on DOACs and in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30Â mL/min, in addition to rivaroxaban and anemia (Model II). Among genetic factors, <i>RYR2</i> rs12594 GG, rs17682073 AA, rs3766871 GG, and rs6678625 T alleles were associated with bleeding complications. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of Model I was 0.670, whereas that of Model II increased to 0.803, demonstrating better performance with the inclusion of genetic factors. Using the significant variables in Model II, a risk scoring system was constructed. The predicted bleeding risks for scores of 0, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and 9-10 points were 0%, 1.2%, 4.6%, 15.7%, 41.7%, and 73.3%, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study revealed an association between <i>RYR2</i> and bleeding complications among patients taking DOACs and established a risk scoring system to support individualized DOAC treatment for these patients.
