Pharmacogenomics education in medical and pharmacy schools: conclusions of a global survey.
<b>Aim:</b> The need for pharmacogenomic education is becoming more and more urgent. Our aim was to evaluate the progress in pharmacogenomics education since then, and to put forward further recommendations. <b>Methods:</b> A survey was sent to 248 schools of medicine, pharmacy, nursing and health professions around the world. <b>Results:</b> The majority of the study programs (87%) include pharmacogenomics education, which is generally taught as part of the pharmacology curriculum. On average, educators and teachers have selected appropriate and highly relevant pharmacogenomics biomarkers to include in their teaching programs. <b>Conclusions:</b> Based on the results, we can conclude that the state of pharmacogenomics education at the surveyed universities has improved substantially since 2005.
