Stability of Anticoagulation Following Acenocoumarin in Stroke Patients: Role of Pharmacogenomics and Acquired Factors.
Pharmacogenomics plays an important role in drug metabolism. A stable anticoagulation is important for primary and secondary prevention of cardioembolic stroke and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). We report the role of cytochrome P450 ( CYP2C9*2/*3 ) and vitamin K epoxide reductase subunit 1 ( VKORC1 ) genotypes and acquired causes in maintaining stability of anticoagulation following acenocoumarin in cardioembolic stroke and CVST.
