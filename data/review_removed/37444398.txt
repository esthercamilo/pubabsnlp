In Vitro and In Vivo Drug-Response Profiling Using Patient-Derived High-Grade Glioma.
Genomic profiling cannot solely predict the complexity of how tumor cells behave in their in vivo microenvironment and their susceptibility to therapies. The aim of the study was to establish a functional drug prediction model utilizing patient-derived GBM tumor samples for in vitro testing of drug efficacy followed by in vivo validation to overcome the disadvantages of a strict pharmacogenomics approach.
