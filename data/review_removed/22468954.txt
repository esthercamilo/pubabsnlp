Third-generation sequencing techniques and applications to drug discovery.
There is an immediate need for functional and molecular studies to decipher differences between disease and 'normal' settings to identify large quantities of validated targets with the highest therapeutic utilities. Furthermore, drug mechanism of action and biomarkers to predict drug efficacy and safety need to be identified for effective design of clinical trials, decreasing attrition rates, regulatory agency approval process and drug repositioning. By expanding the power of genetics and pharmacogenetics studies, next-generation nucleic acid sequencing technologies have started to play an important role in all stages of drug discovery.
