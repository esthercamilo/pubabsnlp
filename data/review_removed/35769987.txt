Allopurinol-Induced Stevens-Johnson Syndrome in Javanese Men With Positive HLA-B*58:01.
<b>Background:</b> Allopurinol is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of gout arthritis. However, the use of allopurinol is associated with severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) and life-threatening immune-mediated reactions that include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). SJS induced by allopurinol is strongly linked with the presence of <i>HLA-B*58:01</i> in the Asian population. Such a study has not been conducted in Indonesia. We present two cases with clinical diagnosis of SJS. These patients had Javanese ethnicity, for which evidence on the genetic predisposition of allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN had not been established. Testing for the presence of the <i>HLA-Bâˆ—58:01</i> allele was positive in both cases. Our case report confirms findings from studies in Asian countries that link <i>HLA-B*58:01</i> and allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN. A larger study is needed to elicit evidence that the <i>HLA-B*58:01</i> allele can potentially be used as a genetic marker for allopurinol-induced SCARs among different ethnicities in Indonesia.
