Personalized Medicine and Mood Disorders.
Some of the latest advances in personalized psychiatry with future research directions are discussed in this article. Many factors contribute to the phenotypic psychiatric profile in individual patients. These overlapping factors include but are not limited to genetics, epigenetics, central nervous system circuit alterations, family history, past personal history, environmental influences including early life stress, and more recent life stressors. The authors discuss the role of pharmacogenomics, particularly in the cytochrome P450 enzyme system in relation to treatment response. Despite some promising advances in personalized medicine in psychiatry, it is still in its early phases of development.
