Link synthetic lethality to drug sensitivity of cancer cells.
Synthetic lethal (SL) interactions occur when alterations in two genes lead to cell death but alteration in only one of them is not lethal. SL interactions provide a new strategy for molecular-targeted cancer therapy. Currently, there are few drugs targeting SL interactions that entered into clinical trials. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the link between SL interactions and drug sensitivity of cancer cells systematically for drug development purpose. We identified SL interactions by integrating the high-throughput data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, small hairpin RNA data and genetic interactions of yeast. By integrating SL interactions from other studies, we tested whether the SL pairs that consist of drug target genes and the genes with genomic alterations are related with drug sensitivity of cancer cells. We found that only 6.26%âˆ¼34.61% of SL interactions showed the expected significant drug sensitivity using the pooled cancer cell line data from different tissues, but the proportion increased significantly to approximately 90% using the cancer cell line data for each specific tissue. From an independent pharmacogenomics data of 41 breast cancer cell lines, we found three SL interactions (ABL1-IFI16, ABL1-SLC50A1 and ABL1-SYT11) showed significantly better prognosis for the patients with both genes being altered than the patients with only one gene being altered, which partially supports the SL effect between the gene pairs. Our study not only provides a new way for unraveling the complex mechanisms of drug sensitivity but also suggests numerous potentially important drug targets for cancer therapy.
