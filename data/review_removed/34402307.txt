Defining the role of pharmacists in medication-related genetic counseling.
There is little question that precision medicine will eventually be the standard of care in treatment with algorithms designed for therapy selection and is already being used in some specialties such as cystic fibrosis and multiple cancer treatments. Genetic counselors are the heart of the treatment team in relation to counseling regarding genetic risk factors and disease states. A framework for treatment within the interdisciplinary team with more defined roles and areas of specialty will need to be in place as this practice approach expands with new data and treatments. Pharmacists are poised to be of great assistance in this matrix as many of these roles are merely an extension of current tasks and responsibilities of pharmacy practice.
