Polymorphism in CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, members of the cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system, in the metabolism of psychotropic drugs.
Numerous studies in the field of psychopharmacological treatment have investigated the possible contribution of genetic variability between individuals to differences in drug efficacy and safety, motivated by the wide individual variation in treatment response. Genomewide analyses have been conducted in several large-scale studies on antidepressant drug response. However, no consistent findings have emerged from these studies. In a recent meta-analysis of genomewide data from the three studies capturing common variation for association with symptomatic improvement and remission revealed the absence of any strong genetic association and failed to replicate results of individual studies in the pooled data. However, there are good reasons to consider the possible importance of pharmacogenetic variants separately. These variants explain a large portion of the manifold variability in individual drug metabolism. More than 20 psychotropic drugs have now been relabelled by the FDA adding information on polymorphic drug metabolism and therapeutic recommendations. Furthermore, dose recommendations for polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes, first and foremost CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, have been issued with the advice to reduce the dosage in poor metabolizers to 50% or less (in eight cases), or to choose an alternative treatment. Beside the well-described role in hepatic drug metabolism, these enzymes are also expressed in the brain and play a role in biotransformation of endogenous substrates. These polymorphisms may therefore modulate brain metabolism and affect the function of the neural substrates of cognition and emotion.
