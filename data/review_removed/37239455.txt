The Role of Pharmacogenetics in Personalizing the Antidepressant and Anxiolytic Therapy.
Pharmacotherapy for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression, has been characterized by significant inter-individual variability in drug response and the development of side effects. Pharmacogenetics, as a key part of personalized medicine, aims to optimize therapy according to a patient's individual genetic signature by targeting genetic variations involved in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic processes. Pharmacokinetic variability refers to variations in a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination, whereas pharmacodynamic variability results from variable interactions of an active drug with its target molecules. Pharmacogenetic research on depression and anxiety has focused on genetic polymorphisms affecting metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, P-glycoprotein ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and monoamine and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolic enzymes, transporters, and receptors. Recent pharmacogenetic studies have revealed that more efficient and safer treatments with antidepressants and anxiolytics could be achieved through genotype-guided decisions. However, because pharmacogenetics cannot explain all observed heritable variations in drug response, an emerging field of pharmacoepigenetics investigates how epigenetic mechanisms, which modify gene expression without altering the genetic code, might influence individual responses to drugs. By understanding the epi(genetic) variability of a patient's response to pharmacotherapy, clinicians could select more effective drugs while minimizing the likelihood of adverse reactions and therefore improve the quality of treatment.
