Sex Differences in Opioid Response Linked to <i>OPRM1</i> and <i>COMT</i> genes DNA Methylation/Genotypes Changes in Patients with Chronic Pain.
Analgesic-response variability in chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) has been reported due to several biological and environmental factors. This study was undertaken to explore sex differences linked to <i>OPRM1</i> and <i>COMT</i> DNA methylation changes and genetic variants in analgesic response. A retrospective study with 250 real-world CNCP outpatients was performed in which data from demographic, clinical, and pharmacological variables were collected. DNA methylation levels (CpG island) were evaluated by pyrosequencing, and their interaction with the <i>OPRM1</i> (A118G) and <i>COMT</i> (G472A) gene polymorphisms was studied. A priori-planned statistical analyses were conducted to compare responses between females and males. Sex-differential <i>OPRM1</i> DNA methylation was observed to be linked to lower opioid use disorder (OUD) cases for females (<i>p</i> = 0.006). Patients with lower <i>OPRM1</i> DNA methylation and the presence of the mutant G-allele reduced opioid dose requirements (<i>p</i> = 0.001), equal for both sexes. Moreover, <i>COMT</i> DNA methylation levels were negatively related to pain relief (<i>p</i> = 0.020), quality of life (<i>p</i> = 0.046), and some adverse events (probability > 90%) such as constipation, insomnia, or nervousness. Females were, significantly, 5 years older with high anxiety levels and a different side-effects distribution than males. The analyses demonstrated significant differences between females and males related to <i>OPRM1</i> signalling efficiency and OUD, with a genetic-epigenetic interaction in opioid requirements. These findings support the importance of sex as a biological variable to be factored into chronic pain-management studies.
