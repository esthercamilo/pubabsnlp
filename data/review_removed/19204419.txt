Assessing patient readiness for the clinical adoption of personalized medicine.
Although pharmacogenomics-based diagnostics and therapeutics are increasingly being translated into personalized medicine applications, relatively little evidence exists about how novel pharmacogenomics-based technologies will be accepted and adopted by patients. It is important to understand the characteristics of genomic diagnostics and targeted therapeutics that might impact utilization or serve as barriers to adoption of these novel technologies in order to formulate appropriate policies and procedures. The objective of this study was to investigate patients' understanding and knowledge of personalized medicine and the process of decision-making regarding pharmacogenomics testing and targeted therapeutics and to better understand how patients value receiving pharmacogenomics-based care.
