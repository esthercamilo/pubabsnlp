Application of long-read sequencing to elucidate complex pharmacogenomic regions: a proof of principle.
The use of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice is becoming standard of care. However, due to the complex genetic makeup of pharmacogenes, not all genetic variation is currently accounted for. Here, we show the utility of long-read sequencing to resolve complex pharmacogenes by analyzing a well-characterised sample. This data consists of long reads that were processed to resolve phased haploblocks. 73% of pharmacogenes were fully covered in one phased haploblock, including 9/15 genes that are 100% complex. Variant calling accuracy in the pharmacogenes was high, with 99.8% recall and 100% precision for SNVs and 98.7% precision and 98.0% recall for Indels. For the majority of gene-drug interactions in the DPWG and CPIC guidelines, the associated genes could be fully resolved (62% and 63% respectively). Together, these findings suggest that long-read sequencing data offers promising opportunities in elucidating complex pharmacogenes and haplotype phasing while maintaining accurate variant calling.
