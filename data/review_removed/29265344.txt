Pharmacogenetics of KCNQ channel activation in 2 potassium channelopathy mouse models of epilepsy.
Antiseizure drugs are the leading therapeutic choice for treatment of epilepsy, but their efficacy is limited by pharmacoresistance and the occurrence of unwanted side effects. Here, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of KCNQ channel activation by retigabine in preventing seizures and neurocardiac dysfunction in 2 potassium channelopathy mouse models of epilepsy with differing severity that have been associated with increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP): the Kcna1<sup>-/-</sup> model of severe epilepsy and the Kcnq1<sup>A340E/A340E</sup> model of mild epilepsy.
