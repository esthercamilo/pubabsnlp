Towards population-specific pharmacogenomics in the era of next-generation sequencing.
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) has essential roles in identifying optimal drug responders, optimizing dosage regimens and avoiding adverse events. Population-specific therapeutic interventions that tackle the genetic root causes of clinical outcomes are an important precision medicine strategy. In this perspective, we discuss next-generation sequencing genotyping and its significance for population-specific PGx applications. We emphasize the potential of NGS for preemptive pharmacogenotyping, which is crucial to population-specific clinical studies and patient care. We also provide examples that use publicly available population-based genomics data for population-specific PGx studies. Last, we discuss the remaining challenges and regulatory efforts towards improvements in this field.
