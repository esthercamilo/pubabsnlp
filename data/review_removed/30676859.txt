Tamoxifen Pharmacogenetics and Metabolism: Results From the Prospective CYPTAM Study.
Tamoxifen is widely prescribed as adjuvant therapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer. It has been postulated that concentrations of endoxifen, the active metabolite of tamoxifen, are a better predictor of tamoxifen efficacy than CYP2D6 genotypes. Although in a retrospective study, an endoxifen threshold of 5.9 ng/mL for efficacy was described, confirmation based on prospective studies is lacking. The objective of the prospective CYPTAM (The Netherlands National Trial Register: NTR1509) study was to associate endoxifen concentrations and CYP2D6 genotypes with clinical outcome in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving tamoxifen.
