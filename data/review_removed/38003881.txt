Food Administration and Not Genetic Variants Causes Pharmacokinetic Variability of Tadalafil and Finasteride.
Tadalafil and finasteride are used in combination for the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Genetic variations in genes involved in the metabolism and transport of tadalafil or finasteride (i.e., pharmacogenes) could affect their pharmacokinetic processes altering their drug exposure, efficacy, and toxicity. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of variants in pharmacogenes on the pharmacokinetics of tadalafil and finasteride. An exploratory candidate gene study involving 120 variants in 33 genes was performed with 66 male healthy volunteers from two bioequivalence clinical trials after administration of tadalafil/finasteride 5 mg/5 mg under fed or fasting conditions. Afterwards, a confirmatory study was conducted with 189 male and female volunteers receiving tadalafil 20 mg formulations in seven additional bioequivalence clinical trials. Regarding tadalafil, fed volunteers showed higher area in the time-concentration curve (AUC<sub>∞</sub>), maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), and time to reach C<sub>max</sub> (t<sub>max</sub>) compared to fasting volunteers; male volunteers also showed higher AUC<sub>∞</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> compared to female volunteers. Furthermore, fed volunteers presented higher finasteride AUC<sub>∞</sub>, C<sub>max</sub> and t<sub>max</sub> compared to fasting individuals. Variants in <i>ABCC3</i>, <i>CYP1A2</i>, <i>CES1</i>, <i>NUDT15</i>, <i>SLC22A1/A2</i> and <i>UGT2B10</i> were nominally associated with pharmacokinetic variation in tadalafil and/or finasteride but did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Genetic variation did not demonstrate to clinically impact on the pharmacokinetics of finasteride and tadalafil; however, additional studies with larger sample sizes are needed to assess the effect of rare variants, such as <i>CYP3A4*20</i> or <i>*22</i>, on tadalafil and finasteride pharmacokinetics.
