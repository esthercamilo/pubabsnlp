Genetic determinants of high on-treatment platelet reactivity in clopidogrel treated Chinese patients.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP), ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCB1), and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) play crucial roles in clopidogel absorption and bioactivation. Genetic polymorphisms in these genes have been associated with the variability of the response to clopidogrel, however their contribution to high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) in clopidogrel treated Chinese patients is less known.
