Association Study of the Complement Component C4 Gene in Tardive Dyskinesia.
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder that may develop in schizophrenia patients being treated long-term with antipsychotic medication. TD interferes with voluntary movements and leads to stigma, and can be associated with treatment non-adherence. The etiology of TD is unclear, but it appears to have a genetic component. There is emerging evidence of immune dysregulation in TD. In the current study, we set out to investigate the complex schizophrenia-associated complement component 4 (<i>C4</i>) gene for possible association with TD occurrence and TD severity as assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) in a sample of 129 schizophrenia patients of European ancestry. We have genotyped the copy numbers of long and short forms of <i>C4</i>A and <i>C4</i>B gene variants in 129 European ancestry patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. We did not find predicted <i>C4</i>A or <i>C4</i>B expression to be nominally associated with TD risk or severity. However, we found the number of copies of <i>C4</i>BL to be nominally associated with TD severity (<i>p</i> = 0.020).
