<i>MTNR1B</i> Gene Polymorphisms Are Associated With the Therapeutic Responses to Repaglinide in Chinese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
The objective of this study was to investigate whether <i>MTNR1B</i> gene variants influence repaglinide response in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 300 patients with T2DM and 200 control subjects were enrolled to identify <i>MTNR1B</i> rs10830963 and rs1387153 genotypes by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with subsequent high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. Ninety-five patients with newly diagnosed T2DM were randomly selected to undergo 8 weeks of repaglinide treatment (3 mg/day). After 8-week repaglinide monotherapy, patients with at least one G allele of <i>MTNR1B</i> rs10830963 showed a smaller decrease in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (<i>P</i> = 0.031) and a smaller increase in homeostasis model assessment for beta cell function (HOMA-B) (<i>P</i> = 0.002) levels than those with the CC genotype did. The T allele carriers at rs1387153 exhibited a smaller decrease in FPG (<i>P</i> = 0.007) and smaller increases in postprandial serum insulin (PINS) (<i>P</i> = 0.016) and HOMA-B (<i>P</i> < 0.001) levels compared to individuals with the CC genotype. These data suggest that the <i>MTNR1B</i> rs10830963 and rs1387153 polymorphisms are associated with repaglinide monotherapy efficacy in Chinese patients with T2DM.
