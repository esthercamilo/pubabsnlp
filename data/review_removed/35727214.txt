<i>ABCB1</i> and <i>OPRM1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphisms collectively modulate chronic shoulder pain and dysfunction in South African breast cancer survivors.
<b>Background:</b> Chronic shoulder pain/disability is a well-recognized side effect of treatment for breast cancer, with ∼40% of patients experiencing this, despite receiving pain management. To manage acute and chronic pain, several opioids are commonly prescribed. Pharmacogenomics have implicated genes within the opioid signaling pathway, including <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>OPRM1</i>, to contribute to an individual's variable response to opioids. <b>Aim:</b> To evaluate <i>ABCB1</i> (rs1045642 G>A, rs1128503 G>A) and <i>OPRM1</i> (rs1799971 A>G, rs540825 T>A) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in chronic shoulder pain/disability in BCS. <b>Materials & methods:</b> TaqMan<sup>TM</sup> assays were used to genotype <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>OPRM1</i> SNPs within the BCS (N = 252) cohort. The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index was used to evaluate pain and disability features associated with shoulder pathologies. Participants end scores for each feature (pain, disability and combined [pain and disability]) were categorized into no-low (>30%) and moderate-high (≥30%) scores. Statistical analysis was applied, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05. <b>Results:</b> Of participants, 27.0, 19.0 and 22.0% reported moderate-high pain, disability and combined (pain and disability) scores, respectively. <i>ABCB1</i>:rs1045642-(A/A) genotype was significantly associated with disability (p = 0.028: no-low [14.9%] vs mod-high [4.3%]) and combined (pain and disability) (p = 0.011: no-low [15.9%] vs mod-high [5.7%]). The <i>ABCB1</i>:rs1045642-(A) allele was significantly associated with disability (p = 0.015: no-low [37.9%] vs mod-high [23.9%]) and combined (pain and disability) (p = 0.003: no-low [38.5%] vs mod-high [23.6%]). The inferred <i>ABCB1</i> (rs1045642 G>A - rs1128503 G>A): A-G (p = 0.029; odds ratio [OR]: 0.0; 95% CI: 0.0-0.0) and the <i>OPRM1</i> (rs1799971 A>G - rs540825 T>A): G-T (p = 0.019; OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.14-0.75) haplotypes were associated with disability and pain, respectively. Gene-gene interactions showed the <i>ABCB1</i> (rs1045642 G>A) - <i>OPRM1</i> (rs540825 T>A) combinations, (A-T) (p = 0.019; OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.33-1.16) and (G-A) (p = 0.021; OR: 1.57; 95% CI: 0.30-3.10) were associated with disability. <b>Conclusion:</b> The study implicated <i>ABCB1</i> with shoulder pain and disability; and haplotype analyses identified specific genetic intervals within <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>OPRM1</i> to associate with chronic shoulder pain and disability. Evidence suggests that potentially gene-gene interactions between <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>OPRM1</i> contribute to chronic shoulder pain and disability experienced in this SA cohort.
