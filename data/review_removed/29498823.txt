Pharmacogenomics and the Placebo Response.
There is perhaps no more important time in the history of placebos to consider their role in clinical trials and in medicine. Increasingly well-designed pharmaceutical and academic clinical trials testing promising and established drug and surgical interventions have failed to "beat" the placebo response. The collateral damage resulting from these failures is staggering; novel treatments, many with compelling mechanisms of action and promising Phase 2 trial results, never reach the patient, adversely affecting small and large pharma alike. Recent evidence suggests that variability in placebo response may be attributed in part to genetic variation. Thus, having a better understanding of the genomic underpinnings of the placebo response, the "placebome", may pave the way to innovatively and more effectively use placebos in drug development.
