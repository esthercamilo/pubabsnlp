NAT2 phenotype alters pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in healthy volunteers.
Rivaroxaban is a direct inhibitor of factor Xa, a member of direct oral anticoagulant group of drugs (DOACs). Despite being a widely extended alternative to vitamin K antagonists (i.e., acenocoumarol, warfarin) the interindividual variability of DOACs is significant, and may be related to adverse drug reaction occurrence or drug inefficacy, namely hemorrhagic or thromboembolic events. Since there is not a consistent analytic practice to monitor the anticoagulant activity of DOACs, previously reported polymorphisms in genes coding for proteins responsible for the activation, transport, or metabolism of DOACs were studied. The study population comprised 60 healthy volunteers, who completed two randomized, crossover bioequivalence clinical trials between two different rivaroxaban formulations. The effect of food, sex, biogeographical origin and 55 variants (8 phenotypes and 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms) in drug metabolizing enzyme genes (such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, NAT2) and transporters (namely, ABCB1, ABCG2) on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics was tested. Individuals dosed under fasting conditions presented lower t<sub>max</sub> (2.21 h vs 2.88 h, β = 1.19, R<sup>2</sup> =0.342, p = 0.012) compared to fed volunteers. NAT2 slow acetylators presented higher AUC<sub>∞</sub> corrected by dose/weight (AUC<sub>∞</sub>/DW; 8243.90 vs 7698.20 and 7161.25 h*ng*mg /ml*kg, β = 0.154, R<sup>2</sup> =0.250, p = 0.044), higher C<sub>max</sub>/DW (1070.99 vs 834.81 and 803.36 ng*mg /ml*kg, β = 0.245, R<sup>2</sup> =0.320, p = 0.002), and lower t<sub>max</sub> (2.63 vs 3.19 and 4.15 h, β = -0.346, R<sup>2</sup> =0.282, p = 0.047) than NAT2 rapid and intermediate acetylators. No other association was statistically significant. Thus, slow NAT2 appear to have altered rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics, increasing AUC<sub>∞</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>. Nonetheless, further research should be conducted to verify NAT2 involvement on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and to determine its clinical significance.
