Systems Approaches to Treatment Response to Imatinib in Severe Asthma: A Pilot Study.
There is an acute need for advances in pharmacologic therapies and a better understanding of novel drug targets for severe asthma. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to improve forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) in a clinical trial of patients with severe asthma. In a pilot study, we applied systems biology approaches to epithelium gene expression from these clinical trial patients treated with imatinib to better understand lung function response with imatinib treatment. Bronchial brushings from ten imatinib-treated patient samples and 14 placebo-treated patient samples were analyzed. We used personalized perturbation profiles (PEEPs) to characterize gene expression patterns at the individual patient level. We found that strong responders-patients with greater than 20% increase in FEV<sub>1</sub>-uniquely shared multiple downregulated mitochondrial-related pathways. In comparison, weak responders (5-10% FEV<sub>1</sub> increase), and non-responders to imatinib shared none of these pathways. The use of PEEP highlights its potential for application as a systems biology tool to develop individual-level approaches to predicting disease phenotypes and response to treatment in populations needing innovative therapies. These results support a role for mitochondrial pathways in airflow limitation in severe asthma and as potential therapeutic targets in larger clinical trials.
