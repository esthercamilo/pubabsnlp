Interdisciplinary Collaboration Among Nursing and Computer Science to Refine a Pharmacogenetics Clinical Decision Support Tool Via Mobile Application.
In previous work, a prototype clinical decision support mobile application was created that accepts a patient's genomic profile information and provides information and rationale for the prescription of certain oncology medications. The response to the instrument was overwhelmingly positive by healthcare providers in the oncology field who tested the instrument. This article reports on the interdisciplinary collaboration among nursing and computer science to redesign and reimplement a new version of the instrument with expanded functionality and improved usability. This article describes the functionality, usability considerations, and usability evaluation of the instrument over three versions. The current version is Web-based and responsive to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile), features improved usability, and expands the number of gene-drug recommendations provided based on Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium dosing guidelines. This project represents a successful new collaboration between the nursing and computer science disciplines.
