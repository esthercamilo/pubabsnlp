Virtual twin for healthcare management.
Healthcare is increasingly fragmented, resulting in escalating costs, patient dissatisfaction, and sometimes adverse clinical outcomes. Strategies to decrease healthcare fragmentation are therefore attractive from payer and patient perspectives. In this commentary, a patient-centered smart phone application called Virtual Twin for Healthcare Management (VTHM) is proposed, including its organizational layout, basic functionality, and potential clinical applications. The platform features a virtual twin hub that displays the body and its health data. This is a physiologically based human model that is "virtualized" for the patient based on their unique genetic, molecular, physiological, and disease characteristics. The spokes of the system are a full service and interoperable electronic-health record, accessible to healthcare providers with permission on any device with internet access. Theoretical case studies based on real scenarios are presented to show how VTHM could potentially improve patient care and clinical efficiency. Challenges that must be overcome to turn VTHM into reality are also briefly outlined. Notably, the VTHM platform is designed to operationalize current and future precision medicine initiatives, such as access to molecular diagnostic results, pharmacogenomics-guided prescribing, and model-informed precision dosing.
