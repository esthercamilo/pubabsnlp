[Pharmacogenomics - a cornerstone of Precision Medicine. Genomic Medicine Sweden analyses genotypes associated with serious drug toxicity or therapeutic failure].
Serious adverse drug reactions, drug intolerance, and lack of effect are major problems in healthcare. Pharmacogenomics is the part of precision medicine that aims to develop predictive risk markers in this respect and establish such testing in clinical practice. The nation-wide project Genomic Medicine Sweden (GMS) is undertaking large-scale sequencing to predict risk of drug toxicity and lack of efficacy in malignant diseases. The aim is to facilitate an improved, individualized treatment with increased patient safety. In addition to accurate genotyping, other technical or infrastructure-related aspects need to be considered for a successful implementation in healthcare, for example electronic accessibility and visibility of pharmacogenomic data of long-standing relevance for an individual's ongoing and future drug treatment.
