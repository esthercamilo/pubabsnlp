Profiling of pharmacogenomic variants in <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>DPYD</i> in indigenous Arab breast cancer patients.
<b>Aim:</b> The indigenous Arab population is underrepresented in genomic studies and the landscape of actionable pharmacogenomic variants among Arab breast cancer patients remains unclear. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Exome sequencing was performed on 220 unselected Arab female breast cancer patients and germline variants in <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>DPYD</i> were profiled using a deep learning method. <b>Results:</b> In total, 13 (5.9%) patients had clinically actionable results and 56 (25.5%) carried an allele in <i>DYPD</i> or <i>CYP2D6</i> with unknown impact on drug metabolism. In addition, four unique novel missense variants were discovered, including one inÂ <i>CYP2D6</i> (p.Arg64Leu) with high predicted pathogenicity. <b>Conclusion:</b> A nontrivial subset of Arab breast cancer patients can potentially benefit from pretreatment molecular profiling, and further study is needed to improve characterization of the pharmacogenomic landscape.
