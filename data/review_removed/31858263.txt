Defining screening panel of functional variants of CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 genes in Serbian population.
Plethora of drugs and toxic substances is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450). These enzymes are coded by highly variable genes abundant with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) that affect the functionality of the enzymes, increasing or decreasing their activity. CYP genes genotyping, followed by haplotype inference, provides substrate specific metabolic phenotype prediction. This is crucial in pharmacogenetics and applicable in molecular autopsy. However, high number of alleles in CYP450 superfamily and interethnic variability in frequency distribution require precise gene panel customization. To estimate informativeness of SNVs and alleles in CYP gene families 1, 2, and 3, associated with metabolic alterations, 500 unrelated individuals from 5 regions of Serbia were genotyped using TaqMan assays to determine frequencies of CYP2C9 *2 and *3, CYP2C19 *2 and *17 alleles, four variants in CYP2D6 (rs3892097, rs1065852, rs28371725, rs28371706) gene, and CYP3A4*1B allele. In addition, CYP1A1 rs4646903 and rs1048943 (m1 and m2) variants were genotyped by RFLP. Our results showed that frequencies of tested variants in Serbian population corresponded to general European population and somewhat differed from neighboring populations. SNV rs1065852, the main contributor to non-functional CYP2D6 *4, significantly departed from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. With the exception of rs28371706 in CYP2D6 and rs2740574 in CYP3A4, which were very rare in our sample, all other tested variants in CYP2 family are informative and appropriate for pharmacogenetic testing, molecular autopsy, and medico-legal genetic analyses.
