An Ayurgenomics Approach: Prakriti-Based Drug Discovery and Development for Personalized Care.
Originating in ancient India, Ayurveda is an alternative medicinal approach that provides substantial evidence for a theoretical-level analysis of all aspects of life. Unlike modern medicine, Ayurveda is based upon tridoshas (<i>Vata, pitta, and Kapha</i>) and <i>Prakriti.</i> On the other hand, the research of all the genes involved at the proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptome levels are referred to as <i>genomics</i>. Geoclimatic regions (deshanupatini), familial characteristics (kulanupatini), and ethnicity (jatiprasakta) have all been shown to affect phenotypic variability. The combination of genomics with Ayurveda known as ayurgenomics provided new insights into tridosha that may pave the way for precision medicine (personalized medicine). Through successful coordination of "omics," <i>Prakriti</i>-based treatments can help change the existing situation in health care. <i>Prakriti</i> refers to an individual's behavioral trait, which is established at the moment of birth and cannot be fully altered during one's existence. Ayurvedic methodologies are based on three <i>Prakriti</i> aspects: <i>aushadhi</i> (medication), <i>vihara</i> (lifestyle), and <i>ahara</i> (diet). A foundation of <i>Prakriti</i>-based medicine, preventative medicine, and improvement of life quality with longevity can be accomplished through these ayurvedic characteristics. In this perspective, we try to understand prakriti's use in personalized medicine, and how to integrate it with programs for drug development and discovery.
