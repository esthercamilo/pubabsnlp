PharmVar GeneFocus: CYP2B6.
The Pharmacogene Variation Consortium (PharmVar) catalogs star (*) allele nomenclature for the polymorphic human CYP2B6 gene. Genetic variation within the CYP2B6 gene locus impacts the metabolism or bioactivation of clinically important drugs. Of particular importance are efficacy and safety concerns regarding: efavirenz, which is used for the treatment of HIV type-1 infection; methadone, a mainstay in the treatment of opioid use disorder and as an analgesic; ketamine, used as an antidepressant and analgesic; and bupropion, which is prescribed to treat depression and for smoking cessation. This GeneFocus provides a comprehensive overview and summary of CYP2B6 and describes how haplotype information catalogued by PharmVar is utilized by the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC).
