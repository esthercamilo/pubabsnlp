[The prospects for the creation of the National Center for Personalized Medicine of Endocrine Diseases].
The National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology (NMRCE) received the right to implement the development program of the World-class Research Centre "The National Center for personalized medicine of endocrine diseases" (NMCPMED). The objective of the NMCPMED will be not only the creation of a system of personalized treatment, but also the training of new specialists for medicine.  Fundamental researches, carried out on the basis of the already existing institutes and laboratories of the NMRCE will be expanded by creating new laboratories of the NCPMED created de novo in accordance with the approved project. This article introduces the reader to the most important laboratories that would be created in NCPMED. These are laboratories of general, molecular and population genetics, bioinformatics, pharmacogenomics, microbiota, genome editing, mathematical and digital technologies, non-invasive technologies for the diagnosis of endocrinopathies, cellular technologies, artificial intelligence and a fundamentally new laboratory of metabolic visualization and radioteranostics. The authors hope that readers of one of the main journals for endocrinologists in our country will actively participate in the  implementation of NMRCE, as both young and experienced talented researchers will have a chance to be a part of the Centre. To realize the ambitious implementation plans for the achievements of the Centre, it is necessary to radically change the worldview of the doctors in our country, to train them in a new way, and to expand the structure of the Center's team by increasing the number of specialists in medical genetics, transcriptomics, biostatistics and bioinformatics, working at the intersection of experimental and clinical endocrinology, and ensuring the transit of innovative technologies into clinical practice. New laboratories of the World-Class Research Center, will become the place of routine work of a new generation of doctors, who possess not only the basics of clinical work, but also the skills of fundamental researches that will allow them to significantly improve the methods of diagnosis and treatment.
