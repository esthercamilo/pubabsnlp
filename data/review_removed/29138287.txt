Clopidogrel Carboxylic Acid Glucuronidation is Mediated Mainly by UGT2B7, UGT2B4, and UGT2B17: Implications for Pharmacogenetics and Drug-Drug Interactions<sup> </sup>.
The antiplatelet drug clopidogrel is metabolized to an acyl-<i>β</i>-d-glucuronide, which causes time-dependent inactivation of CYP2C8. Our aim was to characterize the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes that are responsible for the formation of clopidogrel acyl-<i>β</i>-d-glucuronide. Kinetic analyses and targeted inhibition experiments were performed using pooled human liver and intestine microsomes (HLMs and HIMs, respectively) and selected human recombinant UGTs based on preliminary screening. The effects of relevant <i>UGT</i> polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel were evaluated in 106 healthy volunteers. UGT2B7 and UGT2B17 exhibited the greatest level of clopidogrel carboxylic acid glucuronidation activities, with a CL<sub>int,u</sub> of 2.42 and 2.82 <i>µ</i>l⋅min<sup>-1</sup>⋅mg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Of other enzymes displaying activity (UGT1A3, UGT1A9, UGT1A10-H, and UGT2B4), UGT2B4 (CL<sub>int,u</sub> 0.51 <i>µ</i>l⋅min<sup>-1</sup>⋅mg<sup>-1</sup>) was estimated to contribute significantly to the hepatic clearance. Nonselective UGT2B inhibitors strongly inhibited clopidogrel acyl-<i>β</i>-d-glucuronide formation in HLMs and HIMs. The UGT2B17 inhibitor imatinib and the UGT2B7 and UGT1A9 inhibitor mefenamic acid inhibited clopidogrel carboxylic acid glucuronidation in HIMs and HLMs, respectively. Incubation of clopidogrel carboxylic acid in HLMs with UDPGA and NADPH resulted in strong inhibition of CYP2C8 activity. In healthy volunteers, the <i>UGT2B17*2</i> deletion allele was associated with a 10% decrease per copy in the plasma clopidogrel acyl-<i>β</i>-d-glucuronide to clopidogrel carboxylic acid area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 hours (AUC<sub>0-4</sub>) ratio (<i>P</i> < 0.05). To conclude, clopidogrel carboxylic acid is metabolized mainly by UGT2B7 and UGT2B4 in the liver and by UGT2B17 in the small intestinal wall. The formation of clopidogrel acyl-<i>β</i>-d-glucuronide is impaired in carriers of the <i>UGT2B17</i> deletion. These findings may have implications regarding the intracellular mechanisms leading to CYP2C8 inactivation by clopidogrel.
