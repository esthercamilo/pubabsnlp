Genetic variations in the ADCK1 gene predict paliperidone palmitate efficacy in Han Chinese patients with schizophrenia.
Genome-wide association study results have linked ADCK1 genetic variation with paliperidone efficacy in a European cohort. However, the generalizability of this locus to non-European populations is unknown. Han Chinese schizophrenia patients (n = 159) were treated with paliperidone palmitate and symptom severity was assessed over 3 months. Examination of 13 ADCK1 genetic variants revealed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs12590199, rs11159291) and one haplotype (rs2364747-rs12590199) associated with paliperidone palmitate response. Future work into ADCK1's function and its potential interaction with paliperidone is warranted.
