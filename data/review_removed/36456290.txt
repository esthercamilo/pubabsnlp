Integrating pharmacogenomics into clinical trials of hearing disorders.
In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued guidance to increase the efficiency of drug development and support precision medicine, including tailoring treatments to those patients who will benefit based on genetic variation even in the absence of a documented mechanism of action. Although multiple advancements have been made in the field of pharmacogenetics (PGx) for other disease conditions, there are no approved PGx guidelines in the treatment of hearing disorders. In studies of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), some progress has been made in the last several years associating genomic loci with susceptibility to noise damage. However, the power of such studies is limited as the underlying physiological responses may vary considerably among the patient populations. Here, we have summarized previous animal studies to argue that NIHL subtyping is a promising strategy to increase the granularity of audiological assessments. By coupling this enhanced phenotyping capability with genetic association studies, we suggest that drug efficacy will be better predicted, increasing the likelihood of success in clinical trials when populations are stratified based on genetic variation or designed with multidrug combinations to reach a broader segment of individuals suffering or at risk from NIHL.
