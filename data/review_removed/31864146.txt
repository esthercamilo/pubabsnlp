A single-center, retrospective analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations in children with Dravet syndrome.
Dravet syndrome is an early-onset epileptic encephalopathy caused most often by loss-of-function SCN1A variants. Following recognition of its genetic basis and unique clinical features, Dravet syndrome has become one of the most well-studied genetic epilepsies. We sought to evaluate the genetic diversity and correlative seizure phenotype, comorbidities, and response to antiepileptic therapies of patients with clinically-diagnosed Dravet syndrome seen in a tertiary care center. The goal of this study was to examine genotype-phenotype correlations and to ascertain if specific antiepileptic therapies may be more effective on the basis of genetic test result alone.
