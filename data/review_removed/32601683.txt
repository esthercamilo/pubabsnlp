Pharmacogenomics meets precision cardio-oncology: is there synergistic potential?
An individual's inherited genetic makeup and acquired genomic variants may account for a significant portion of observable variability in therapy efficacy and toxicity. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is the concept that treatments can be modified to account for these differences to increase chances of therapeutic efficacy while minimizing risk of adverse effects. This is particularly applicable to oncology in which treatment may be multimodal. Each tumor type has a unique genomic signature that lends to inclusion of targeted therapy but may be associated with cumulative toxicity, such as cardiotoxicity, and can impact quality of life. A greater understanding of therapeutic agents impacted by PGx and subsequent implementation has the potential to improve outcomes and reduce risk of drug-induced adverse effects.
