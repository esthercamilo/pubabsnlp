Warfarin pharmacogenetics in a black Zimbabwean cohort: an observational prospective study.
<b>Aim:</b> A prospective observational study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of implementing clinical guidelines for warfarin dosing in black Zimbabwean patients. <b>Methods:</b> <i>CYP2C9*5</i>, <i>CYP2C9*6</i>, <i>CYP2C9*8</i> and <i>CYP2C9*11</i> and <i>VKORC1</i> c. 1639 G>A variations were observed in 62 study patients. <b>Results & Conclusion:</b> Overall, 39/62 (62.90%) participants did not receive a warfarin starting dose as would have been recommended by Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines. US FDA and Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group guidelines are based on <i>CYP2C9*2</i> and <i>CYP2C9*3</i> only, hence, unlikely useful in this cohort, where such variants were not detected. Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines, on the other hand, have a specific recommendation on the African-specific variants <i>CYP2C9*5</i>, <i>CYP2C9*6</i> and <i>CYP2C9*11</i>, and are hence suitable for implementation in Zimbabwe and would help optimize warfarin doses in patients in the study cohort.
