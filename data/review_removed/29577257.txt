Pharmacogenetics of vitamin K antagonists and bleeding risk prediction in atrial fibrillation.
Polymorphisms in the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1) and cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) genes increase the bleeding risk in anticoagulated atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Here, we aimed to investigate whether VKORC1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms improved the predictive performance for major bleeding using the HAS-BLED score.
