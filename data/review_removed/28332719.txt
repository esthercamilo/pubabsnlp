rs7968606 polymorphism of ANKS1B is associated with improvement in the PANSS general score of schizophrenia caused by amisulpride.
A recent genome-wide pharmacogenomics study showed that the rs7968606 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 1B (ANKS1B) gene approached the threshold of statistical significance. The aim of this study was to determine the association between the rs7968606 SNP of ANKS1B and the treatment response to amisulpride in schizophrenia patients. In total, 154 participants were enrolled from six university hospitals in Korea. All the subjects were interviewed before and after 6 weeks of amisulpride treatment with the aid of the positive and negative syndrome scale and the clinical global impression-severity scale. Genotyping for the rs7968606 SNP of ANKS1B was performed in 101 subjects. Both the decrease (t = -2.067, p = 0.041) and improvement rate (t = -1.990, p = 0.049) in the positive and negative syndrome scale general score differed significantly between T-allele carriers and noncarriers of this polymorphism after 6 weeks of amisulpride treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first genetic association study of the relationship between the rs7968606 SNP of ANKS1B and the response of schizophrenia patients to treatment with amisulpride. Future larger-scale studies involving more SNPs of ANKS1B will improve the understanding of the pharmacogenetics underlying the treatment responses to amisulpride.
