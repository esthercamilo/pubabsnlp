Heart Failure in the Era of Precision Medicine: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.
One of 5 people will develop heart failure over his or her lifetime. Early diagnosis and better understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease are critical to optimal treatment. The "omics"-genomics, pharmacogenomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics- of heart failure represent rapidly expanding fields of science that have, to date, not been integrated into a single body of work. The goals of this statement are to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of these omics as they relate to the development and progression of heart failure and to consider the current and potential future applications of these data for precision medicine with respect to prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.
