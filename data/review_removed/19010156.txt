Clinical relevance and prevalence of polymorphisms in CYP3A5 and MDR1 genes that encode tacrolimus biotransformation enzymes in liver transplant recipients.
To study the prevalence and clinical significance of polymorphisms in the CYP3A5 and MDR1 genes in liver transplant patients and their donors; to determine the relative importance of genes from the donor and the recipient; to assess the relationship of polymorphisms with the variability of concentration/dose of tacrolimus for optimization and individualization regimens.
