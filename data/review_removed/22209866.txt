Pharmacogenomic analysis of ATP-sensitive potassium channels coexpressing the common type 2 diabetes risk variants E23K and S1369A.
The common ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel variants E23K and S1369A, found in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, respectively, form a haplotype that is associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Our previous studies showed that KATP channel inhibition by the A-site sulfonylurea gliclazide was increased in the K23/A1369 haplotype. Therefore, we studied the pharmacogenomics of seven clinically used sulfonylureas and glinides to determine their structure-activity relationships in KATP channels containing either the E23/S1369 nonrisk or K23/A1369 risk haplotypes.
