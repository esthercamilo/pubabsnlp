The effect of <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP2C9</i> gene polymorphisms on the efficacy and safety of the combination of tramadol and ketorolac used for postoperative pain management in patients after video laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
One of the key components of ERAS is adequate pain control in the postoperative period. There are no rational schemes for postoperative pain relief. At the same time, adequate postoperative pain relief promotes early activation and early rehabilitation of patients and shortens the duration of the postoperative stay, and does not cause postoperative complications associated with analgesia (weakness, intestinal paresis, nausea and vomiting). The aims of the present study are to assess the possible association of <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP2C9</i> polymorphisms with the efficacy and safety of tramadol and ketorolac in postoperative pain.
