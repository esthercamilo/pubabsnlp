Predictive Value of <i>SLCO1B1</i> c.521T>C Polymorphism on Observed Changes in the Treatment of 1136 Statin-Users.
Pharmacogenomic testing is a method to prevent adverse drug reactions. Pharmacogenomics could be relevant to optimize statin treatment, by identifying patients at high risk for adverse drug reactions. We aim to investigate the clinical validity and utility of pre-emptive pharmacogenomics screening in primary care, with <i>SLCO1B1</i> c.521T>C as a risk factor for statin-induced adverse drug reactions. The focus was on changes in therapy as a proxy for adverse drug reactions observed in statin-users in a population-based Dutch cohort. In total, 1136 statin users were retrospectively genotyped for the <i>SLCO1B1</i> c.521T>C polymorphism (rs4149056) and information on their statin dispensing was evaluated as cross-sectional research. Approximately half of the included participants discontinued or switched their statin treatment within three years. In our analyses, we could not confirm an association between the <i>SLCO1B1</i> c.521T>C genotype and any change in statin therapy or arriving at a stable dose sooner in primary care. To be able to evaluate the predictive values of <i>SLCO1B1</i> c.521T>C genotype on adverse drug reactions from statins, prospective data collection of actual adverse drug reactions and reasons to change statin treatment should be facilitated.
