Present and future of drug therapy in hypertension: an overview.
<b>Purpose:</b> High blood pressure (HBP) is the leading cause of mortality and years of disability, and its prevalence is increasing. Therefore, diagnosis and effective treatment of HBP is one of the main goals to prevent and reduce its complications, and pharmacological treatment is the cornerstone of hypertension management.<b>Materials and Methods:</b> The gradual introduction of different drug families has led to the development of new molecules that have improved efficacy and reduced adverse effects. <b>Results:</b> Current drugs include a large number that target key mechanisms of blood pressure regulation as well as those that contribute to hypertension-induced organ damage. Recently, new antihypertensive drugs have been introduced that not only aim to lower blood pressure but also provide additional protection against organ damage and metabolic disorders. Some of them were introduced for specific indications other than hypertension and other are based in a pharmacogenomic approach. Other routes of administration, such subcutaneous injection, are also being explored to improve protection and compliance.<b>Conclusions:</b> The main characteristics of each class of antihypertensive drug are summarised.
