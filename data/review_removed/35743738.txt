Pharmacogenomic Profile of Amazonian Amerindians.
Given the role of pharmacogenomics in the large variability observed in drug efficacy/safety, an assessment about the pharmacogenomic profile of patients prior to drug prescription or dose adjustment is paramount to improve adherence to treatment and prevent adverse drug reaction events. A population commonly underrepresented in pharmacogenomic studies is the Native American populations, which have a unique genetic profile due to a long process of geographic isolation and other genetic and evolutionary processes. Here, we describe the pharmacogenetic variability of Native American populations regarding 160 pharmacogenes involved in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes and biological pathways of different therapies. Data were obtained through complete exome sequencing of individuals from 12 different Amerindian groups of the Brazilian Amazon. The study reports a total of 3311 variants; of this, 167 are exclusive to Amerindian populations, and 1183 are located in coding regions. Among these new variants, we found non-synonymous coding variants in the <i>DPYD</i> and the <i>IFNL4</i> genes and variants with high allelic frequencies in intronic regions of the <i>MTHFR, TYMS, GSTT1</i>, and <i>CYP2D6</i> genes. Additionally, 332 variants with either high or moderate (disruptive or non-disruptive impact in protein effectiveness, respectively) significance were found with a minimum of 1% frequency in the Amazonian Amerindian population. The data reported here serve as scientific basis for future design of specific treatment protocols for Amazonian Amerindian populations as well as for populations admixed with them, such as the Northern Brazilian population.
