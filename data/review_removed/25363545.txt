Cytochrome P450 single nucleotide polymorphisms in an indigenous Tanzanian population: a concern about the metabolism of artemisinin-based combinations.
Artemisinin-based combinations currently recommended for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in many countries of sub-Saharan Africa are substrates of CYP enzymes. The cytochrome enzyme system is responsible for metabolism of about 80-90% of clinically used drugs. It is, therefore, important to obtain the pharmacogenetics of the population in the region with respect to these combinations and thereby enable practitioners to predict treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to detect and determine allelic frequencies of CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3, CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3 and CYP2B6*6 variant alleles in a Tanzanian indigenous population.
