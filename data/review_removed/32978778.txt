PharmGKB Tutorial for Pharmacogenomics of Drugs Potentially Used in the Context of COVID-19.
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is a key area of precision medicine, which is already being implemented in some health systems and may help guide clinicians toward effective therapies for individual patients. Over the last 2Â decades, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) has built a unique repository of PGx knowledge, including annotations of clinical guideline and regulator-approved drug labels in addition to evidence-based drug pathways and annotations of the scientific literature. All of this knowledge is freely accessible on the PharmGKB website. In the first of a series of PharmGKB tutorials, we introduce the PharmGKB coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) portal and, using examples of drugs found in the portal, demonstrate some of the main features of PharmGKB. This paper is intended as a resource to help users become quickly acquainted with the wealth of information stored in PharmGKB.
