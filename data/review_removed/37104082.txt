An Integrated Multidisciplinary Circuit Led by Hospital and Community Pharmacists to Implement Clopidogrel Pharmacogenetics in Clinical Practice.
The use of pharmacogenetics to optimize pharmacotherapy is growing rapidly. This study evaluates the feasibility and operability of a collaborative circuit involving hospital and community pharmacists to implement clopidogrel pharmacogenetics in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. We aimed to enroll patients with a clopidogrel prescription from cardiologists at the collaborating hospital. Community pharmacists collected patients' pharmacotherapeutic profiles and saliva samples, which were then sent to the hospital for <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping. Hospital pharmacists collated the obtained data with patients' clinical records. Data were analyzed jointly with a cardiologist to assess the suitability of clopidogrel. The provincial pharmacists' association coordinated the project and provided IT and logistic support. The study began in January 2020. However, it was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At that moment, 120 patients had been assessed, 16 of whom met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. The processing of samples obtained before the pandemic had an average delay of 13.8 ± 5.4 days. A total of 37.5% patients were intermediate metabolizers and 18.8% were ultrarapid metabolizers. No poor metabolizers were detected. Pharmacists rated their experience with a 7.3 ± 2.7 likelihood of recommending that fellow pharmacists participate. The net promoter score among participating pharmacists was +10%. Our results show that the circuit is feasible and operable for further initiatives.
