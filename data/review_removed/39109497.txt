Implementing pharmacogenomic testing in Australian general practice: an exploratory qualitative study.
<b>Aim:</b> To explore general practitioners' (GPs) views on implementing pharmacogenomic testing in Australian general practice. <b>Methods:</b> Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine GPs in Australia, recruited from primary care networks. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes were mapped onto the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research domains. <b>Results:</b> Barriers to implementation included lack of knowledge, education, standardized pharmacogenomic reports and national clinical guidelines and financial inaccessibility. Facilitators included positive exposure to pharmacogenomics, peer influences, interdisciplinary collaboration and proven clinical utility. Current uptake was minimal; however, GPs shared positive perceptions of clinical use. <b>Conclusion:</b> Recommendations for successful implementation include building and disseminating clinical evidence, developing national guidelines and standardized reports, incorporation into formal education and increasing financial accessibility.
