Cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis by cajanin stilbene acid from Cajanus cajan in breast cancer cells.
The low abundant cajanin stilbene acid (CSA) from Pigeon Pea (Cajanus cajan) has been shown to kill estrogen receptor Î± positive cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Downstream effects such as cell cycle and apoptosis-related mechanisms have not been analyzed yet.
