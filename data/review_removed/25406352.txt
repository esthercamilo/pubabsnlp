The intron-22-inverted F8 locus permits factor VIII synthesis: explanation for low inhibitor risk and a role for pharmacogenomics.
Intron-22-inversion patients express the entire Factor VIII (FVIII)-amino-acid sequence intracellularly as 2 non-secreted polypeptides and have a positive "intracellular (I)-FVIII-CRM" status. Mutations conferring a positive I-FVIII-CRM status are associated with low inhibitor risk and are pharmacogenetically relevant because inhibitor risk may be affected by the nature of the therapeutic FVIII-protein (tFVIII), the affinity of any tFVIII-derived foreign peptide (tFVIII-fp) for any HLA class-II isomer (HLA-II) comprising individual major histocompatibility complex (MHC) repertoires, and the stability of any tFVIII-fp/HLA-II complex. We hypothesize that mutations conferring a completely or substantially negative I-FVIII-CRM status are pharmacogenetically irrelevant because inhibitor risk is high with any tFVIII and individual MHC repertoire.
