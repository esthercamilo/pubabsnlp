Warfarin pharmacogenetics: a controlled dose-response study in healthy subjects.
The aim of this study was to determine how genetic variants contribute to warfarin dosing variability when non-genetic factors are controlled. Thirty healthy subjects were subjected to a warfarin dosing algorithm with daily international normalized ratio (INR) measurements to INR ≥ 2.0, then off warfarin to INR ≤ 1.2. The primary outcome was the cumulative dose required to achieve INR ≥ 2.0 for 2 consecutive days. CYP2C9 (p=0.004) and VKORC1 (p=0.02) variant carriers required lower cumulative doses, and CYP4F2 carriers required higher doses (p=0.04). Subjects with variants in both CYP2C9 and VKORC1 required fewer days to reach INR ≥ 2.0 than wild-type subjects or those with variants in CYP2C9 or VKORC1 (p=0.01). Genetic contribution to dose variability (~62%) was greater than previously reported, suggesting that uncontrolled clinical variables influence the effect of these variants. In conclusion, genotype-guided warfarin-dosing algorithms may rely more on genetic variables in healthier individuals than in patients with clinical confounders.
