Pharmacogenetics in primary care.
The use of pharmacogenetic information is becoming mainstream with insurance companies and others starting to pay for widescale implementation of this new technology starting with patients who have anxiety and depression. It has been introduced in response to the unpredictability of medication, the high number of adverse drug events, and lack of drug effectiveness. Greater than one-third of patients are identified as having one or more pharmacogenetic variants. Each pharmacogenetic variant may affect the metabolism of several medications used in primary care, in addition to the antidepressant and anti-anxiolytic medications. Pharmacogenetic information is evolving with major international working groups providing continuous updates. It is challenging to incorporate this new information along with all the other variables needed to identify safe and effective drug options within a normal consultation. Medication decision support software is one solution that can help address this.
