Relationship between the serotonin transporter polymorphism and obsessive-compulsive alcohol craving in alcohol-dependent adults: a pilot study.
A serotonin deficiency state has been implicated in alcohol-dependent individuals' experience of obsessive-compulsive alcohol craving. Because the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) functions to remove serotonin from the synapse, it is thought that increased reuptake (indicated by the number of high-expressing L(A) alleles present in the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region [5-HTTLPR] of the SLC6A4 gene) is associated with an increase in obsessive-compulsive alcohol craving. The current pilot investigation sought to explore this hypothesis by examining the extent to which obsessive-compulsive alcohol craving varies by 5-HTTLPR genotype among participants enrolled in an ongoing pharmacogenetics trial. All participants were screened with a semi-structured diagnostic interview, completed self-report measures of alcohol-related behavior, and underwent peripheral venous blood draw for DNA genotyping. Cross-sectional data obtained at baseline from 176 currently drinking alcohol-dependent individuals were analyzed using multiple regression. Preliminary findings suggest that 5-HTTLPR is not predictive of Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale total and factor scores. Although the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was not related to obsessive-compulsive alcohol craving in this pilot study, additional research is needed to clarify the possible role of serotonergic mechanisms in alcohol craving.
