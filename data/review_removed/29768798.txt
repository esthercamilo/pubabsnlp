Challenges and opportunities in implementing pharmacogenomics testing in the clinics.
The field of pharmacogenomics aims to incorporate individual patient genomic information into treatment selection. This is a rapidly evolving field with significant clinical promise. Implementation into clinical practice has several challenges that must be overcome. Genomics-based information encompasses large databases and requires expert knowledge for interpretation. Existing research suggests there are already several areas where pharmacogenomics-based decision-making is ripe for adoption into clinical practice. Impediments exist that must be overcome prior to large-scale implementation of existing pharmacogenomics-based therapies. There are several institutions and corporations at the forefront of implementation that are leading the development; however, larger systems-based approaches will be necessary. This article will discuss some of the present successes and future challenges that are necessary to overcome in order to implement a more patient-centered healthcare system.
