Very important pharmacogenetic variants landscape and potential clinical relevance in the Zhuang population from Yunnan province.
The gradual evolution of pharmacogenomics has shed light on the genetic basis for inter-individual drug response variations across diverse populations. This study aimed to identify pharmacogenomic variants that differ in Zhuang population compared with other populations and investigate their potential clinical relevance in gene-drug and genotypic-phenotypic associations. A total of 48 variants from 24 genes were genotyped in 200 Zhuang subjects using the Agena MassARRAY platform. The allele frequencies and genotype distribution data of 26 populations were obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project, followed by a comparison and statistical analysis. After Bonferroni correction, significant differences in genotype frequencies were observed of CYP3A5 (rs776746), ACE (rs4291), KCNH2 (rs1805123), and CYP2D6 (rs1065852) between the Zhuang population and the other 26 populations. It was also found that the Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna, China, Han Chinese in Beijing, China, and Southern Han Chinese, China showed least deviation from the Zhuang population. The Esan in Nigeria, Gambian in Western Division, The Gambia, and Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria exhibited the largest differences. This was also proved by structural analysis, Fst analysis and phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, these differential variants may be associated with the pharmacological efficacy and toxicity of Captopril, Amlodipine, Lisinopril, metoclopramide, and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol in the Zhuang population. Our study has filled the gap of pharmacogenomic information in the Zhuang population and has provided a theoretical framework for the secure administration of drugs in the Zhuang population.
