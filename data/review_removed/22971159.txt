Analysis of cytochrome P450 gene polymorphism in a lupus nephritis patient in whom tacrolimus blood concentration was markedly elevated after administration of azole antifungal agents.
Both itraconazole (ITCZ) and voriconazole (VCZ) are potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, and their effects have been reported to be equal. However, ITCZ is metabolized by CYP3A, whereas VCZ is mainly metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and only partially by CYP3A. We experienced the case of a patient who showed a 5-fold increase in trough levels of tacrolimus (FK) level after switching from ITCZ to VCZ. Our objective is to discuss the mechanism of the increase drug-drug interaction in terms of serum concentration of the azole drugs and patient pharmacogenomics.
