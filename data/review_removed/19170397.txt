Pharmacogenomic strategy for individualizing antidepressant therapy.
Despite remarkable progress, pharmacotherapy in general, including that for the treatment of depressive conditions, has often ignored the magnitude and clinical significance of the huge interindividual variations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, resulting in poor compliance, suboptimal therapeutic effects, and treatment resistance. Advances in pharmacogenomics and computer modeling technologies hold promise for achieving the goals of "individualized" ("personalized") medicine. However, the challenges for realizing such goals remain substantial. These include the packaging and interpretation of genotyping results, changes in medical practice (innovation diffusion), and infrastructural, financing, ethical, and organizational issues related to the use of new information.
