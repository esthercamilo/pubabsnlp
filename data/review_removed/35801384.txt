Analysis of pharmacogenomic very important pharmacogenomic variants: <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>ACE</i>, <i>PTGS2</i> and <i>NAT2</i> genes in Chinese Bai population.
<b>Aim:</b> Our study aimed to screen the genotype frequencies of very important pharmacogenomic (VIP) mutations and identify their differences between Bai and other populations. <b>Materials & methods:</b> We selected 66 VIP variants from PharmGKB (www.pharmgkb.org/) for genotyping. χ2 test was used to identify differences in <i>loci</i> between these populations and FST values of Bai and the other 26 populations were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Our study showed that the frequencies of SNPs of <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>ACE</i>, <i>PTGS2</i> and <i>NAT2</i> differed significantly from those of the other 26 populations. At the same time, we found that some VIP variants may affect the metabolism of drugs and the genetic relationship between the Bai population and East Asian populations was found to be the closest. <b>Conclusion:</b> By comparing the genotype frequencies of different populations, the <i>loci</i> with significant differences were identified and discussed, providing a theoretical basis for individualized drug use in the Bai ethnic population.
