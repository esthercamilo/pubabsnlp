Multi-Gene Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Detection in Gastric Cancer Based on Ion Semiconductor Sequencing Platform.
Gastric cancer is a common heterogeneous tumor. Most patients have advanced gastric cancer at the time of diagnosis and often need chemotherapy. Although 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is widely used for treatment, its therapeutic sensitivity and drug tolerance still need to be determined, which emphasizes the importance of individualized administration. Pharmacogenetics can guide the clinical implementation of individualized treatment. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as a genetic marker, contribute to the selection of appropriate chemotherapy regimens and dosages. Some SNPs are associated with folate metabolism, the therapeutic target of 5-FU. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rs1801131 and rs1801133, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) rs1650697 and rs442767, methionine synthase (MTR) rs1805087, gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) rs11545078 and solute carrier family 19 member 1 (SLC19A1) rs1051298 have been investigated in different kinds of cancers and antifolate antitumor drugs, which have potential forecasting and guiding significance for application of 5-FU. The ion torrent next-generation semiconductor sequencing technology can rapidly detect gastric cancer-related SNPs. Each time a base is extended in a DNA chain, an H<sup>+</sup> will be released, causing local pH changes. The ionic sensor detects pH changes and converts chemical signals into digital signals, achieving sequencing by synthesis. This technique has low sample requirement, simple operation, low cost, and fast sequencing speed, which is beneficial for guiding individualized chemotherapy by SNPs.
