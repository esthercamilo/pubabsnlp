How has the brain disease model of addiction contributed to tobacco control?
Our paper evaluates the extent to which the brain disease model of addiction (BDMA) has contributed to reducing the prevalence of tobacco smoking and Â tobacco-related harm over the past 20 years. We discuss the ways in which genetic and neuroscience research on nicotine addiction have contributed to our understanding of tobacco smoking. We then examine the extent to which the BDMA has produced more effective treatments to assist smoking cessation. We also assess the degree to which the BDMA has contributed to the tobacco control policies that have produced substantial reductions in tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in the two decades since the model was first proposed by Alan Leshner. We also assess whether the BDMA has reduced the stigmatisation of people who smoke tobacco.
