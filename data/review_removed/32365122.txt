PG-path: Modeling and personalizing pharmacogenomics-based pathways.
A pharmacogenomics-based pathway represents a series of reactions that occur between drugs and genes in the human body after drug administration. PG-path is a pharmacogenomics-based pathway that standardizes and visualizes the components (nodes) and actions (edges) involved in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes. It provides an intuitive understanding of the drug response in the human body. A pharmacokinetic pathway visualizes the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) at the systemic level, and a pharmacodynamic pathway shows the action of the drug in the target cell at the cellular-molecular level. The genes in the pathway are displayed in locations similar to those inside the body. PG-path allows personalized pathways to be created by annotating each gene with the overall impact degree of deleterious variants in the gene. These personalized pathways play a role in assisting tailored individual prescriptions by predicting changes in the drug concentration in the plasma. PG-path also supports counseling for personalized drug therapy by providing visualization and documentation.
