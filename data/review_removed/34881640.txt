Prioritizing pharmacogenomics implementation initiates: a survey of healthcare professionals.
<b>Aim:</b> Characterize current perceptions, practices, preferences and barriers to integrating pharmacogenomics into patient care at an institution with an established pharmacogenomics clinic. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A 16-item anonymous survey was sent to healthcare professionals practicing at Tampa General Hospital and the University of South Florida Health. <b>Results:</b> Survey participants consisted of nine advanced practice providers, 41 pharmacists and 64 physicians. Majority of survey participants did not feel confident in their ability to interpret and apply pharmacogenomic results. In the past 12Â months, 27% of physicians reported ordering a pharmacogenomic test. The greatest reported barrier to integrating pharmacogenomics was the absence of established guidelines or protocols. <b>Conclusion:</b> Most clinicians believed pharmacogenomics would be useful in their clinical practice but do not feel prepared to interpret pharmacogenomic results.
