Chronic treatment of astrocytes with therapeutically relevant fluoxetine concentrations enhances cPLA2 expression secondary to 5-HT2B-induced, transactivation-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
We have recently shown that fluoxetine, a serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has low micromolar affinity for the 5-HT(2C) receptor (but not for 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2B) receptors) in primary cultures of mouse astrocytes. This was determined as phosphorylation (stimulation) of extracellular-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK(1/2)) by transactivation-mediated phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, followed by conventional EGF receptor signaling (Li et al., Psychopharmacology 194:333-334, 2007). Paroxetine has an identical effect. The present study shows that chronic fluoxetine treatment with even higher affinity (EC(50) = 0.5-2.0 microM) upregulates Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), which releases arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of membrane-bound phospholipid, without effect on secretory PLA(2) (sPLA(2)) and intracellular PLA(2) (iPLA(2)).
