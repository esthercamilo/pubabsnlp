Targeted panel sequencing of pharmacogenes and oncodrivers in colorectal cancer patients reveals genes with prognostic significance.
Colorectal cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and thus biomarkers allowing prediction of the resistance of patients to therapy and estimating their prognosis are needed. We designed a panel of 558 genes with pharmacogenomics records related to 5-fluorouracil resistance, genes important for sensitivity to other frequently used drugs, major oncodrivers, and actionable genes. We performed a target enrichment sequencing of DNA from tumors and matched blood samples of patients, and compared the results with patient prognosis stratified by systemic adjuvant chemotherapy.
