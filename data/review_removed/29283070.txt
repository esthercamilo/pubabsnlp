Pharmacogenomics of Methotrexate: Current Status and Future Outlook.
Methotrexate (MTX) is a folate analogue with high therapeutic efficiency in the treatment of cancers and autoimmune diseases. The efficacy and toxicity of MTX may be altered by genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in MTX metabolic pathway. Personalized pharmacotherapy based on gene polymorphisms enables a more efficient, compatible and cost-effective treatment of patients.
