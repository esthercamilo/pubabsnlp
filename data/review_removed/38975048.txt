The Diversity of <i>CYP2C19</i> Polymorphisms in the Thai Population: Implications for Precision Medicine.
<i>CYP2C19</i> plays a major role in the metabolism of various drugs. The most common genetic variants were the <i>CYP2C19*2</i> and <i>*3</i> alleles (<i>rs4244285</i> and <i>rs4986893</i>, non-functional variants). In previous studies, we found that genetic polymorphisms in <i>CYP2C19</i> variants influenced the active metabolites of clopidogrel and caused major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects. However, the distribution of <i>CYP2C19</i> varies among ethnic groups and according to adverse drug reactions. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of <i>CYP2C19</i> genetic polymorphisms in the Thai population and analyze the differences in the frequency of <i>CYP2C19</i> genetic polymorphisms between Thai and other populations.
