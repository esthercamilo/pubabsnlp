<i>CYP2D6</i> Genotype-Based Dose Recommendations for Risperidone in Asian People.
The aim of this study was to provide dose recommendations for risperidone in Asian people based on cytochrome P450 enzyme <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype. First, we investigated the influence of <i>CYP2D6</i> polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Then, we performed a search for studies covering the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters of risperidone and <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype. Pooled pharmacokinetic parameters were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model. Lastly, we calculated the dose adjustment for risperidone based on <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype for white and Asian people. Significant differences between the extensive metabolizer and intermediate metabolizer groups were observed for dose-adjusted risperidone level, 9-hydroxyrisperidone level, and risperidone/9-hydroxyrisperidone ratio, but not for the total active moiety. Meta-analysis showed that significant differences were observed among the four phenotype groups, including steady state concentration, peak risperidone concentration, and the area under the curve, using the Kruskal-Wallis test. No differences were found in oral clearance. For risperidone, dose recommendations for poor and ultrarapid metabolizers of <i>CYP2D6</i> for Asians were different compared to that for white people for poor metabolizers (dose adjustment around 45% for white people, while for Asians the risperidone dose should be reduced by 26%). For ultrarapid metabolizers, risperidone dose should be increased by about 33% for white people and 30% for Asians. This was a first attempt to apply pharmacogenetics to suggest dose-regimens for Asian people; further research to replicate and extend these findings is recommended.
