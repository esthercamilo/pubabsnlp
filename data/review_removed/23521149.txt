Pharmacogenetics of psoriasis: HLA-Cw6 but not LCE3B/3C deletion nor TNFAIP3 polymorphism predisposes to clinical response to interleukin 12/23 blocker ustekinumab.
Our understanding of the genetic basis of predisposition to psoriasis is increasing exponentially due to the progress of genetic studies. However, so far little is known about genetic predisposition in relation to the response to psoriasis treatments. Recent data identified genetic predictors for the clinical outcome of conventional treatments such as methotrexate, acitretin and vitamin D derivatives, but few studies are available on genetic predictors of response to biologics. We hypothesized that genetic variations associated with increased risk of developing psoriasis may also act as predictors for the outcome of biologic therapy.
