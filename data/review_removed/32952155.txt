Polymorphisms of stress pathway genes and emergence of suicidal ideation at antidepressant treatment onset.
The prescription of antidepressant drugs is one of the most frequently used strategies to prevent suicide and suicidal behavior. However, some patients develop suicidal ideation at antidepressant treatment onset, a phenomenon known as treatment-emergent suicidal ideation (TESI). Few studies have explored TESI pharmacogenomics. As the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis might be implicated in suicidal behavior, we assessed the relationship between TESI and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HPA axis-implicated NR3C1 (n = 7 SNPs), FKBP5 (n = 5 SNPs), AVPR1B (n = 1 SNPs), CRHR1 (n = 1 SNPs), and SKA2 (n = 1 SNPs) genes, in a sample of 3566 adult outpatients with depression for whom an antidepressant treatment was introduced. General practitioners and psychiatrists throughout France followed participants for 6 weeks after the initial prescription of tianeptine, an antidepressant molecule showing mu agonism. Suicidal ideation was assessed with item 10 of the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (item dedicated to suicidal ideation) at baseline, and at week 2, 4, and 6 of treatment. Within the informative sample, 112 patients reported TESI and 384 did not. TESI was significantly associated with the TT genotype of the SNP rs6902321 in FKBP5 (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = [1.07; 2.90]; p-value = 0.03) and the GG/AG genotype of the SNP rs7208505 in SKA2 (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = [1.03;3.33]; p-value = 0.04). These associations were not significant after multiple test correction. Nevertheless, our results suggest a possible involvement of HPA axis elements in treatment-emergent suicidal ideation (TESI).
