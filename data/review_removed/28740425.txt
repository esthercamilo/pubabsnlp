Efficacy of piroxicam for postoperative pain after lower third molar surgery associated with <i>CYP2C8*3</i> and <i>CYP2C9</i>.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), predominantly CYP2C8 and CYP2C9. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association of polymorphisms in the <i>CYP2C8*3</i> and <i>CYP2C9</i> genes with the clinical efficacy of oral piroxicam (20 mg daily for 4 days) after lower third molar surgeries with regard to postoperative pain, swelling, trismus, adverse reactions, need for rescue medication and the volunteer's overall satisfaction.
