Is the UK public ready for genetic medicine?
While discussion about the potential for personalized medicine persists, in the UK embedding pharmacogenetics in mainstream clinical practice will also depend on high levels of confidence and trust of citizens in the motives of stakeholders. The role of Government, regulators and the guidance offered by health practitioners will contribute to its acceptance or otherwise. Nowgen, a center for genetics in healthcare, is dedicated to exploring how health service research, practice and innovation, in relation to genetic medicine, are informed and perceived by the public. In 2006, Nowgen commissioned a national polling organization, ICM, to carry out a representative survey of UK public attitudes to key questions related to genetic medicine, in order to help inform its future activity. The survey indicated that the UK public is relatively well informed about the contribution made by genes to common and complex disease and that it is fairly optimistic about the role of genetics in the treatment of a range of medical conditions. A significant proportion of the population seem reticent to subscribe to genetic testing in order to personalize drug prescription, although the rationale for resistance is, as yet, unclear.
