CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms in Southern Mexican Mayan Lacandones and Mestizos from Chiapas.
In previous CYP2D6 genotyping studies in Mexican-Amerindians a very low frequency of poor metabolizers (PMs) has been reported. Moreover, ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) status has only been analyzed in some groups from Northern Mexico.
