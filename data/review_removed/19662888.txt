[Application of warfarin pharmacogenetics].
Even with its narrow therapeutic index, interindividual variability in daily dose and possible serious bleeding complications, is warfarin the mainstay of therapy and prevention of thromboembolic disease. The application of pharmacogenetics in testing individual polymorphisms of two genes CYP 2C9 (pharmacokinetics of warfarin) and VKORC1 (sensitivity on warfarin) is promising tactics leading to a safe anticoagulation. The first of two applications of pharmacogenetics is assesment of the daily dose of warfarin for individual patients even before starting the therapy. The second is the risk stratification of already warfarinized patients: The carriers of variant genotype are in a greater risk of bleeding complications. The following article is dedicated to the evaluation of literature and our own laboratory and clinical experience with these applications in clinical practise.
