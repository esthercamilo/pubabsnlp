Association between genetic variants and the risk of nivolumab-induced immune-related adverse events.
<b>Aim:</b> We sought to identify the variants that could predict the risk of nivolumab-induced immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with cancer. <b>Patients & methods:</b> We enrolled 622 Japanese patients and carried out a genome-wide association study. The associations for 507 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing p < 0.001 were further investigated using an independent cohort. <b>Results:</b> In the combined analysis, possible associations were found for a total of 90 SNPs. Although no SNPs were identified to be significantly associated with nivolumab-induced irAEs, the SNP most strongly associated with nivolumab-induced irAEs was rs469490. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study is an important hypothesis-generating study to guide future studies in larger and/or other ethnic cohorts.
