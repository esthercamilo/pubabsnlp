Influence of <i>CYP2B6</i> Genotype on Methadone Dosage in Patients from the Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) Program in Pereira, Colombia.
Methadone treatment reduces the use of heroin and withdrawal symptoms; however, methadone is an expensive medication with a narrow safety margin. We compared the retention rates, persistence of heroin use, and quality of life of a group of patients undergoing conventional Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) with a group for whom the <i>CYP2B6</i> 516G>T polymorphism was used in addition to the MMT to calculate the required methadone dose. Over 12 weeks, the retention rate, heroin usage, and quality of life of patients under conventional treatment (n = 34) were compared with those of patients for whom we used genetic markers to calculate methadone dosage (n = 38). At the end of the study, 26.4% of patients abandoned the program, and neither demographic nor clinical variables were associated with treatment adherence. Of the remaining patients, 16% of the control group and 8% of patients in the pharmacogenetic group reported heroin use, while both groups showed a 64% reduction in the use of cocaine/crack (no significant differences between the groups were found). Starting in the second week, the methadone dosage was lower among the patients for whom methadone was prescribed based on genotype. Although there were six individuals in the control group and three in the pharmacogenetic group with QTc intervals > 450 ms (a threshold that is considered dangerous), we did not find a relationship between the QTc interval and methadone dosage. There were no differences in the perception of quality of life between the two groups. The results of this pilot study suggest that concerning methadone therapy, the <i>CYP2B6</i> genotype contributes to reduced effective doses and treatment costs.
