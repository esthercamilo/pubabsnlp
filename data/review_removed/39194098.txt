Influence of IL-β, IL-1RN, and TNF-α variants on the risk of acetylsalicylic acid-induced upper gastrointestinal bleeding: a case-control study.
Forgerini et al. investigated the role of seven genetic variants in the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding as an adverse drug reaction. In 289 participants (50 cases and 189 controls), the presence of seven variants in the IL-1β, IL-1RN, and TNF-α genes was not associated with susceptibility to acetylsalicylic acid-induced upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The use of acetylsalicylic acid, even in low doses, may be associated with the onset of upper gastrointestinal bleeding as an idiosyncratic response. Considering the role of the genetic background in inter-individual responses to pharmacotherapy, we aimed to investigate the role of seven variants in the TNF-α, IL-β, and IL-1RN genes in association with the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in users of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid for the prevention of cardiovascular events.
