The importance of buprenorphine research in the opioid crisis.
With the urgency to treat patients more effectively for opioid use disorder in the midst of the opioid epidemic, a key area for precision medicine is to improve individualized medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. The expansion of medication-assisted treatment is a key to reducing illicit opioid use, preventing opioid overdose deaths, and reducing the comorbidities and societal impacts of opioid use disorder. The most common medication for opioid use disorder will soon be buprenorphine. Research to date shows the successful impact of buprenorphine treatment, including the pharmacogenomics of buprenorphine response and treatment efficacy. Buprenorphine is also a promising treatment for depression and anxiety, and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). However, the rates of success with medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder, particularly at the beginning of treatment, still show many individuals relapsing to illicit opioid use. With the scope of the opioid crisis, there is an urgent need for expansion of buprenorphine treatment research to provide critical information for improving outcomes of opioid use disorder. Implementing the best strategies for opioid use disorder treatment is of dire urgency and will save lives.
