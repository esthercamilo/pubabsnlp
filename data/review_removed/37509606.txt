Interleukin 5 Receptor Subunit Alpha Expression as a Potential Biomarker in Patients with Nasal Polyposis.
Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis (CRSwNP) affects the quality of life of patients suffering from it. The search for a suitable biomarker has been conducted over the last decades. Interleukin 5 receptor subunit alpha (IL-5Rα) involves the activation, maintenance, and survival of eosinophils, which are highly tied to chronic inflammatory processes of the airways, like asthma or CRSwNP. In this study, we evaluate the utility of <i>IL5RA</i> as a genetic biomarker in CRSwNP. <i>IL5RA</i> mRNA expression level was analyzed in different groups of patients by performing qPCR assays. A significant increase in <i>IL5RA</i> expression was observed in CRSwNP patients, especially those with asthma and atopy. We found differences in expression levels when comparing groups with or without polyposis or asthma, as well as some atypical cases related to eosinophil levels. That opens a path to future studies to further characterize groups of patients with common features in the context of pharmacogenetics and in an era towards developing a more precise personalized treatment with IL-5Rα as a therapeutic target for CRSwNP.
