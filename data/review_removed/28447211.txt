Paclitaxel-induced sensory peripheral neuropathy is associated with an ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphism and older age in Japanese.
Whether age and inter-individual variability of pharmacogenetics are risk factors for paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) is inconclusive. This study was conducted to evaluate the influence of previously investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and age, using genotype data from a prospective study of paclitaxel-related toxicity in Japanese patients with breast cancer.
