Pharmacogenetics of cytochrome P450 (CYP) in the elderly.
The genetics of cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a very active area of multidisciplinary research, overlapping the interest of medicine, biology and pharmacology, being the CYP enzyme system responsible for the metabolism of more than 80% of the commercially available drugs. Variations in CYP encoding genes are responsible for inter-individual differences in CYP production or function, with severe clinical consequences as therapeutic failures (TFs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), being ADRs worldwide primary causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly people. In fact, the prevalence of both TFs and ADRs strongly increased in the presence of multiple pharmacological treatments, a common status in subjects aging 65 years and over. The present article explored some basic concepts of human genetics that have important implications in the genetics of CYP. An attempted to transfer these basic concepts to the genetic data reported by the Home Page of The Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Committee was also made, focusing on the current knowledge of CYP genetics. The status of what we know and what we need to know is the base for the clinical applications of pharmacogenetics, in which personalized drug treatments constituted the main aim, in particular in patients attending a geriatric ward.
