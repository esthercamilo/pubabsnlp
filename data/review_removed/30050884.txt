Pharmacogenomics of Sulfonylureas Response in Relation to rs7754840 Polymorphisms in Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 Regulatory Subunit-associated Protein 1-like (CDKAL1) Gene in Iranian Type 2 Diabetes Patients.
Sulfonylureas are important drugs of choice for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is suggested that differential response to sulfonylureas from T2DM patients is under influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in some of the target genes. In spite of favorable therapeutic effects, sulfonylureas are associated with some adverse side effects such as microvascular complications and stroke, especially in older patients. Therefore, for T2DM patients who are getting less benefit, sulfonylureas should be avoided. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like (CDKAL1) gene variation is reported to be associated with sulfonylureas effectiveness. Due to the inconsistency of available data regarding association of rs7754840 in CDKAL1 gene with sulfonylureas response in T2DM patients, the present study is conducted.
