Estimating the Potential Impact of <i>CYP2C19</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i> Genetic Testing on Protocol-Based Care for Depression in Canada and the United States.
The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) algorithm is the most recognized protocol-based care approach for moderate to severe depression. However, its implementation results in one-third of individuals receiving modest to no symptom remission. One possible explanation is the inter-individual differences in antidepressant metabolism due to <i>CYP2C19</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i>genetic variation. Here, we aimed to determine the potential benefit of pairing <i>CYP2C19</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i>testing with the five-step STAR*D algorithm. To estimate the proportion of individuals that could benefit from <i>CYP2C19</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i> testing, we simulated the STAR*D algorithm using ethnicity-specific phenotype (e.g., metabolizer status) frequencies published by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and census data from the Canada and the US. We found that up to one-third of the US and Canadian populations being treated for depression could benefit from the addition of <i>CYP2C19</i>and <i>CYP2D6</i> genetic testing. The potential benefit varied for each step of the algorithm and for each province, territory, and state. <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping had the greatest potential impact within the first two steps of the algorithm, while <i>CYP2D6</i> genotyping had the most notable impact in Steps 3, 4, and 5. Our findings suggest the implementation of <i>CYP2C19</i>and <i>CYP2D6</i> genetic testing alongside the STAR*D treatment algorithm may improve depression treatment outcomes in Canada and the US.
