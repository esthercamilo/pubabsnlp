Clopidogrel Pharmacogenetics in Iranian Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.
Clopidogrel is used in patients with coronary syndromes and at risk of thrombotic events or receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for reducing heart attack and stroke. Here we present genotype and phenotype study of Iranian patients undergoing PCI treated with clopidogrel during a 6-month period of follow-up; common variants of CYP2C19, CYP3A5, CYP3A4, and ABCB1 genes were determined as well as the patients' cardiovascular outcomes to find out the effect of these variants individually and in combination. 388 individuals receiving PCI were enrolled in this study. Different pretreatment doses of clopidogrel were prescribed under the interventional cardiologists' guidance. The patients were followed for a duration of 1 month, and 6 months. Six SNPs were selected for genotyping including CYP2C19*2 (c.681G > A), CYP2C19*3 (c.636G > A), CYP2C19*17 allele (c.-806C > T), ABCB1 (c.3435C > T), CYP3A5 (c.6986A > G), and CYP3A4 (c.1026 + 12G > A). The mean loading dose was 600 mg/day in 267 (68.8%) individuals, 300 mg/day in 121 (31.2%). 8 patients had cardiovascular events such as thrombosis, unstable angina, and non-STEMI. The studied alleles and genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. None of the SNPs individually were significantly associated with outcome events. Our results indicate that combinations of different alleles of genes are involved in pharmacokinetic variability and joint factors are important; this means that genotyping and analysis of an individual variant may not be as straightforward in risk assessment and pharmacogenetics. This highlights the importance of personalized medicine in risk assessment and treatment.
