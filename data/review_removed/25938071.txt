HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions in Vietnamese.
In Vietnam, we observed a high incidence of carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCARs)-Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug-induced hypersensitivity rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). In other Asian countries, HLA-B(*)1502 is an established risk factor for SCARs.
