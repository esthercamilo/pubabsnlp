Using the PharmCAT tool for Pharmacogenetic clinical decision support.
Here, we will provide our insights into the usage of PharmCAT as part of a pharmacogenetic clinical decision support pipeline, which addresses the challenges in mapping clinical dosing guidelines to variants to be extracted from genetic datasets. After a general outline of pharmacogenetics, we describe some features of PharmCAT and how we integrated it into a pharmacogenetic clinical decision support system within a clinical information system. We conclude with promising developments regarding future PharmCAT releases.
