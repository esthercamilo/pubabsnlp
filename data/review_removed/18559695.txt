Alternative splicing of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase is associated with plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to simvastatin.
HMGCR(3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase), the direct target of statin inhibition, undergoes alternative splicing of exon 13, which encodes part of the statin-binding domain of the enzyme. We hypothesized that HMGCR alternative splicing might be related to the interindividual variation in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to statin treatment.
