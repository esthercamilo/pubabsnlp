MTHFR polymorphisms and capecitabine-induced toxicity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
The availability of current chemotherapeutic options for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has increased survival, but it is also accompanied by considerable morbidity. Fluoropyrimidines are the mainstay of systemic therapy. Germline pharmacogenetic markers involved in 5-fluorouracil pharmacodynamics could provide individualized pretreatment tools for predicting toxicity. Research on methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphisms and fluoropyrimidine treatment outcome has focused on intravenous 5-fluorouracil and has yielded inconclusive results. The literature on pharmacogenetics in capecitabine-based chemotherapy is scarce. Therefore, we analysed the association of MTHFR gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of serious toxicity of first-line capecitabine monotherapy and combination therapy.
