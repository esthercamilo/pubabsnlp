Multiple sclerosis treatment effects on plasma cytokine receptor levels.
Genetic variants within some cytokine receptor genes have been associated with MS susceptibility, including IL7RA and IL2RA. As these genes are expressed by cells targeted by immune-modulatory drugs, we explored the potential role of their gene products as biomarkers in monitoring MS treatment. We assessed the impact of natalizumab followed by fingolimod on the intra-individual changes of plasma protein levels of sIL-7Rα, sIL-2Rα and also sIL-6R and sgp130 in MS patients. During natalizumab treatment we observed a decline in sgp130 and sIL-7Rα levels, while subsequent fingolimod treatment lead to increased sgp130 and sIL-7Rα and decreased sIL-2Rα levels. In addition, during fingolimod treatment sIL-7Rα levels were increasing significantly more in patients homozygous for the MS risk genotype of rs6897932. We also observed an effect of the MS associated rs71624119 on sgp130 levels. These results may elucidate the pharmacodynamics of treatments and help identify biomarkers for MS outcomes.
