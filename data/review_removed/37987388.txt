An EMR-Based Approach to Determine Frequency, Prescribing Pattern, and Characteristics of Patients Receiving Drugs with Pharmacogenomic Guidelines.
(1) Background: This retrospective analysis utilizing electronic medical record (EMR) data from a tertiary integrated health system sought to identify patients and prescribers who would benefit from pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing based on Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines. (2) Methods: EMR data from a clinical research data warehouse were analyzed from 845,518 patients that had an encounter between 2015 and 2019 at an academic medical center. Data were collected for 42 commercially available drugs with 52 evidence-based PGx guidelines from CPIC. Provider data were obtained through the EMR linked by specialty via national provider identification (NPI) number. (3) Results: A total of 845,518 patients had an encounter in the extraction period with 590,526 medication orders processed. A total of 335,849 (56.9%) patients had medication orders represented by CPIC drugs prescribed by 2803 providers, representing 239 distinct medications. (4) Conclusions: The results from this study show that over half of patients were prescribed a CPIC actionable medication from a variety of prescriber specialties. Understanding the magnitude of patients that may benefit from PGx testing, will enable the development of preemptive testing processes, physician support strategies, and pharmacist workflows to optimize outcomes should a PGx service be implemented.
