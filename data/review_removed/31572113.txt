Preliminary Clinical Investigation of Combinatorial Pharmacogenomic Testing for the Optimized Treatment of Depression: A Randomized Single-Blind Study.
This study aims to explore the potential benefits of antidepressant drugs related to metabolic enzyme and drug-targeted genes, identify the optimal treatment of major depression, and provide a reference for individualized medication selection. A prospective randomized single-blind investigation was conducted for 8 weeks. A pharmacogenomic-based interpretive report was provided to the treating physician in the guided group. Patients in this group were informed that their medication selection was directed by DNA testing. In the unguided group, treatment was provided based on the clinical experience of the physician without the guidance of pharmacogenomic testing. Pharmacogenomic-based interpretive report was not provided to these patients until treatment completion. The 17-item Hamilton depression scale (HAMD-17), Hamilton anxiety scale, and treatment emergent symptom scale were used to assess the clinical efficacy and side effects at baseline and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment. Among the 80 initially enrolled patients with depression, 71 participated in the full data analysis sets and were designated into guided (31) and unguided (40) groups, respectively. No significant difference (<i>P</i> > 0.05) in HAMD-17 total scores, response and remission rates was found between the guided and unguided groups at the end of the treatment. The incidence rate of adverse reaction was 55.56% in guided group and 57.89% in the unguided group. Our study suggested that pharmacogenomic testing might not considerably improve the clinical efficiency and safety for the guided group.
