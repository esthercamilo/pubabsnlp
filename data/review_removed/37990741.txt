Case report of PLXNA4 variant associated with hyper-response to phentermine/topiramate pharmacotherapy: Potential genetic basis for superior weight loss response?
Once thought to be primarily a result of lifestyle, it is now known that obesity has significant genetic components. Dozens of genes have been linked to obesity, and office-based genetic testing for obesity-associated genes is now readily available. As both pharmacotherapy and genetic testing for obesity become more accessible, pharmacogenetic personalization is becoming a reality. In this case report, a patient with a PLXNA4 polymorphism had a superior weight loss response to phentermine/topiramate therapy than has previously been reported in the literature. Thus, variants in PLXNA4 may provide a genetic basis for this patient's superior response to weight loss pharmacotherapy and cardiovascular risk factor reduction.
