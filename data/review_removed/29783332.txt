Company Profile: GenesFX Health Pty Ltd.
GenesFX Health (Melbourne, Australia) is providing genetic testing with clinical interpretation to personalize how people take medications. The company's aim is to achieve the best health outcomes for patients by ensuring that the way they metabolize medications is included when doctors prescribe them medication. This would be achieved by introducing pharmacogenomics into medical practice to provide more informed prescribing, reduce side effects and create maximum efficacy of medications. Through the use of GenesFX Health innovative genetic test, DNAdose<sup>Â®</sup>, GenesFX Health is able to analyze the profile of a patient's genetic variation and maps this to the optimum drug and dosage for a specific treatment. The company's focus on the interpretation of genetic test results has led to the development of a Pharmacogenomic Database and Pharmacogenomic Interpretation System, which allows the team to communicate complex genetic test results in a meaningful way to doctors. There is a significant opportunity to expand GenesFX Health current model of delivering pharmacogenomic tests, by partnering with other laboratories around the world, making pharmacogenomics more accessible and clinically useful. Doctors using the service have welcomed the clinical guidance. Patients have felt relieved and empowered by understanding why they have adverse reactions to medications, and which medications and doses are most suited to them.
