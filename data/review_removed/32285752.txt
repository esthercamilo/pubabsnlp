Identification of host variants associated with overall survival of esophageal cancer patients receiving platinum-based therapy.
<b>Aim:</b> Clinical features of esophageal cancer (EC) patients have poor prognostic power. Thus, it is paramount to discover biomarkers that can allow a more accurate survival prediction. <b>Methods:</b> To detect genetic variants associated with survival, DNA from 120 patients treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant therapy were genotyped using drug metabolism enzymes and transporters array. <b>Results:</b> We identified two variants: the rs2038067 in <i>PPARD</i> (p = 0.0004) and the rs683369 (F160L) in <i>SLC22A1</i> (p = 0.001). Their prognostic power was greater than that of clinical stage alone (p = 0.017) and comparable to that of response to neoadjuvant therapy (p = 0.71). Interestingly, the prognostic accuracy of response models increased significantly when genetic variables were included (p = 0.003). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our data, though preliminary, strengthen the potential utility of germline variants for a better-tailored management of EC patients.
