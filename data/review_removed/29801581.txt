Epigenetics and MicroRNAs in Pharmacogenetics.
Germline pharmacogenetics has so far mainly studied common variants in "pharmacogenes," i.e., genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (DMET genes), certain auxiliary and regulatory genes, and drug target genes. Despite remarkable progress in understanding genetically determined differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs, currently known common variants even in important pharmacogenes explain genetic variability only partially. This suggests "missing heritability" that may in part be due to rare variants in the classical pharmacogenes, but current evidence suggests that largely unexplored resources with potential for pharmacogenetics exist, both within already known pharmacogenes and in entirely new areas. In particular, recent studies suggest that epigenetic processes and noncoding RNAs, including mostly microRNAs (miRNAs), represent important and largely unexplored layers of DMET gene regulation that may fill some of the gaps in understanding interindividual variability and lead to new biomarkers. In this chapter we summarize recent advances in the understanding of genetic variability in epigenetic and miRNA-mediated processes with focus on their significance for DMET regulation and pharmacokinetic or pharmacological endpoints.
