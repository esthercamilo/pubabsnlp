Differences in peptic ulcer between the East and the West.
PUD affects both the East and the West. The magnitude of the problem, however, varies within these regions. The study of peptic ulcer epidemiology is impeded by the paucity of general population-based data, invasiveness of diagnostic tests, and variable access to testing facilities. As such, direct comparisons of PUD epidemiology between the East and the West are difficult. The prevalence rates of H pylori are highly variable and depend greatly on the local sanitation conditions. The use of NSAIDs and aspirin is ubiquitous and increasing especially for the antiplatelet activity of aspirin in the prophylaxis of cardiovascular events. There is evidence that pharmacogenetics play a role in susceptibility to the ulcerogenic properties of NSAIDs. The prevalence of PUD parallels the risk factors, but emerging in both the East and the West is idiopathic PUD, now a substantial proportion of ulcers in areas of declining H pylori infection. Genetic polymorphisms affect the efficacy of treatment using PPIs. Local H pylori resistance rates also influence the eradication success rates.
