Comparison of clinical pharmacogenetic recommendations across therapeutic areas.
Evaluations from pharmacogenetics implementation programs at major US medical centers have reported variability in the clinical adoption of pharmacogenetics across therapeutic areas. A potential cause for this variability may involve therapeutic area-specific differences in published pharmacogenetics recommendations to clinicians. To date, however, the potential for differences in clinical pharmacogenetics recommendations by therapeutic areas from prominent US guidance sources has not been assessed. Accordingly, our objective was to comprehensively compare essential elements from clinical pharmacogenetics recommendations contained within Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines, US Food and Drug Administration drug labels and clinical practice guidelines from US professional medical organizations across therapeutic areas.
