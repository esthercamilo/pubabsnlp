Pharmacogenomic profiling of the PI3K/PTEN pathway in sporadic breast cancer.
Pharmacogenomics is the study of genetic variations among individuals to predict the probability that a patient will respond to single or multidrug chemotherapy. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Treatment of breast cancer by application of biological rationales gives us the ability to match the correct pharmacology to individual tumour genetic profiles. The breast cancers exhibit multiple anomalies in phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pathways, such as phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome TEN loss that can be put in context of therapy with rapamycin analogues. Considering the high incidence of breast cancer in Iran, the potential role of tumor suppressor PTEN/MMAC1gene was investigated in Isfahanian breast cancer patients.
