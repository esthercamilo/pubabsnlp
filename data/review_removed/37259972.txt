Healthcare professionals' knowledge, confidence and perceptions of pharmacogenomics in primary care and pain management.
<b>Aim:</b> To assess knowledge, confidence and perceptions of healthcare professionals specializing in primary care and pain management at Brigham and Women's Hospital, related to clinical pharmacogenomics (PGx). <b>Methods:</b> A 25-question online survey was distributed to 328 Brigham and Women's Hospital clinicians for analysis. <b>Results:</b> Thirty-four clinicians completed the survey. Respondents had minimal experience with PGx and limited awareness of PGx resources. Although respondents expressed belief that PGx has utility to improve medication-related patient outcomes, many lack confidence to apply PGx results to their practice. For clinical drug-gene questions relevant to primary care and/or pain management, respondents scored poorly. <b>Conclusion:</b> More clinician education is needed for appropriate utilization of PGx in clinical practice as it pertains to primary care and pain management.
