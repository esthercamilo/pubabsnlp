Influence of NAT2 Genotype and Maturation on Isoniazid Exposure in Low-Birth-Weight and Preterm Infants With or Without Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Exposure.
Isoniazid (INH) metabolism depends on the N-acetyl transferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme, whose maturation process remains unknown in low birth weight (LBW) and preterm infants. We aimed to assess INH exposure and safety in infants receiving oral tuberculosis prevention.
