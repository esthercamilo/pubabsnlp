Genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms related to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Pharmacological treatment of several diseases, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), presents marked variability in efficiency and its adverse effects. The genotyping of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can support the prediction of responses to drugs and the genetic risk of presenting comorbidities associated with ADHD. This study presents two rapid and affordable microarray-based strategies to discriminate three clinically important SNPs in genes ADRA2A, SL6CA2, and OPRM1 (rs1800544, rs5569, and rs1799971, respectively). These approaches are allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (ASO) and a combination of allele-specific amplification (ASA) and solid-phase hybridization. Buccal swab and blood samples taken from ADHD patients and controls were analyzed by ASO, ASA, and a gold-reference method. The results indicated that ASA is superior in genotyping capability and analytical performance.
