Videoconferencing Technology to Facilitate a Pilot Training Course in Advanced Psychopharmacology for Psychiatrists.
Psychopharmacology requires practitioners to continually upgrade knowledge and skills, but attendance at live continuing medical education events presents many barriers. In addition, technology has generated new learning approaches. In response, a videoconference-based course on psychopharmacology was developed and evaluated for feasibility and acceptability. Specific goals included whether learners would engage and whether the technology would work well for both learners and instructors. Additional aims included providing guideline-concordant psychopharmacology training, enhancing patient safety, and fostering case discussion.
