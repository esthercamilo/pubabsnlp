Considerations When Applying Pharmacogenomics to Your Practice.
Many practitioners who have not had pharmacogenomic education are required to apply pharmacogenomics to their practices. Although many aspects of pharmacogenomics are similar to traditional concepts of drug-drug interactions, there are some differences. We searched PubMed with the search terms pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics (January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2019) and selected articles that supported the application of pharmacogenomics to practice. For inclusion, we gave preference to national and international consortium guidelines for implementation of pharmacogenomics. We discuss special considerations important in the application of pharmacogenomics to assist clinicians with ordering, interpreting, and applying pharmacogenomics in their practices.
