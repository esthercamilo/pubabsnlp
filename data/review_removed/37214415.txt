Calculation of the pharmacogenomics benefit score for patients with medication-related problems.
Unexpected poor efficacy and intolerable adverse effects are medication-related problems that may result from genetic variation in genes encoding key proteins involved in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing can be used in medical practice "pre-emptively" to avoid future patient harm from medications and "reactively" to diagnose medication-related problems following their occurrence. A structured approach to PGx consulting is proposed to calculate the pharmacogenomics benefit score (PGxBS), a patient-centered objective measure of congruency between medication-related problems and patient genotypes. An example case of poor efficacy with multiple medications is presented, together with comments on the potential benefits and limitations of using the PGxBS in medical practice.
