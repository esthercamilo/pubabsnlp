Molecular targeting in the treatment of either advanced or metastatic bladder cancer or both according to the signalling pathways.
An estimated 300,000 new cases of bladder cancer worldwide are diagnosed annually. Although new cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents for either advanced or metastatic bladder cancer or both are used, no improvement in survival has been observed. Indeed, the 5-year survival rate of metastatic bladder cancer is very low (6%). The target-directed approach is an attractive challenge for treating specific genetic alterations involved in progression and metastasis development. This article aims to describe the new targeted therapies available to cure advanced cancer or metastatic bladder cancer or both according to the signalling pathways potentially involved.
