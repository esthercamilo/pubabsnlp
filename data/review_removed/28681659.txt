The Relationship of Genetics, Nursing Practice, and Informatics Tools in 6-Mercaptopurine Dosing in Pediatric Oncology [Formula: see text].
An antileukemic agent prescribed for pediatric oncology patients during the maintenance phase of therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), is highly influenced by genetic variations in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase enzyme. As such, 6-MP must be dosed so that patients with 1 or 2 inactive thiopurine S-methyltransferase alleles will not incur an increased risk for myelosuppression or other toxicities. Informatics tools such as clinical decision support systems are useful for the application of this and similar pharmacogenetics information to the realm of nursing and clinical practice for safe and effective patient care. This article will discuss pharmacogenetics and the associated use of 6-MP; present implications for nursing practice; identify informatics tools such as clinical decision support systems, which can greatly enhance the care of patients whose treatment is based on critical genetic information; and examine the relationship of genetics, nursing practice, and informatics for 6-MP dosing in pediatric oncology.
