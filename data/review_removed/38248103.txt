Genetic Polymorphisms and Tumoral Mutational Profiles over Survival in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients: An Exploratory Study.
Colorectal cancer is a common disease, both in Chile and worldwide. The most widely used chemotherapy schemes are based on 5-fluorouracil (5FU) as the foundational drug (FOLFOX, CapeOX). Genetic polymorphisms have emerged as potential predictive biomarkers of response to chemotherapy, but conclusive evidence is lacking. This study aimed to investigate the role of genetic variants associated with 5FU-based chemotherapy on therapeutic response, considering their interaction with oncogene mutations (<i>KRAS</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>PI3KCA</i>, <i>AKT1</i>, <i>BRAF</i>). In a retrospective cohort of 63 patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer, a multivariate analysis revealed that liver metastases, <i>DPYD</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>, and <i>MTHFR</i> polymorphisms are independent indicators of poor prognosis, irrespective of oncogene mutations. <i>BRAF</i> wild-type status and high-risk drug-metabolism polymorphisms correlated with a poor prognosis in this Chilean cohort. Additionally, findings from the genomics of drug sensitivity (GDSC) project demonstrated that cell lines with wild-type BRAF have higher IC50 values for 5-FU compared to <i>BRAF</i>-mutated cell lines. In conclusion, the genetic polymorphisms <i>DPYD</i><i>rs1801265</i>, <i>ABCB1</i><i>rs1045642</i>, and <i>MTHFR</i><i>rs180113</i> may serve as useful biomarkers for predicting a poor prognosis in patients undergoing 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy, regardless of oncogene mutations.
