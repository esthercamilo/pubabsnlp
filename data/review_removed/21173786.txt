Intuitive pharmacogenetics: spontaneous risperidone dosage is related to CYP2D6, CYP3A5 and ABCB1 genotypes.
The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the quantitative prescription of risperidone (dosage) is related to the patient's metabolic status. Metabolic status was defined in terms of the most relevant polymorphisms of CYP2D6 (*3, *4, *5, *6 and *1xN), CYP3A5 (*3A) and ABCB1 (G2677T) determined a posteriori and blinded to the clinicians. This prospective and observational study includes a cohort of 151 Caucasian psychiatric patients treated with risperidone. Significant differences (Kruskal-Wallis test p=0.01) among the doses administered were observed to correlate (Spearman's r=1, p=0.02) with the different CYP2D6 groups. Poor metabolizers received the lowest doses and ultra rapid metabolizers the highest. No significant correlations were observed with regard to CYP3A5 and ABCB1. We find that, despite not knowing patients' metabolic status, clinicians modify risperidone dosage in order to obtain the best therapeutic option.
