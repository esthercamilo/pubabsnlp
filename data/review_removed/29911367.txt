[Personalized dosing from perspective of pharmacogenomics of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters].
Pharmacogenomics is defined as research into the relationship between inherited genetic variations in drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters and targets and individual variations in personâ€™s response to drugs (fate of drug in human body, safety and efficacy). Personalized dosing is pharmacogenomics-based therapeutic regimen tailored to other individual characteristics. This article summarizes the progress in clinical application of personalized dosing from the perspective of pharmacogenomics of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and proposes to draw attention to key scientific issues (e.g., the effect of multi-genes and non-genetic factors on drug effects, the integration of therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenomics); meanwhile, bottle necks in the clinical application and corresponding strategies are proposed.
