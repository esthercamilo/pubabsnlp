Clinical implications of pharmacogenetic and microarray testing for advanced practice nurses.
The rapidly changing field of pharmacogenetics requires that advanced practice providers have a fundamental foundation in genetics and genetic testing on which new knowledge can be built. Testing for allelic variation in the well-researched Cytochrome P450 pathways and other pathways of drug metabolism is done through microarray testing. Understanding the process microarray testing provides a framework for understanding pharmacogenetic testing.
