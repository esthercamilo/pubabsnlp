Protein network and pathway analysis in a pharmacogenetic study of cyclosporine treatment response in Greek patients with psoriasis.
Although cyclosporine comprises a well-established systemic therapy for psoriasis, patients show important heterogeneity in their treatment response. The aim of our study was the pharmacogenetic analysis of 200 Greek patients with psoriasis based on the cyclosporine pathway related protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, reconstructed through the PICKLE meta-database. We genotyped 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms, mapped to 22 key protein nodes of the cyclosporine pathway, via the utilization of the iPLEX®GOLD panel of the MassARRAY® System. Single-SNP analyses showed statistically significant associations between CALM1 rs12885713 (P = 0.0108) and MALT1 rs2874116 (P = 0.0006) polymorphisms with positive response to cyclosporine therapy after correction for multiple comparisons, with the haplotype analyses further enhancing the predictive value of rs12885713 as a pharmacogenetic biomarker for cyclosporine therapy (P = 0.0173). Our findings have the potential to improve our prediction of cyclosporine efficacy and safety in psoriasis patients, as well as provide the framework for the pharmacogenetics of biological therapies in complex diseases.
