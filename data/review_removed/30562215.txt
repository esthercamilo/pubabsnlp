Gene expression changes in lymphoblastoid cell lines and primary B cells by dexamethasone.
Human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) have been thought to be a useful model system for pharmacogenomics studies. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of Epstein-Barr virus transformation on gene expression changes by dexamethasone (Dex) in LCLs and primary B cells (PBCs) derived from the same individuals.
