Pharmacogenetics and schizophrenia.
The wide interindividual variability in clinical response and tolerability of antipsychotic medications has led investigators to postulate that these variabilities may be under genetic control. Although not always consistent, there are promising indications from emergent pharmacogenetic studies that efficacy of antipsychotic medications for the various symptom domains of psychopathology in schizophrenia may be genetically regulated. This is an encouraging approach. Moreover, there are also suggestive findings that the side-effect profiles of second-generation antipsychotic medications and their propensity to cause weight gain and glucose and lipid abnormalities as well as tardive dyskinesia may be related to pharmacogenetic factors in this patient population. Ultimately, such approaches could drive choices of antipsychotic medication based on the likelihood of clinical response and development of side effects in light of a particular patient's genetic profile. In the future, this targeted approach (personalized medicine) may become informative for clinicians choosing an antipsychotic medication for an individual patient with schizophrenia.
