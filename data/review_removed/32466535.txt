Pharmacogenetics in Model-Based Optimization of Bevacizumab Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) are significant regulators of angiogenesis, an important biological process involved in carcinogenesis. Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (MAB), is approved for the treatment of metastatic Colorectal cancer (mCRC), however clinical outcomes are highly variable. In the present study, we developed a pharmacokinetic (PK), a simplified quasi-steady state (QSS) and a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model to identify potential sources of variability. A total of 46 mCRC patients, who received bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy were studied. <i>VEGF-A</i> (rs2010963, rs1570360, rs699947) and <i>ICAM-1</i> (rs5498, rs1799969) genes' polymorphisms, age, gender, weight, and dosing scheme were investigated as possible co-variates of the model's parameters. Polymorphisms, trough, and peak levels of bevacizumab, and free VEGF-A were determined in whole blood and serum. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. The two-compartment PK model showed that clearance (CL) was significantly lower in patients with mutant <i>ICAM-1</i> rs1799969 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), inter-compartmental clearance (Q) was significantly higher with mutant <i>VEGF-A</i> rs1570360 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), and lower in patients with mutant <i>VEGF-A</i> rs699947 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The binding QSS model also showed that mutant <i>ICAM-1</i> rs1799969 was associated with a lower CL (<i>p</i> = 0.0177). Mutant <i>VEGF-A</i> rs699947 was associated with a lower free VEGF-A levels, prior to the next dose (<i>p</i> = 0.000445). The above results were confirmed by the PK/PD model. Findings of the present study indicated that variants of the genes regulating angiogenesis might affect PK and PD characteristics of bevacizumab, possibly influencing the clinical outcomes.
