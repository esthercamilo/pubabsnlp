Star Allele-Based Haplotyping versus Gene-Wise Variant Burden Scoring for Predicting 6-Mercaptopurine Intolerance in Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Patients.
<i>Nudix Hydrolase 15 (NUDT15)</i> and <i>Thiopurine S-Methyltransferase (TPMT)</i> are strong genetic determinants of thiopurine toxicity in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Since patients with <i>NUDT15</i> or <i>TPMT</i> deficiency suffer severe adverse drug reactions, star (*) allele-based haplotypes have been used to predict an optimal 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) dosing. However, star allele haplotyping suffers from insufficient, inconsistent, and even conflicting designations with uncertain and/or unknown functional alleles. Gene-wise variant burden (GVB) scoring enables us to utilize next-generation sequencing (NGS) data to predict 6-MP intolerance in children with ALL. Whole exome sequencing was performed for 244 pediatric ALL patients under 6-MP treatments. We assigned star alleles with PharmGKB haplotype set translational table. GVB for <i>NUDT15</i> and <i>TPMT</i> was computed by aggregating <i>in silico</i> deleteriousness scores of multiple coding variants for each gene. Poor last-cycle dose intensity percent (DIP < 25%) was considered as 6-MP intolerance, resulting therapeutic failure of ALL. DIPs showed significant differences ( <i>p</i> < 0.05) among <i>NUDT15</i> poor (PM, <i>n</i> = 1), intermediate (IM, <i>n</i> = 48), and normal (NM, <i>n</i> = 195) metabolizers. <i>TPMT</i> exhibited no PM and only seven IMs. GVB showed significant differences among the different haplotype groups of both <i>NUDT15</i> and <i>TPMT</i> ( <i>p</i> < 0.05). Kruskal-Wallis test for DIP values showed statistical significances for the seven different GVB score bins of <i>NUDT15</i>. GVB <i><sup>NUDT15</sup></i> outperformed the star allele-based haplotypes in predicting patients with reduced last-cycle DIPs at all DIP threshold levels (i.e., 5%, 10%, 15%, and 25%). In <i>NUDT15</i>-and-<i>TPMT</i> combined interaction analyses, GVB <i><sup>NUDT15</sup></i> <sup>,</sup> <i><sup>TPMT</sup></i> outperformed star alleles [area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) = 0.677 vs. 0.645] in specificity (0.813 vs. 0.796), sensitivity (0.526 vs. 0.474), and positive (0.192 vs. 0.164) and negative (0.953 vs. 0.947) predictive values. Overall, GVB correctly classified five more patients (i.e., one into <i>below</i> and four into <i>above 25% DIP</i> groups) than did star allele haplotypes. GVB analysis demonstrated that 6-MP intolerance in pediatric ALL can be reliably predicted by aggregating NGS-based common, rare, and novel variants together without hampering the predictive power of the conventional haplotype analysis.
