Personalizing Personalized Medicine: The Confluence of Pharmacogenomics, a Person's Medication Experience and Ethics.
Truly personalized precision medicine combines pharmacogenomics (PGx), a person's lived medication experiences and ethics; person-centeredness lies at the confluence of these considerations. A person-centered perspective can help inform PGx-related treatment guidelines, shared decision-making for PGx-related therapeutics and PGx-related healthcare policy. This article examines the interplay between these components of person-centered PGx-related care. Ethics concepts addressed include privacy, confidentiality, autonomy, informed consent, fiduciary responsibility, respect, the burden of pharmacogenomics knowledge for both the patient and healthcare provider and the pharmacist's ethical role in PGx-testing. Incorporating the patient's lived medication experience and ethics principles into PGx-based discussions of treatment can optimize the ethical, person-centered application of PGx testing to patient care.
