<i>SLCO1B1</i> and <i>ABCB1</i> variants synergistically influence the atorvastatin treatment response in South Indian coronary artery disease patients.
<b>Introduction:</b> Atorvastatin exhibits wide interindividual variability in treatment response, limiting the drug efficacy in coronary artery disease patients. <b>Aim:</b> To study the effect of genetic variants involved in atorvastatin transport/metabolism and correlate their lipid-lowering efficacy. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Genotyping was performed using 5'-hydrolysis probe method (n = 412), and the study evaluated the treatment response in 86 patients. <b>Results:</b> Significant reduction in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were observed in <i>SLCO1B1</i>-rs4149056, rs4363657 and <i>ABCB1</i>-rs1045642 genotypes. The combined genotypes of <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>SLCO1B1</i> showed a strong synergistic effect in reducing the total cholesterol and LDL-C. Diabetes and smoking were observed to influence the LDL-C reduction. <b>Conclusion:</b> The genetic variants of <i>SLCO1B1</i> and <i>ABCB1</i> predict the lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin, and this may be useful in genotype-guided statin therapy for coronary artery disease patients.
