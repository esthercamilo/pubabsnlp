The role of pharmacogenomics in precision psychiatry.
The field of psychiatry is facing an important paradigm shift in the provision of clinical care and mental health service organization toward personalization and integration of multimodal data science. This approach, termed precision psychiatry, aims at identifying subgroups of patients more prone to the development of a certain phenotype, such as symptoms or severe mental disorders (risk detection), and/or to guide treatment selection. Pharmacogenomics and computational psychiatryÂ are two fundamental tools of precision psychiatry, which have seen increasing levels of integration in clinical settings. Here we present a brief overview of these two applications of precision psychiatry in clinical settings.
