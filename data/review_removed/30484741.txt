Continuing war on pain: a personalized approach to the therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids.
Successful pain management requires the delivery of analgesia with minimal risk of adverse drug reactions. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids remain the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients. Unfortunately, almost 50% of all patients experience inadequate pain relief and serious side effects. Allelic variants in genes coding for target proteins, transporters and enzymes, which govern analgesic drugs action and their fate in the organism, might explain inter-individual variability in pain severity and in drug-induced pain relief and toxicities. Additionally, it seems that epigenetic changes contribute to the highly variable response to pain treatment. Therefore, pharmacogenomic testing might be a valuable tool for personalization of pain treatment, with a multidisciplinary team approach involved.
