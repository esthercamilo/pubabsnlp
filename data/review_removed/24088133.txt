Pharmacogenetics of topical and systemic treatment of psoriasis.
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. The cause of psoriasis is unknown, although genetics may play a key role in its development. Treatment of the disease varies with severity. Topical drugs, such as corticosteroids, coal tar, retinoids and vitamin D analogs, are commonly used to treat mild psoriasis. Phototherapy and systemic drugs, such as calcineurin inhibitors, methotrexate, acitretin and biological drugs, are usually used to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Not all patients respond well to treatment, and some can develop severe adverse effects. Interindividual differences in several genes may explain this variation in response to treatment. Pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics can facilitate more personalized medicine and prevent the adverse effects associated with treatment.
