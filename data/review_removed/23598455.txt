Clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics: more than one gene at a time.
Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) clinical pharmacogenetic implementation guidelines for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes highlight the importance of both genes. However, studies of the combined impact of the two genes are sparse, limiting the ability to make strong recommendations based on both genes. The warfarin pharmacogenetics literature highlights the strength of a multigenic approach for discovery and clinical implementation. For optimal impact and interpretation, investigators are encouraged to conduct studies in the context of previously well-defined pharmacogenetics markers.
