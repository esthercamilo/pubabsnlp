Pharmacogenetics and Adverse Events in the Use of Fluoropyrimidine in a Cohort of Cancer Patients on Standard of Care Treatment in Zimbabwe.
Fluoropyrimidines are commonly used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. They are, however, associated with adverse events (AEs), of which gastrointestinal, myelosuppression and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia are the most common. Clinical guidelines are used for fluoropyrimidine dosing based on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (<i>DPYD</i>) genetic polymorphism and have been shown to reduce these AEs in patients of European ancestry. This study aimed to evaluate, for the first time, the clinical applicability of these guidelines in a cohort of cancer patients on fluoropyrimidine standard of care treatment in Zimbabwe. DNA was extracted from whole blood and used for <i>DPYD</i> genotyping. Adverse events were monitored for six months using the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) v.5.0. None of the 150 genotyped patients was a carrier of any of the pathogenic variants (<i>DPYD</i>*2A, <i>DPYD</i>*13, rs67376798, or rs75017182). However, severe AEs were high (36%) compared to those reported in the literature from other populations. There was a statistically significant association between BSA (<i>p</i> = 0.0074) and BMI (<i>p</i> = 0.0001) with severe global AEs. This study has shown the absence of the currently known actionable <i>DPYD</i> variants in the Zimbabwean cancer patient cohort. Therefore, the current pathogenic variants in the guidelines might not be feasible for all populations hence the call for modification of the current <i>DPYD</i> guidelines to include minority populations for the benefit of all diverse patients.
