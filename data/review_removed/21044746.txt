Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism (677 C>T) predicts long time to progression in metastatic colon cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid.
Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is the most common treatment for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (m-CRC). Therapy with 5-FU/folinic acid (FA) continues to be a standard treatment in developing countries. Pharmacogenomics allows the tailoring of cancer therapy to the patient. The polymorphism 677C>T of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene seems to influence the effectiveness of treatment with 5-FU. We undertook this study to evaluate the frequency of MTHFR 677C>T polymorphism and its relationship to the time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in m-CRC treated with 5-FU/FA.
