Pharmacogenomics in treatment of depression and psychosis: an update.
Genetic factors can, to a certain extent, successfully predict the therapeutic effects, metabolism, and adverse reactions of drugs. This research field, pharmacogenomics, is well developed in oncology and is currently expanding in psychiatry. Here, we summarize the latest development in pharmacogenomic psychiatry, where results of several recent large studies indicate a true benefit and cost-effectiveness of pre-emptive genotyping for more successful psychotherapy. However, it is apparent that we still lack knowledge of many additional heritable genetic factors of importance for explanation of the interindividual differences in response to psychiatric drugs. Thus, more effort to further develop pharmacogenomic psychiatry should be invested to achieve a broader clinical implementation.
