Using genetics to inform new therapeutics for diabetes.
The genetic architecture of diabetes has been extensively studied. Numerous genetic markers for diabetes have been reported. However, the translation of such knowledge into clinical interventions has been inadequate. Areas covered: We performed a literature search on various frontiers in diabetes treatment that could be improved using genetic information: (1) understanding the mechanisms of existing antidiabetic drugs, (2) repurposing existing drugs for the treatment of diabetes, (3) complementing clinical trial findings; (4) finding novel treatment approaches; (5) better estimation of the efficacy of metabolic surgery. Expert commentary: The translation of genetic information to clinical intervention requires further study, including the development of an appropriate genetic risk score algorithm for type 2 diabetes. Genomic studies provide empirical explanations for clinical trial findings. Moreover, the mechanisms of antidiabetic drugs should be thoroughly investigated to enable clinical trials and pharmacogenomics studies of these drugs. As metabolic surgery becomes more prevalent for the treatment of diabetes, genetic approaches may improve patient prioritization.
