Evaluation of genotyping methods and the relative cost of pharmacogenomics.
Recently, several methods to assess the quality of cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit in the pharmacogenomic field have become available. A relevant example is the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). NICE forms a diverse clinical Advisory committee, which stimulates Pharma and Academic communities to produce a robust set of data, including the design and data source, for economic models of personalized healthcare. Personalized medicine includes genomic tests of each patients and their disease into their clinical treatments, so as minimize toxicity and maximize benefits. It is well known that Pharmacogenomics (PG) tests, performed before drug treatment, lower overall medical costs and provide higher quality of life and longer life expectancy. In this issue relative costs of genotyping methods and platforms, were evaluated by "manually cured criteria" due to lack of specific guidelines. Finally, with the progress made in this scenario over the next five years, health decision-making may able to accelerating the translation of genetic technologies into routine clinical laboratory.
