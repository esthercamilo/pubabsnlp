Public Attitudes toward Pharmacogenomic Testing and Establishing a Statewide Pharmacogenomics Database in the State of Minnesota.
The clinical adoption and implementation of pharmacogenomics (PGx) beyond academic medical centers remains slow, restricting the general population from benefitting from this important component of personalized medicine. As an initial step in the statewide initiative of PGx implementation in Minnesota, we engaged community members and assessed attitudes towards PGx testing and acceptability of establishing a secure statewide PGx database for clinical and research use among Minnesota residents. Data was collected from 808 adult attendees at the 2021 Minnesota State Fair through an electronic survey. Eighty-four percent of respondents felt comfortable getting a PGx test for clinical care. Most respondents trusted health professionals (78.2%) and researchers (73.0%) to keep their PGx data private. The majority expressed their support and interest in participating in a statewide PGx database for clinical and research use (64-72%). Higher acceptability of the statewide PGx database was associated with younger age, higher education, higher health literacy, having health insurance, and prior genetic testing. The study sample representing Minnesota residents expressed high acceptability of receiving PGx testing and willingness to participate in PGx data sharing for clinical and research use. Community support and engagement are needed to advance PGx implementation and research on the state scale.
