Cost-Effectiveness of Pharmacogenomics-Guided Prescribing to Prevent Gene-Drug-Related Deaths: A Decision-Analytic Model.
<b>Aim:</b> Prospective studies support the clinical impact of pharmacogenomics (PGx)-guided prescribing to reduce severe and potentially fatal adverse effects. Drug-gene interactions (DGIs) preventing potential drug-related deaths have been categorized as "essential" by the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG). The collective clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of this sub-set is yet undetermined. Therefore, we aim to assess impact and cost-effectiveness of "essential" PGx tests for prevention of gene-drug-related deaths, when adopted nation-wide. <b>Methods:</b> We used a decision-analytic model to quantify the number and cost per gene-drug-related death prevented, from a 1-year Dutch healthcare perspective. The modelled intervention is a single gene PGx-test for <i>CYP2C19, DPYD, TPMT or UGT1A1</i> to guide prescribing based on the DPWG recommendations among patients in the Netherlands initiating interacting drugs (clopidogrel, capecitabine, systemic fluorouracil, azathioprine, mercaptopurine, tioguanine or irinotecan). <b>Results:</b> For 148,128 patients initiating one of seven drugs in a given year, costs for PGx-testing, interpretation, and drugs would increase by €21.4 million. Of these drug initiators, 35,762 (24.1%) would require an alternative dose or drug. PGx-guided prescribing would relatively reduce gene-drug related mortality by 10.6% (range per DGI: 8.1-14.5%) and prevent 419 (0.3% of initiators) deaths a year. Cost-effectiveness is estimated at €51,000 per prevented gene-drug-related death (range per DGI: €-752,000-€633,000). <b>Conclusion:</b> Adoption of PGx-guided prescribing for "essential" DGIs potentially saves the lives of 0.3% of drug initiators, at reasonable costs.
