The polymorphism rs763780 in the IL-17F gene is associated with response to biological drugs in patients with psoriasis.
Psoriasis improves when IL-17 is blocked. Anti-TNF drugs reduce the IL-17 signaling pathway, and anti-IL-17 drugs are being developed to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis. We analyzed three SNPs in IL-17A (rs2275913 and rs10484879) and IL-17F (rs763780) to look for an association with psoriasis and/or with response to anti-TNF drugs or ustekinumab. We included 197 healthy controls and 194 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The results of the univariate analysis showed an association between rs10484879 and psoriasis, although this relationship disappeared after adjustment for HLA-C (rs12191877). We also found an association between rs763780 (IL-17F) and response to ustekinumab (n = 70) and infliximab (n = 37) at 3 and 6 months and an association between rs763780 and the response to adalimumab at 6 months (n = 67).
