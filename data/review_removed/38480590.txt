Development of a routine bedside CYP2C19 genotype assessment program for antiplatelet therapy guidance in a community hospital catheterization laboratory.
Genotype based personalized antiplatelet therapy in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been studied in clinical trials. Despite the demonstrated risk associated with CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LoF) carriage in clopidogrel-treated PCI patients, real-world implementation of genotyping for PCI has been low. The goal of the current study was to provide CYP2C19 genotype information to the interventionalist prior to the completion of the catheterization to facilitate immediate personalized antiplatelet therapy. Routine personalization of P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor therapy for PCI in a community hospital cardiac catheterization laboratory by POC genotyping with the SpartanRx system was first offered in February 2017. A best practice advisory (BPA) based on the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium Guideline for CYP2C19 genotype and clopidogrel therapy was placed in the electronic health record prescription medication ordering system. By December 2019, 1,052 patients had CYP2C19 genotype testing, 429 patients underwent PCI with genotype guided antiplatelet therapy, and 250 patients underwent PCI without genotype testing and received antiplatelet therapy at the discretion of the treating physician. BPA compliance was 93. 87% of LoF allele carriers were prescribed ticagrelor or prasugrel whereas 96% of non-LoF allele carriers were prescribed clopidogrel. The genotyping results were available within 1 h and made immediately available for decision making by the interventional cardiologist. POC CYP2C19 genotyping is feasible in a community hospital catheterization laboratory and is associated with high rate of best practice compliance.Clinical Trial Registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03040622.
