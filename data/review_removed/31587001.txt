Southeast Asian Pharmacogenomics Research Network (SEAPharm): Current Status and Perspectives.
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is increasingly being recognized as a potential tool for improving the efficacy and safety of drug therapy. Therefore, several efforts have been undertaken globally to facilitate the implementation process of PGx into routine clinical practice. Part of these efforts include the formation of PGx working groups working on PGx research, synthesis, and dissemination of PGx data and creation of PGx implementation strategies. In Asia, the Southeast Asian Pharmacogenomics Research Network (SEAPharm) is established to enable and strengthen PGx research among the various PGx communities within but not limited to countries in SEA; with the ultimate goal to support PGx implementation in the region. From the perspective of SEAPharm member countries, there are several key elements essential for PGx implementation at the national level. They include pharmacovigilance database, PGx research, health economics research, dedicated laboratory to support PGx testing for both research and clinical use, structured PGx education, and supportive national health policy. The status of these essential elements is presented here to provide a broad picture of the readiness for PGx implementation among the SEAPharm member countries, and to strengthen the PGx research network and practice in this region.
