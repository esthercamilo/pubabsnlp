Effects of <i>ADIPOQ</i> and <i>NOS3</i> SNPs/haplotypes on blood pressure control in patients with adherence to antihypertensive therapy.
<b>Aim:</b> We examined whether <i>ADIPOQ</i> (rs266729 and rs1501299) and <i>NOS3</i> (rs3918226 and rs1799983) SNPs or the haplotypes formed by them, affect blood pressure (BP) control in 196 patients with adherence to antihypertensive therapy grouped into controlled (BP <140/90 mmHg) and uncontrolled (BP ≥140/90 mmHg) hypertension. <b>Materials & methods:</b> The average of the three most recent BP measurements was retrieved from the patients' electronic medical records. Adherence to antihypertensive therapy was evaluated using the Morisky-Green test. Haplotype frequencies were estimated using Haplo.stats. Multiple logistic/linear regression analyses were adjusted for the covariates ethnicity, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular disease and uric acid. <b>Results:</b> <i>ADIPOQ</i> rs266729 genotypes CG (additive model) and CG+GG (dominant model) were associated with uncontrolled hypertension and CG was associated with higher systolic BP and mean arterial pressure (p < 0.05). <i>ADIPOQ</i> haplotypes 'GT' and 'GG' were associated with uncontrolled hypertension and 'GT' was associated with higher diastolic BP and mean arterial pressure (p < 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> <i>ADIPOQ</i> SNPs and haplotypes affect BP control in hypertensive patients undergoing treatment.
