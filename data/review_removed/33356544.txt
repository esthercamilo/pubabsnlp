MirSNPs in clopidogrel metabolism genes predict cardiovascular disease risk: a case-control study and meta-analysis.
<b>Aim:</b> The present study was conducted to decipher the inter-relationship of SNPs and miRNAs involved in pharmacogenomics of clopidogrel on predisposition to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). <b>Materials & methods:</b> A case-control study was conducted on 410 cases and 386 controls to analyze the association of 13 mirSNPs on CVDs risk. Genotyping was performed by tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system PCR and validated using Sanger DNA sequencing. miRNA expression analysis was performed using TaqMan assays. A meta-analysis was performed for <i>PON1</i> rs662 with coronary artery disease. <b>Results &Â conclusion:</b><i>PON1</i> rs662, <i>PON1</i> rs3917577, <i>CYP3A5</i> rs15524, <i>COL4A1</i> rs874204 and <i>PTGIR</i> rs1126510 polymorphisms showed association with CVDs. The miRNA hsa-miR-224-5p showed differential expression in the <i>PON1</i> rs3917577 GG genotype. The meta-analysis showed the population-specific impact of <i>PON1</i> rs662 on South Asian and Middle East populations.
