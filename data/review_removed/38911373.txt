Spatial and Single-Cell Investigations Illuminate Theragnostic value and Immune Landscape of Mitochondrial Dynamin-Like GTPase in Breast Cancer.
<b>Background:</b> As we delve into the intricate world of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins, particularly Optic Atrophy types 1 and 3 (OPA1/3), we uncover their pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial dynamic equilibrium and fusion, crucial for cellular energy production and synthesis. Despite extensive scrutiny, the significance of OPA1/3 in breast cancer (BRCA) and its interplay with the immune microenvironment remain elusive. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We meticulously sourced BRCA data from renowned repositories such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), leveraging cutting-edge techniques including single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and pharmacogenomics. Through multifaceted data analysis, we endeavored to unravel the intricate role and potential value of OPA1/3 in BRCA tumorigenesis and progression. <b>Results:</b> Our investigation reveals a conspicuous upregulation of OPA1/3 expression in BRCA, correlating with dismal prognoses. Kaplan-Meier plot analysis underscores that heightened OPA1/3 levels are associated with poor survival rates. Both clinical specimens and biobank biopsies corroborate the elevated expression of OPA1/3 in breast cancer patients. Moreover, scRNA-seq unveils a strong correlation between OPA1/3 and macrophage infiltration in the BRCA immune milieu, alongside its association with the cellular communication network involving CXCL, TGFb, VEGF, and IL16. <b>Conclusion:</b> In light of these findings, OPA1/3 emerges as a promising contender for therapeutic targeting and as a potential diagnostic, prognostic, and survival biomarker in BRCA. The implications of our study underscore the pressing need to explore these novel biomarkers to enhance patient outcomes.
