Pharmacogenetics of antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia.
Antipsychotics are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia. There is large variability between individuals in their response to antipsychotics, both in efficacy and adverse effects of treatment. While the source of interindividual variability in antipsychotic response is not completely understood, genetics is a major contributing factor. The identification of pharmacogenetic markers that predict antipsychotic efficacy and adverse reactions is a growing area of research, and holds the potential to replace the current trial-and-error approach to treatment selection in schizophrenia with a personalized medicine approach.In this chapter, we provide an overview of the current state of pharmacogenetics in schizophrenia treatment. The most promising pharmacogenetic findings are presented for both antipsychotic response and commonly studied adverse reactions. The application of pharmacogenetics to schizophrenia treatment is discussed, with an emphasis on the clinical utility of pharmacogenetic testing and directions for future research.
