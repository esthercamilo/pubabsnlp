Perception and knowledge of pharmacogenetics among Brazilian psychiatrists.
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) can optimize drug therapy in psychiatry and is particularly important in admixed populations. Here we developed and successfully validated a questionnaire for assessing the perception and knowledge of PGx among Brazilian psychiatrists. Overall, the participants showed some familiarity with PGx. Most psychiatrists reported to have knowledge of PGx and recognized its usefulness in psychiatry; however, they declared concerns regarding PGx education, the request of tests and their interpretation, cost-effectiveness, and ethical issues. PGx testing is relatively prevalent in their clinical practice, but education on the topic is lacking. Bivariate analysis revealed significant associations. Psychiatrists > 40 years of age more frequently had a positive perception of other clinicians' familiarity with PGx. Psychiatrists in private health services showed less self-reported competency in the use of PGx testing. Furthermore, women had better perception of PGx education. The present study adds knowledge about PGx in psychiatry and encourages the development of educational and training resources for PGx to improve its clinical implementation.
