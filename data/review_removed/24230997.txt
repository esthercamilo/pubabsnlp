ALDH5A1 variability in opioid dependent patients could influence response to methadone treatment.
Methadone maintenance treatment is the most widely-used therapy in opioid dependence, but some patients relapse or drop out from treatment. We genotyped a genetic variant in the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase enzyme gene, ALDH5A1, and found that subjects carrying the T variant allele have a higher risk to be nonresponders to methadone treatment (OR=3.16; 95% CI [1.48-6.73], P=0.0024). This could be due to a reduction in the ALDH5A1 enzyme activity, that would increase endogenous gamma-hydroxbutyric acid (GHB) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels and therefore, inducing symptoms such as sedation and impaired pschomotor performance. These neuropsychological effects related with the reduction in enzyme activity could be responsible for a higher propensity to relapse in these genetically predisposed patients.
