Interactions among Genetic Background, Anesthetic Agent, and Oxygen Concentration Shape Blunt Traumatic Brain Injury Outcomes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.
Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), the time window during which secondary injuries develop provides a window for therapeutic interventions. During this time, many TBI victims undergo exposure to hyperoxia and anesthetics. We investigated the effects of genetic background on the interaction of oxygen and volatile general anesthetics with brain pathophysiology after closed-head TBI in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. To test whether sevoflurane shares genetic risk factors for mortality with isoflurane and whether locomotion is affected similarly to mortality, we used a device that generates acceleration-deceleration forces to induce TBI in ten inbred fly lines. After TBI, we exposed flies to hyperoxia alone or in combination with isoflurane or sevoflurane and quantified mortality and locomotion 24 and 48 h after TBI. Modulation of TBI-induced mortality and locomotor impairment by hyperoxia with or without anesthetics varied among fly strains and among combinations of agents. Resistance to increased mortality from hyperoxic isoflurane predicted resistance to increased mortality from hyperoxic sevoflurane but did not predict the degree of locomotion impairment under any condition. These findings are important because they demonstrate that, in the context of TBI, genetic background determines the latent toxic potentials of oxygen and anesthetics.
