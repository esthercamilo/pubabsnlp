Opportunity for pharmacogenetics testing in patients with sickle cell anemia.
<b>Background:</b> Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) are exposed to numerous drugs over their lifespan, and many of these drugs have Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines for personalized dosing. The authors' aim was to ascertain the number of drugs with CPIC guidelines prescribed to SCD patients. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A search of Indiana University Health affiliated hospitals' electronic medical record identified 957 patients with a diagnosis of SCD. Drugs or drug classes with CPIC actionable guidelines ordered as inpatient and outpatient prescriptions were collected from SCD patients. <b>Results:</b> During the 16-year period, 892 (93%) patients received at least one drug that could have been dosed according to CPIC guidelines. <b>Conclusion:</b> Preemptive pharmacogenetics testing should be considered in SCD patients in order to utilize these data throughout the patient's life.
