Frequency of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms influencing the warfarin pharmacogenetics in Slovak population.
Warfarin represents the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulants, which functions as an antagonist of vitamin K, an essential factor of blood coagulation cascade. Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index. An insufficient dose can cause failure of antithrombotic effect, and an overdose increases a risk of bleeding. It is known that variability in two genes (CYP2C9 and VKORC1) has a significant effect on individual response to warfarin dose. These polymorphisms influence more than one-third of known warfarin dose effect. Pharmacogenetics of warfarin is less affected by polymorphisms in the other genes such as CYP4F2, CYP2C19, and GGCX.
