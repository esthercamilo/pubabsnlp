Cyrius: accurate CYP2D6 genotyping using whole-genome sequencing data.
Responsible for the metabolism of ~21% of clinically used drugs, CYP2D6 is a critical component of personalized medicine initiatives. Genotyping CYP2D6 is challenging due to sequence similarity with its pseudogene paralog CYP2D7 and a high number and variety of common structural variants (SVs). Here we describe a novel bioinformatics method, Cyrius, that accurately genotypes CYP2D6 using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. We show that Cyrius has superior performance (96.5% concordance with truth genotypes) compared to existing methods (84-86.8%). After implementing the improvements identified from the comparison against the truth data, Cyrius's accuracy has since been improved to 99.3%. Using Cyrius, we built a haplotype frequency database from 2504 ethnically diverse samples and estimate that SV-containing star alleles are more frequent than previously reported. Cyrius will be an important tool to incorporate pharmacogenomics in WGS-based precision medicine initiatives.
