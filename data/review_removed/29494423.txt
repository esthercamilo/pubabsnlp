Warfarin Dosing According to the Genotype-guided Algorithm is Most Beneficial in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Randomized Parallel Group Trial.
Observational studies have indicated potential benefits of CYP2C9- and VKORC1-guided dosing of warfarin but randomized clinical trials have resulted in contradictory findings. One of the reasons for contradiction may be the negligence of possible differences between warfarin indications. This study aims to determine efficacy and safety of genotype-guided and clinically guided dosing of warfarin in atrial fibrillation (AF), deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE) within the first 5 days after the introduction of therapy.
