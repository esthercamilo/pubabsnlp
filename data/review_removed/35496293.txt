Sub-Analysis of CYP-GUIDES Data: Assessing the Prevalence and Impact of Drug-Gene Interactions in an Ethnically Diverse Cohort of Depressed Individuals.
<b>Introduction:</b> Minority groups are underrepresented in pharmacogenomics (PGx) research. Recent sub-analysis of CYP-GUIDES showed reduced length of stay (LOS) in depressed patients with CYP2D6 sub-functional status. Our primary objective was to determine whether PGx guided (G) versus standard treatment (S) influenced LOS among different race/ethnic groups. Secondary objectives included prevalence of drug-gene interactions (DGIs) and readmission rates (RAR). <b>Methods:</b> Retrospective sub-analysis of CYP-GUIDES data comprising CYP2D6 phenotypes was reclassified using standardized CYP2D6 genotype to phenotype recommendations from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG). The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine differences in LOS between groups G and S and Kruskal Wallis test to compare LOS among different race/ethnic groups. Logistic regression was used to determine covariates associated with RAR. <b>Results:</b> This study included 1,459 patients with 67.3% in G group (<i>n</i> = 982). The majority of patients were White (57.5%), followed by Latinos (25.6%) and Blacks (12.3%). Although there were no differences in LOS between G and S groups, Latinos had significant shorter LOS than Whites (<i>p</i> = 0.002). LOS was significantly reduced by 5.6Â days in poor metabolizers in group G compared to S (<i>p</i> = 0.002). The proportion of supra functional and ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs) were 6 and 20.3% using CYP-GUIDES and CPIC/DPWG definitions, respectively. Prevalence of DGIs was 40% with significantly fewer DGIs in Blacks (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Race/ethnicity was significantly associated with RAR (aOR 1.30; <i>p</i> = 0.003). <b>Conclusion:</b> A greater number of patients were classified as CYP2D6 UMs using CPIC/DPWG definitions as compared to CYP-GUIDES definitions. This finding may have clinical implications for using psychotropics metabolized by CYP2D6.
