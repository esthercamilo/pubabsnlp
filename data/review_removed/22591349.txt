The SmartAmp method: rapid detection of SNPs in thiopurine S-methyltransferase and ABC transporters ABCC4 and ABCG2.
Genetic polymorphisms of drug transporters as well as drug metabolizing enzymes have been documented to play a significant role in patients' responses to medication. A key requirement for advancing personalized medicine is the ability to rapidly and conveniently test for patients' genetic polymorphisms. We have recently developed a rapid and cost-effective method for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection, named Smart Amplification Process (SmartAmp), which enables us to detect genetic polymorphisms or mutations in 30 to 45 min under isothermal conditions without the need for DNA isolation and PCR amplification. This article presents the SmartAmp-based detection of SNPs in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene as well as in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCC4 and ABCG2 genes that are critically involved in drug-induced adverse reactions. The SmartAmp method is expected to provide a practical and cost-effective tool for pharmacogenomics-based personalized medicine.
