Relevance of <i>CYP2D6</i> Gene Variants in Population Genetic Differentiation.
A significant portion of the variability in complex features, such as drug response, is likely caused by human genetic diversity. One of the highly polymorphic pharmacogenes is <i>CYP2D6</i>, encoding an enzyme involved in the metabolism of about 25% of commonly prescribed drugs. In a directed search of the 1000 Genomes Phase III variation data, 86 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <i>CYP2D6</i> gene were extracted from the genotypes of 2504 individuals from 26 populations, and then used to reconstruct haplotypes. Analyses were performed using Haploview, Phase, and Arlequin softwares. Haplotype and nucleotide diversity were high in all populations, but highest in populations of African ancestry. Pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> showed significant results for eleven SNPs, six of which were characteristic of African populations, while four SNPs were most common in East Asian populations. A principal component analysis of <i>CYP2D6</i> haplotypes showed that African populations form one cluster, Asian populations form another cluster with East and South Asian populations separated, while European populations form the third cluster. Linkage disequilibrium showed that all African populations have three or more haplotype blocks within the <i>CYP2D6</i> gene, while other world populations have one, except for Chinese Dai and Punjabi in Pakistan populations, which have two.
