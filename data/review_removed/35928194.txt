Personalised future prescribing using pharmacogenomics: A resum√© of a joint Royal College of Physicians / British Pharmacological Society working party report.
There is rapidly growing recognition of the important contribution of individually carried genetic factors to drug response variation (pharmacogenomics) for an increasingly wide range of drugs and of the resulting implications for healthcare across multiple specialisms. This concise overview of the March 2022 joint report of the Royal College of Physicians and the British Pharmacological Society on this topic outlines its coverage of aspects of scientific rationale (with examples), the so far largely unmet need for planned, systematic implementation and training within the UK NHS, and the key forward strategies required. They include a centrally funded, well defined developmental service design with implementation priorities, clinical decision support, clear clinical governance and ongoing research, public and patient engagement, and agreed, updated education and training packages.
