Efflux and uptake transporters as determinants of statin response.
The important role of drug transporters in drug absorption and disposition has been well documented. Statins are subjected to active transport of membrane proteins of the superfamilies ATP-binding cassette and solute carrier, and there is limited understanding of the mechanisms by which differences in transporter expression and activity contributes to variability of pharmacokinetics (PKs)/pharmacodynamics (PDs) of statins.
