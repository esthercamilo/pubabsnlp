Evidence-based pharmacogenetics: Is it possible?
For improving quality, safety and efficiency of care, health systems perform a paradigm change towards personalized medicine, also referred to as genomic medicine. It uses combined knowledge (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) about a person to predict disease susceptibility, disease prognosis or treatment response and thereby to improve the person's health. The last decade has witnessed a steady embrace of personalized medicine by senior government officials, industry leadership and health care providers [1]. On the 12th December of 2013 Russian President Vladimir Putin in his annual address to the Federal Assembly said: "The Ministry of Health and the Russian Academy of Sciences must give priority to fundamental and applied research in medicine, including genomic studies" [2]. A year earlier, in 2012 the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, headed by Veronika Skvortsova established the strategy of personalized medicine development in Russia [3]. But still a lot of work is focused on using clinical research findings to aid the delivery of optimum clinical care to patients. Pharmacogenetic testing (using genetic information to guide drug therapy) is an actively developing field of personalized medicine and its current state indicates that it can be usefully introduced into clinical practice in the nearest future. In Russia pharmacogenetic testing is already used for personalizing prescription of certain drugs [4].
