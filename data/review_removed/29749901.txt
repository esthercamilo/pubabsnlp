UK Pharmacogenetics and Stratified Medicine Network.
The UK Pharmacogenetics and Stratified Medicine Network is a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to bringing together groups of academics, clinicians, industry partners, and regulators with patient representatives to support the implementation pathway of stratified/precision/personalized/P4 medicine into the clinic to deliver improvements in drug delivery. Our collaborators database provides unique opportunities for members to engage with colleagues across all sectors of the stratified medicine landscape to promote their activities. Open meetings highlight research findings and the developments in stratified medicine. Focused workshops invite key experts to debate topics of interest and address the challenges of the whole pathway which will eventually lead to the wider adoption of stratified medicine. The website provides comprehensive information including latest news events, funding and education opportunities.
