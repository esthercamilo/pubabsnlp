[Valproic acid pharmacogenetics in an individual approach to treatment of women of childbearing age with epilepsy].
A clinical case of the development of undesirable pharmacological phenomena in a woman of childbearing age with epilepsy is described. The development of undesirable pharmacological phenomena at reception of average therapeutic doses of valproic acid has been caused by the primary (idiopathic) and secondary (valproate-induced) infringement of a folic cycle against a combination of CYP2C9*3 gene polymorphism and a mutation in the MTHFR gene.
