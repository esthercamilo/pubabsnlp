Genetic Polymorphism of Drug Metabolic Gene <i>CYPs, VKORC1, NAT2, DPYD</i> and <i>CHST3</i> of Five Ethnic Minorities in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China.
Genetic variability in genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes may contribute to the heterogeneity of drug responses in different populations. Extensive research in pharmacogenomics in major populations around the world provides us with a great deal of information about drug-related genetic polymorphisms.
