Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative<sup>®</sup>: a prospective study of the utility of personalized medicine.
There is a dearth of large prospective studies to determine if genetic risk factors are useful predictors of health outcomes and if reporting them to individuals or physicians changes health behavior. The Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative<sup>®</sup> (CPMC, NJ, USA) is a prospective observational study with three cohorts - community, cancer and chronic disease cohorts. Participants provide detailed medical history through a dynamic internet-based portal. DNA is tested and personalized risk reports are provided for potentially actionable health conditions. To date, the community cohort has enrolled 4372 participants. The internet-based portal supplies educational content, captures phenotypic data and delivers customized risk reports. The Informed Cohort Oversight Board has approved 16 health conditions to date, and risk reports with genetic and nongenetic risks for six conditions have been released. The majority (87%) of participants who completed requisite questionnaires viewed at least one report. The CPMC is a cohort study delivering customized risk reports for actionable conditions using a web interface and measuring outcomes longitudinally.
