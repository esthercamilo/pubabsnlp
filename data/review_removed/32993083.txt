Clinical and Laboratory Associations with Methotrexate Metabolism Gene Polymorphisms in Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that causes loss of joint function and significantly reduces quality of life. Plasma metabolite concentrations of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can influence treatment efficacy and toxicity. This study explored the relationship between DMARD-metabolising gene variants and plasma metabolite levels in RA patients. DMARD metabolite concentrations were determined by tandem mass-spectrometry in plasma samples from 100 RA patients with actively flaring disease collected at two intervals. Taqman probes were used to discriminate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes in cohort genomic DNA: rs246240 (<i>ABCC1</i>), rs1476413 (<i>MTHFR</i>), rs2231142 (<i>ABCG2</i>), rs3740065 (<i>ABCC2</i>), rs4149081 (<i>SLCO1B1</i>), rs4846051 (<i>MTHFR</i>), rs10280623 (<i>ABCB1</i>), rs16853826 (<i>ATIC</i>), rs17421511 (<i>MTHFR</i>) and rs717620 (<i>ABCC2</i>). Mean plasma concentrations of methotrexate (MTX) and MTX-7-OH metabolites were higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) at baseline in rs4149081 GA genotype patients. Patients with rs1476413 SNP TT or CT alleles have significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.001) plasma poly-glutamate metabolites at both study time points and correspondingly elevated disease activity scores. Patients with the rs17421511 SNP AA allele reported significantly lower pain scores (<i>p</i> < 0.05) at both study intervals. Genotyping strategies could help prioritise treatments to RA patients most likely to gain clinical benefit whilst minimizing toxicity.
