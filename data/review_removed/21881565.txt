Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) gene variants are not associated with clopidogrel response.
A common functional variant in paraoxonase 1 (PON1), Q192R, was recently reported to be a major determinant of clopidogrel response. This variant was genotyped in 566 participants of the Amish Pharmacogenomics of Anti-Platelet Intervention (PAPI) study and in 227 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients. Serum paraoxonase activity was measured in a subset of 79 PAPI participants. PON1 Q192R was not associated with pre- or post-clopidogrel platelet aggregation in the PAPI study (P = 0.16 and P = 0.21, respectively) or the PCI cohort (P = 0.47 and P = 0.91, respectively). The Q192 allele was not associated with cardiovascular events (hazard ratio (HR) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20-1.06; P = 0.07). No correlation was observed between paraoxonase activity and post-clopidogrel platelet aggregation (r(2) < 0.01, P = 0.78). None of 49 additional PON1 variants evaluated was associated with post-clopidogrel platelet aggregation. These findings do not support a role for PON1 as a determinant of clopidogrel response.
