Implementing Pharmacogenetic Testing in Gastrointestinal Cancers (IMPACT-GI): Study Protocol for a Pragmatic Implementation Trial for Establishing <i>DPYD</i> and <i>UGT1A1</i> Screening to Guide Chemotherapy Dosing.
Fluoropyrimidines (fluorouracil [5-FU], capecitabine) and irinotecan are commonly prescribed chemotherapy agents for gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing for germline <i>DPYD</i> and <i>UGT1A1</i> variants associated with reduced enzyme activity holds the potential to identify patients at high risk for severe chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Slow adoption of PGx testing in routine clinical care is due to implementation barriers, including long test turnaround times, lack of integration in the electronic health record (EHR), and ambiguity in test cost coverage. We sought to establish PGx testing in our health system following the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework as a guide. Our implementation study aims to address barriers to PGx testing.
