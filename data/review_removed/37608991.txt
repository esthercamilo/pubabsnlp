Case report: application of pharmacogenetics in the personalized treatment of an elderly patient with a major depressive episode.
Pharmacogenetic analyses can predict interpersonal differences in response to psychopharmacotherapy, which greatly facilitates the selection of the most effective medication at optimal doses. By personalizing therapy in this way, we can minimize adverse drug reactions (ADR) and prevent polypharmacy. Most psychotropic medications are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYPA3A4, which influence drug metabolism and concentration, affecting both efficacy and the occurrence of ADR. The relationships between genetic variations and enzymatic activity allow pharmacogenetic analysis to provide important data for optimal drug selection. The following case report illustrates the impact of pharmacogenetic analysis on the course of pharmacologic treatment in an elderly patient with a major depressive episode.
