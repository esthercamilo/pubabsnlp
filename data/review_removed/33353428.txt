Catalyzing clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine interventions in Africa.
Pharmacogenomics is considered to be the low-hanging fruit in the tree of genomic medicine with numerous examples of its successful implementation in the clinic. In this perspective, we provide details about the potential clinical application of pharmacogenomics in African populations by using relevant drug cases and high-throughput genomics approaches; involving numerous countries and stakeholders; and most importantly exploiting the existing knowledge of respective large-scale initiatives. We emphasize on the necessity of constructing appropriate frameworks for government policies in African countries. We also provide input about different initiatives in the field of genomics medicine implementation in Africa, not only for their potential for synergy and collaboration among them, but also as models for replication in other regions worldwide, aiming for healthcare improvement.
