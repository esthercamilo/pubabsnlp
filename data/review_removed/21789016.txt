Pharmacogenetics of escitalopram and mental adaptation to cancer in palliative care: report of 18 cases.
In palliative care, few data are available on the diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders and of difficulties of mental adaptation to cancer for patients in the advanced phases of the disease. SSRI antidepressants are the treatment of choice; the 5-HTTLPR genetic polymorphism of the serotonin transporter (SERT) has been shown in psychiatry to significantly determine the therapeutic response and the incidence of adverse effects. The aim of the present investigation has been therefore to examine the effects of the SSRI antidepressant escitalopram, also considering 5-HTTLPR, on depression, anxiety and mental adaptation to cancer in palliative care.
