A multi-center interventional study to assess pharmacokinetics, effectiveness, and tolerability of prolonged-release tacrolimus after pediatric kidney transplantation: study protocol for a prospective, open-label, randomized, two-phase, two-sequence, single dose, crossover, phase III b trial.
Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), is currently the first-line immunosuppressive agent in kidney transplantation. The therapeutic index of tacrolimus is narrow due to due to the substantial impact of minor variations in drug concentration or exposure on clinical outcomes (i.e., nephrotoxicity), and it has a highly variable intra- and inter-individual bioavailability. Non-adherence to immunosuppressants is associated with rejection after kidney transplantation, which is the main cause of long-term graft loss. Once-daily formulations have been shown to significantly improve adherence compared to twice-daily dosing. Envarsus<sup>®</sup>, the once-daily prolonged-release formulation of tacrolimus, offers the same therapeutic efficacy as the conventional twice-daily immediate-release tacrolimus formulation (Prograf<sup>®</sup>) with improved bioavailability, a more consistent pharmacokinetic profile, and a reduced peak to trough, which may reduce CNI-related toxicity. Envarsus<sup>®</sup> has been approved as an immunosuppressive therapy in adults following kidney or liver transplantation but has not yet been approved in children. The objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy, and tolerability of Envarsus<sup>®</sup> in children and adolescents aged ≥ 8 and ≤ 18 years to assess its potential role as an additional option for immunosuppressive therapy in children after kidney transplantation.
