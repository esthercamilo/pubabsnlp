Delineating significant genome-wide associations of variants with antipsychotic and antidepressant treatment response: implications for clinical pharmacogenomics.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have significantly contributed to the association of many clinical conditions and phenotypic characteristics with genomic variants. The majority of these genomic findings have been deposited to the GWAS catalog. So far, findings uncovering associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with treatment efficacy in mood disorders are encouraging, but not adequate.
