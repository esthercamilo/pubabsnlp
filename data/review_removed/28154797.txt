Sex-specific effects of serum sulfate level and <i>SLC13A1</i> nonsense variants on DHEA homeostasis.
Sulfate is critical in the biotransformation of multiple compounds via sulfation. These compounds include neurotransmitters, proteoglycans, xenobiotics, and hormones such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Sulfation reactions are thought to be rate-limited by endogenous sulfate concentrations. The gene, <i>SLC13A1</i>, encodes the sodium-sulfate cotransporter NaS1, responsible for sulfate (re)absorption in the intestines and kidneys. We previously reported two rare, non-linked, nonsense variants in <i>SLC13A1</i> (R12X and W48X) associated with hyposulfatemia (<i>P</i> = 9 × 10<sup>- 20</sup>).
