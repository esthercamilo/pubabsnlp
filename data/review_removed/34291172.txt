On the path towards personalized medicine: Implications of pharmacogenetic studies of alcohol use disorder medications.
The heritability of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is estimated to be ~50%; however, the genetic basis of the disease is still poorly understood. The genetic variants identified thus far only explain a small percentage of AUD phenotypic variability. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are impacted by technical and methodological limitations, genetic variants that have been identified independently of GWAS findings can moderate the efficacy of AUD medications.
