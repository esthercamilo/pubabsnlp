<i>TRIB3</i> rs6037475 is a potential biomarker for predicting felodipine drug response in Chinese patients with hypertension.
Our previous studies have found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of <i>tribbles homolog 3</i> (<i>TRIB3</i>) are related to the hypotensive effects of calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In this study, we aimed at exploring and validating the effect of <i>TRIB3</i> polymorphism on antihypertensive drugs responses.
