Pharmacogenetics of Complement Factor H Y402H Polymorphism and Treatment of Neovascular AMD with Anti-VEGF Agents: A Meta-Analysis.
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the Y402H polymorphism (rs1061170, a T-to-C transition at amino acid position 402) in the complement factor H (CFH) gene have a pharmacogenetics effect on the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We performed a meta-analysis using databases including PubMed and EMBASE to find relevant studies. 13 published association studies were selected for this meta-analysis, including 2704 patients. For the CFH Y402H polymorphism, anti-VEGF treatment was much less effective in AMD patients with the CFH CC genotype (CC versus TT: odds ratio (OR)â€‰= 55, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31 to 0.95, P = 0.03; CC versus CT: OR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.91, P = 0.02; and CC versus CT + TT: OR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.90, P = 0.02, respectively). In subgroup analysis, CFH Y402H polymorphism was more likely to be a predictor of response for Caucasians (CC versus CT+TT: OR = 0.63, 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.95, P = 0.03). In conclusion, pharmacogenetics of CFH Y402H polymorphism may play a role in response to anti-VEGF treatment for neovascular AMD, especially for Caucasians.
