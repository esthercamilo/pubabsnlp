Cost-utility analysis of pharmacogenomics-guided tacrolimus treatment in Austrian kidney transplant recipients participating in the U-PGx PREPARE study.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health issue. Kidney failure patients may undergo a kidney transplantation (KTX) and prescribed an immunosuppressant medication i.e., tacrolimus. Tacrolimus' efficacy and toxicity varies among patients. This study investigates the cost-utility of pharmacogenomics (PGx) guided tacrolimus treatment compared to the conventional approach in Austrian patients undergone KTX, participating in the PREPARE UPGx study. Treatment's effectiveness was determined by mean survival, and utility values were based on a Visual Analog Scale score. Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio was also calculated. PGx-guided treatment arm was found to be cost-effective, resulting in reduced cost (3902 euros less), 6% less hospitalization days and lower risk of adverse drug events compared to the control arm. The PGx-guided arm showed a mean 0.900 QALYs (95% CI: 0.862-0.936) versus 0.851 QALYs (95% CI: 0.814-0.885) in the other arm. In conclusion, PGx-guided tacrolimus treatment represents a cost-saving option in the Austrian healthcare setting.
