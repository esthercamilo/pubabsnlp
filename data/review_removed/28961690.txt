ncDR: a comprehensive resource of non-coding RNAs involved in drug resistance.
As a promising field of individualized therapy, non-coding RNA pharmacogenomics promotes the understanding of different individual responses to certain drugs and acts as a reasonable reference for clinical treatment. However, relevant information is scattered across the published literature, which is inconvenient for researchers to explore non-coding RNAs that are involved in drug resistance. To address this, we systemically identified validated and predicted drug resistance-associated microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs through manual curation and computational analysis. Subsequently, we constructed an omnibus repository named ncDR, which furnishes a user-friendly interface that allows for convenient browsing, visualization, querying and downloading of data. Given the rapidly increasing interest in precision medicine, ncDR will significantly improve our understanding of the roles of regulatory non-coding RNAs in drug resistance and has the potential to be a timely and valuable resource.
