Global distribution of functionally important CYP2C9 alleles and their inferred metabolic consequences.
Genetic variability in the cytochrome P450 CYP2C9 constitutes an important predictor for efficacy and safety of various commonly prescribed drugs, including coumarin anticoagulants, phenytoin and multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A global map of CYP2C9 variability and its inferred functional consequences has been lacking.
