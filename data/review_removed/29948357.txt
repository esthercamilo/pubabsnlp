Phase II study of DFP-10917, a deoxycytidine analog, given by 14-day continuous intravenous infusion for chemotherapy-refractory advanced colorectal cancer.
Background DFP-10917 is a cytotoxic deoxycytidine analogue that causes DNA fragmentation, G<sub>2</sub>/M-phase arrest, and apoptosis. This agent has been shown to have antitumor activity against colorectal cancer (CRC) in preclinical studies and to be tolerable in patients. The purpose of our phase II trial was to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacogenomics of DFP-10917 as well as DNA damage studies in patients with advanced CRC refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Methods In this single-arm, Simon two-stage, phase II trial, patients with chemotherapy-refractory advanced CRC received 2.0 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day DFP-10917 via 14-day continuous infusion. Enrollment criteria included age ≥ 18 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0 or 1, and adequate organ function. The primary endpoint was 3-month progression-free survival, defined as the proportion of patients who did not have progressive disease or death within 3 months of starting therapy. All patients who received any amount of DFP-10917 were included in the safety analysis. DNA damage study was assessed by comet assay. Results Of 28 patients initially enrolled, 26 received DFP-10917. Three patients (12%) were progression free at 3 months. The median progression-free survival was 1.3 months (95% confidence interval, 1.3-1.6 months). There were no complete or partial responses. Most patients (n = 20, 77%) had progressive disease, and only six (23%) had stable disease at any time. The trial was terminated according to the pre-planned stopping rule. The most frequent (≥5%) medication-related grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (n = 10, 38%), fatigue (n = 4, 15%), anemia (n = 3, 12%), and leukopenia (n = 3, 12%). DNA strand-breaks were detected after infusion (medians of % tail intensity were 2.89 and 12.64 on day 1 and day 15, respectively, p < 0.001, sign test). Conclusion Overall, single-agent DFP-10917 did not show meaningful antitumor activity in chemotherapy-refractory advanced CRC. The safety profile of DFP-10917 was tolerable and similar to that observed in earlier clinical studies.
