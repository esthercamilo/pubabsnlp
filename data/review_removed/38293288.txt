The atorvastatin metabolite pattern in muscle tissue and blood plasma is associated with statin muscle side effects in patients with coronary heart disease; An exploratory case-control study.
Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) is a prevalent cause of statin discontinuation. It is challenging and time-consuming for clinicians to assess whether symptoms are caused by the statin or not, and diagnostic biomarkers are requested. Atorvastatin metabolites have been associated with SAMS. We aimed to compare atorvastatin pharmacokinetics between coronary heart disease (CHD) patients with and without clinically statin intolerance and statin-dependent histopathological alterations in muscle tissue. Secondarily we aimed to assess genetic variants relevant for the observed pharmacokinetic variables.
