Pharmacogenetic score predicts overall survival, progression-free survival and platinum sensitivity in ovarian cancer.
<b>Aim:</b> To define the impact of polymorphisms in genes involved in platinum-taxane and estrogen activity in the outcome of platinum-based treated ovarian cancer patients (OCP). <b>Patients & Methods:</b> Two hundred and thirty OCP were analyzed for 124 germ-line polymorphisms to generate a prognostic score for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and platinum-free interval (PFI). <b>Results:</b><i>ABCG2</i> rs3219191D>I, <i>UGT1A</i> rs10929302G>A and <i>UGT1A</i> rs2741045T>C polymorphisms were significantly associated with all three parameters (OS, PFS and PFI) and were used to generate a score. Patients in high-risk group had a poorer OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3-2.7; p = 0.0019), PFS (HR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.4-2.9; p < 0.0001) and PFI (HR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4-2.8; p = 0.0002) compared with those in low-risk group. <b>Conclusion:</b> The prognostic-score including polymorphisms involved in drug and estrogen pathways stratifies OCP according to OS, PFS and PFI.
