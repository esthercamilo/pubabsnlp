Verification of pharmacogenomics-based algorithms to predict warfarin maintenance dose using registered data of Japanese patients.
Large inter-individual differences in warfarin maintenance dose are mostly due to the effect of genetic polymorphisms in multiple genes, including vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1), cytochromes P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), and cytochrome P450 4F2 (CYP4F2). Thus, several algorithms for predicting the warfarin dose based on pharmacogenomics data with clinical characteristics have been proposed. Although these algorithms consider these genetic polymorphisms, the formulas have different coefficient values that are critical in this context. In this study, we assessed the mutual validity among these algorithms by specifically considering racial differences.
