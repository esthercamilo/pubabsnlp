Pharmacogenetic variation of <i>SLC47A1</i> gene and metformin response in type2 diabetes patients.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a worldwide epidemic disorder with considerable health and economic consequences. Metformin is one of the most commonly prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs. Pharmacogenetic studies showed that variants in genes related to the pharmacokinetics of metformin were associated with glucose-lowering effect of metformin. The aim of this study was to evaluate pharmacogenetic variation in <i>SLC47A1</i> (rs2289669) and metformin response in type 2 diabetes patients. Seventy one patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the study. The genotypes were determined by Tetra-ARMS-PCR method. There was a significant association between the study polymorphism and the response to metformin treatment with the highest HbA1C reduction in AG genotype. In the dominant model for A allele (AA+AG <i>vs</i> GG), patients with A allele had highest HbA1C reduction in response to metformin.
