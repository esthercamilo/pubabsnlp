Clinical and Genetic Predictors of Glycemic Control and Weight Loss Response to Liraglutide in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.
Background: Evidence suggests a heterogeneous response to therapy with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study is to identify the genetic and clinical factors that relate to glycemic control and weight loss response to liraglutide among patients with T2DM. Methods: The medical records of 116 adults with T2DM (51% female, mean body mass index 35.4 ± 6.4 kg/m2), who had been on treatment with liraglutide for at least 6 months and were genotyped for CTRB1/2 rs7202877 (T > G) polymorphism, were evaluated. Clinical and laboratory parameters were measured at baseline, 3, and 6 months after initiating liraglutide treatment. The good glycemic response was defined as one of the following: (i) achievement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) < 7% (ii) reduction of the baseline HbA1c by ≥1%, and (iii) maintenance of HbA1c < 7% that a patient already had before switching to liraglutide. Weight loss responders were defined as subjects who lost ≥3% of their baseline weight. Results: Minor allele frequency was 16%. Individuals were classified as glycemic control and weight loss responders (81 (70%) and 77 (66%), respectively). Carriers of the rs7202877 polymorphic allele had similar responses to liraglutide treatment in terms of glycemic control (odds ratio (OR): 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4, 3.8, p = 0.69) and weight loss (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.4, 3.2, p = 0.84). In the multivariable analysis, higher baseline HbA1c (adjusted OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.05, 2.1, p = 0.04) and lower baseline weight (adjusted OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94, 0.99, p = 0.01) were associated with better glycemic response to liraglutide, while higher baseline weight was associated with worse weight response (adjusted OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95, 0.99, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Specific patient features can predict glycemic and weight loss response to liraglutide in individuals with T2DM.
