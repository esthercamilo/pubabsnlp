[Pharmacogenetics in Parkinson's disease treatment].
The authors present the current opinion on the significance of molecular biology in individualized therapy. Pharmacogenetics is a new branch of clinical pharmacology dealing with the influence of genetic factors on drugs with special focus on interpersonal differences to drug response. The article includes basic rules of pharmacogenetics as well as its use in clinical practice. Individualized treatment of Parkinson's disease is not widely known although interpersonal differences to drug response is clearly stated. There is some evidence that varied efficacy of treatment and risk of motor and mental complications can be of genetic origin. Some results concerning the relationship between genetic polymorphism of COMT, DRD2, DAT, CCK, MTHFR and successful and safe treatment of Parkinson's disease are presented.
