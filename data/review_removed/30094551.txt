Letrozole concentration is associated with CYP2A6 variation but not with arthralgia in patients with breast cancer.
The aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole is a first-line drug in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Adherence to AI therapy, including letrozole, remains problematic due to the development of debilitating AI-induced arthralgia. Letrozole is metabolized in the liver by CYP2A6. It remains unknown if plasma letrozole levels or CYP2A6 genetic variation is associated with the development of arthralgia.
