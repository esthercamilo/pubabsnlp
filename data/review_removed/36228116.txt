Clinician adherence to pharmacogenomics prescribing recommendations in clinical decision support alerts.
Thoughtful integration of interruptive clinical decision support (CDS) alerts within the electronic health record is essential to guide clinicians on the application of pharmacogenomic results at point of care. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital implemented a preemptive pharmacogenomic testing program in 2011 in a multidisciplinary effort involving extensive education to clinicians about pharmacogenomic implications. We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinicians' adherence to 4783 pharmacogenomically guided CDS alerts that triggered for 12 genes and 60 drugs. Clinicians adhered to the therapeutic recommendations provided in 4392 alerts (92%). In our population of pediatric patients with catastrophic illnesses, the most frequently presented gene/drug CDS alerts were TPMT/NUDT15 and thiopurines (n = 3850), CYP2D6 and ondansetron (n = 667), CYP2D6 and oxycodone (n = 99), G6PD and G6PD high-risk medications (n  = 51), and CYP2C19 and proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole and pantoprazole; n = 50). The high adherence rate was facilitated by our team approach to prescribing and our collaborative CDS design and delivery.
