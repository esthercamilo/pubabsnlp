Interethnic variability of CYP2D6 alleles and of predicted and measured metabolic phenotypes across world populations.
The frequency of CYP2D6 alleles, related to either a lack of or increased enzymatic activity, which may lead to poor metabolism (PM) or ultrarapid metabolism (UM), can vary across ethnic groups and hence across geographic regions.
