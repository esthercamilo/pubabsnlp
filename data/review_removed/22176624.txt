Pharmacogenetics of drug-metabolizing enzymes: the prodrug hypothesis.
The hope of individualized drug therapy has been bolstered by the knowledge that drug-metabolizing enzymes can be affected by genetic polymorphisms. The initial flurry of potential examples has been muted somewhat by the failure of most predictions to be translated into clinical practice. Perhaps the only real example with reasonable evidence is that of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine and thiopurine methyl-transferase. A few other examples such as tamoxifen, clopidogrel, irinotecan and warfarin warrant further discussion. An interesting feature of these drugs is that all except warfarin are prodrugs. We propose the hypothesis that prodrugs are over-represented in drugs that may be affected by genetic polymorphisms. Understanding this may assist our efforts to advance the field.
