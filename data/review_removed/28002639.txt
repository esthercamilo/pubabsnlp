Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for CYP2D6 genotype and use of ondansetron and tropisetron.
5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonists are used in the prevention of chemotherapy- induced, radiation-induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting. <i>CYP2D6</i> polymorphisms can influence the metabolism of some of these drugs (i.e. ondansetron and tropisetron) thereby affecting drug efficacy. We summarize evidence from the published literature supporting these associations and provide therapeutic recommendations for ondansetron and tropisetron based on <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype (updates at www.pharmgkb.org).
