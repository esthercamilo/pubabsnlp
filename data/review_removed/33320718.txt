Recent advances in the personalized treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer with tamoxifen: a focus on pharmacogenomics.
<b>Introduction</b>: Tamoxifen is still an important drug in hormone-dependent breast cancer therapy. Personalization of its clinical use beyond hormone receptor positivity could improve the substantial variability of the treatment response.<b>Areas covered</b>: The overview of the current evidence for the treatment personalization using therapeutic drug monitoring, or using genetic biomarkers including CYP2D6 is provided. Although many studies focused on the PK aspects or the impact of CYP2D6 variability the translation into clinical routine is not clearly defined due to the inconsistent clinical outcome data.<b>Expert opinion</b>: We believe that at least the main candidate factors, i.e. CYP2D6 polymorphism, CYP2D6 inhibition, endoxifen serum levels may become important predictors of clinical relevance for tamoxifen treatment personalization in the future. To achieve this aim, however, further research should take into consideration more precise characterization of the disease, epigenetic factors and also utilize an appropriately powered multifactorial approach instead of a single gene evaluating studies.
