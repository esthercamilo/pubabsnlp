Economic Utility: Combinatorial Pharmacogenomics and Medication Cost Savings for Mental Health Care in a Primary Care Setting.
This study was an analysis based on a previously completed prospective study investigating medication costs of patients with mental illness guided by using the GeneSight proprietary combinatorial pharmacogenomic (PGx) test. The primary objective of this study was to determine potential cost savings of combinatorial PGx testing over the course of 1 year in patients with mental illness treated by primary care providers (PCPs) and psychiatrists who had switched or added a new psychiatric medication after patients failed to respond to monotherapy. The current evaluation details cost savings of treatment decisions congruent and incongruent with the combinatorial PGx test recommendations specific to PCPs and psychiatrists.
