Polymorphisms of 5-HTT LPR and GNβ3 825C>T and Response to Antidepressant Treatment in Functional Dyspepsia: A Study from The Functional Dyspepsia Treatment Trial.
The Functional Dyspepsia Treatment Trial reported that amitriptyline (AMI) was associated with adequate relief of functional dyspepsia (FD) symptoms, but the pharmacogenetics of antidepressant response in FD are not known. GNβ3 825C>T CC genotype has been previously linked to FD and TT genotype to antidepressant response in depression. The ss genotype of the 5-HTT LPR variant of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been linked to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) response. We aimed to examine whether GNβ3 825C>T and 5-HTT LPR polymorphisms result in differential treatment effects in FD patients receiving antidepressant therapy.
