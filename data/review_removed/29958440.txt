Warfarin: The End or the End of One Size Fits All Therapy?
Oral anticoagulants are required for both treatment and prophylaxis in many different diseases. Clinicians and patients now have a choice of oral anticoagulants, including the vitamin K antagonists (of which warfarin is the most widely used and is used as the exemplar in this paper), and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs: dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban). This paper explores the recent advances and controversies in oral anticoagulation. While some commentators may favour a complete switchover to DOACs, this paper argues that warfarin still has a place in therapy, and a stratified approach that enables the correct choice of both drug and dose would improve both patient outcomes and affordability.
