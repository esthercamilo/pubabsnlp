HLA-A*02:01:01/-B*35:01:01/-C*04:01:01 haplotype associated with lamotrigine-induced maculopapular exanthema in Mexican Mestizo patients.
Several HLA alleles have been associated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) in different populations; however, this has not been investigated in Mexican Mestizos (MM). Thus, the purpose of this preliminary study was to determine the association of HLA class I alleles with AED-induced cADRs in MM patients.
