Survey of physicians' views on the clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics-based personalized therapy.
Despite quantitative increases and qualitative advances in pharmacogenomics (PGx) research, the clinical implementation of PGx-based personalized therapy has still been limited. The objective of this study was to assess physicians' self-reported knowledge of PGx-based personalized therapy, and to explore the most problematic and highest priority barriers preventing physicians from applying PGx into clinical practice under the Korean healthcare system. A 36-question survey was distributed to 53 physicians with various specialties in Korea. In the physicians' self-perceived knowledge, twenty-eight physicians (53%) reported a lack sufficient knowledge about PGx. The perceived largest barrier to clinical implementation of PGx was the high cost of PGx testing, followed by a lack of PGx education for healthcare providers or lack of clinical PGx experts. Physicians without clinical PGx experience or with indirect experience reported that the largest barrier to clinical implementation of PGx was the high cost of PGx testing, while physicians with clinical PGx experience pointed out that a lack of patients' education was the major concern, followed by a lack of PGx education for healthcare providers or lack of clinical PGx experts. The highest priority problem was reported to be a lack of actionable guidelines for drug selection and dosing using PGx. In conclusion, we should increase and expand extensive educational programs for healthcare providers and patients, and to develop and establish a clinical decision support systems for PGx-based personalized therapy in Korea.
