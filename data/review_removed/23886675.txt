Genotypic variation in the SV2C gene impacts response to atypical antipsychotics the CATIE study.
Pharmacogenetic (PGx) predictors of response would improve outcomes in antipsychotic treatment. Based on both biological rationale and prior evidence of an impact on Parkinson's disease, we conducted an association study for 106 SNPs in the synaptic vesicle protein 2C (SV2C) gene using genetic and treatment response data from the Clinical Trial of Antipsychotic Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE). We examined response to the atypical antipsychotics for Caucasian subjects in the blinded phases, Phases 1A, 1B, and 2, of CATIE with sample sizes as follows: olanzapine (N=134), quetiapine (N=124), risperidone (N=134), and ziprasidone (N=74). Response was defined as change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score using a mixed model repeat measures approach. Subjects homozygous for the T allele of rs11960832 displayed significantly worse response to olanzapine treatment, the only finding with study-wide significance (p=2.94×10(-5); false discovery rate=2.18×10(-2)). These subjects also displayed worse response to quetiapine with nominal significance (p=4.56×10(-2)). While no other SNP achieved study-wide significance, one SNP (rs10214163) influencing Parkinson's disease displayed nominally significant association with olanzapine and quetiapine response, while the second such SNP (rs30196) showed a statistical trend toward correlating with olanzapine and quetiapine response. Furthermore, both coding SNPs examined (rs31244 and rs2270927) displayed nominally significant correlations with treatment response: one for olanzapine (rs227092), and one for quetiapine (rs31244). The fact that multiple SNPs in SV2C may impact response to atypical antipsychotics suggests that further evaluation of SNPs in this gene as PGx predictors of antipsychotic response is warranted.
