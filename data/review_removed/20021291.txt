Genetic polymorphism of inosine-triphosphate-pyrophosphatase influences mercaptopurine metabolism and toxicity during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia individualized for thiopurine-S-methyl-transferase status.
Although genetic polymorphisms in the gene encoding human thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) are known to have a marked effect on mercaptopurine metabolism and toxicity, there are many patients with wild-type TPMT who develop toxicity. Furthermore, when mercaptopurine dosages are adjusted in patients who are heterozygous at the TPMT locus, there are still some patients who develop toxicity for reasons that are not fully understood. Therefore, we recently studied the effects of a common polymorphism in another gene encoding an enzyme involved in mercaptopurine metabolism (SNP rs1127354 in inosine-triphospate-pyrophosphatase, ITPA), showing that genetic polymorphism of ITPA is a significant determinant of mercaptopurine metabolism and of febrile neutropenia following combination chemotherapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in which mercaptopurine doses are individualized based on TPMT genotype.
