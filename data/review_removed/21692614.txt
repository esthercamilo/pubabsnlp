Pharmacogenetics and individualized therapy in children: immunosuppressants, antidepressants, anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs.
Pharmacogenetic polymorphisms that change the amino acid sequences in coding regions only account for part of the interindividual differences in disease susceptibility and drug response. Additional pharmacogenomic and epigenetic factors are also involved. In children, pharmacogenetic studies are limited, although it has been clear for many years that the interactions between developmental patterns of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters have a major impact on dose exposure with age-specific dosage requirements. This article will analyze the factors affecting variability in drug response in children and focus on the pharmacogenetic polymorphisms of immunosuppressants, antidepressants, anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. Additional pharmacogenetic and epigenetic studies should be performed to allow the individualization of therapy in children.
