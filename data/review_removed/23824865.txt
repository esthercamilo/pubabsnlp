PharmGKB: the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base.
The Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base, PharmGKB, is an interactive tool for researchers investigating how genetic variation affects drug response. The PharmGKB Web site, http://www.pharmgkb.org , displays genotype, molecular, and clinical knowledge integrated into pathway representations and Very Important Pharmacogene (VIP) summaries with links to additional external resources. Users can search and browse the knowledgebase by genes, variants, drugs, diseases, and pathways. Registration is free to the entire research community, but subject to agreement to use for research purposes only and not to redistribute. Registered users can access and download data to aid in the design of future pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics studies.
