Precision medicine: a call for increased pharmacogenomic education.
Precision medicine is an emerging model of care where providers consider patients' genetic profiles, lifestyles and environments to offer more precise therapy. The potential of precision medicine is boundless as interdisciplinary teams utilize genetic technologies to improve patient outcomes.Â The integration of precision medicine into healthcare faces many barriers, including a lack of standardization and reimbursement concerns. This article argues that increased pharmacogenetics education and system-wide implementation is necessary to overcome some of these challenges. Extensive expansion of pharmacogenomics education is a step toward producing knowledgeable clinicians who are poised to apply its methodology and champion for patient-centered care.
