Warfarin-related nephropathy: possible role for the warfarin pharmacogenetic profile.
Warfarin-related nephropathy (WRN) is a renal complication of warfarin treatment associated with over-anticoagulation. We describe a case of a 73-year-old man affected by chronic kidney disease, essential hypertension and atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin. The patient presented a rapid course of kidney failure after many episodes of over-anticoagulation, and renal biopsy demonstrated WRN. Interestingly, the patient's warfarin pharmacogenetic profile showed that he was warfarin sensitive. This is the first report describing the presence of gene polymorphisms affecting warfarin metabolism in a subject with a biopsy-proven WRN. The patient was treated with corticosteroids obtaining a partial clinical response.
