Influence of pharmacogenomic polymorphisms on allopurinol-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions in Thai patients.
Allopurinol has been causing substantial morbidity and mortality particularly in Asian population by producing cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs). Nonetheless, there are no data describing whether other genetics are a valid marker for prediction of allopurinol-induced cADRs patients in addition to HLA-B*58:01 allele. The goal of this study was to identify suitable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for allopurinol induced cADRs among Thai patients.
