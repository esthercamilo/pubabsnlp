Effects and safety evaluation of Wuzhi Capsules combined with tacrolimus for the treatment of kidney transplantation recipients.
Tacrolimus (FK506), an effective and potent calcineurin inhibitor, is the cornerstone of immunosuppression after kidney transplantation. Wuzhi capsule (WZC), a prescribed ethanol extract of Nan-Wuweizi (Schisandra sphenanthera), is widely prescribed for kidney transplant recipients for the maintenance of tacrolimus concentration in clinical settings. Previous studies have demonstrated that WZC can increase the blood concentration of tacrolimus. However, it remains controversial whether to use WZC can be used to increase tacrolimus concentration in clinical practice. Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WZC combined with tacrolimus in the treatment of kidney transplant recipients.
