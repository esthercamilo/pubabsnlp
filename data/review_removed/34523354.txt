Polymorphisms in the <i>CYP3A5</i> gene significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus after kidney transplantation.
<b>Aim:</b> Sirolimus (SIR) is an immunosuppressant with limitations, including a narrow treatment window, multiple adverse reactions and large differences within and among individuals. <b>Objective:</b> The correlation between numerous SNPs and SIR in terms of trough concentration in the early stage after kidney transplantation was analyzed. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A retrospective cohort study involving 69 kidney transplantation recipients was designed. Blood samples were collected to extract total DNAs, and trough SIR concentrations were measured. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between SNPs and SIR trough concentrations. <b>Results:</b> At 7 days, 1 month and 3 months, the mean SIR trough concentration of patients in the <i>CYP3A5</i> rs4646453-CC group was significantly higher than that in the <i>CYP3A5</i> rs4646453-AA and <i>CYP3A5</i> rs4646453-CA groups (p < 0.001) and <i>CYP3A5</i> rs15524-AA group was significantly higher than that in the <i>CYP3A5</i> rs15524-AG and <i>CYP3A5</i> rs15524-GG groups (p < 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study indicated that both <i>CYP3A5</i> rs4646453 and <i>CYP3A5</i> rs15524 had a certain influence on SIR trough concentration at 7 days, 1 month and 3 months.
