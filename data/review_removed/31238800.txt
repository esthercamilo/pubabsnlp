Large-scale <i>PRNP</i> genotyping of small ruminants using an automated high-throughput MALDI-TOF MS assay.
Scrapie resistance or susceptibility in sheep is associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at codons 136, 154, and 171 of the prion protein gene (<i>PRNP</i>). In addition, phenylalanine mutation at codon 141 has been recognized as a risk factor for atypical scrapie. In contrast, K222, D146, and S146 alleles confer genetic resistance to classical scrapie in goats. High-throughput genotyping technologies would provide significant benefits in scrapie eradication plans. The ability to resolve oligonucleotides varying in mass by less than a single nucleotide makes MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) a suitable platform for <i>PRNP</i> genotyping. We evaluated the commercial Myriapod scrapie kit (Diatech Pharmacogenetics), associated with a highly automated processing platform incorporating MALDI-TOF MS technology, to detect SNPs at codons 136, 154, 171, 141, and 222 of small ruminant PRNP. The Myriapod scrapie kit was accredited according to UNI CEI EN ISO/IEC 17025. We present the genotyping results of 10,960 sheep in Sicily and 1,822 goats in Sicily and Calabria (southern Italy) tested during 2017. We found a high frequency (43.9%) of the protective ARR allele in sheep and a promising 12.3% of the resistant K222 variant in goats. This efficient and high-throughput method is suitable for extensive <i>PRNP</i> genotyping, as requested in the European scrapie eradication plan.
