<i>CYP2C19</i> genetic polymorphism in the Vietnamese population.
<b>Background:</b> Genetic polymorphism of <i>CYP2C19</i> has been shown to affect enzyme activity and thereby contribute to inter-individual variability in drug metabolism and response. The complete genetic variation of <i>CYP2C19</i> in Vietnam still remains obscure even though data of common alleles in Vietnamese Kinh have been reported.<b>Aim:</b> To establish the extent of <i>CYP2C19</i> polymorphism in Vietnamese.<b>Subjects and methods:</b> The promoter and all nine exons of <i>CYP2C19</i> in 100 healthy unrelated Vietnamese Kinh subjects were sequenced. Additionally, the <i>CYP2C19</i> variants, *2, *3 and *17 were analysed by RFLP-PCR in 275 subjects of four minor ethnic groups in Vietnam (Tay, Muong, H'Mong and Nung).<b>Results:</b> In 100 Kinh subjects, the percentages of <i>CYP2C19</i>*1, <i>CYP2C19</i>*2, <i>CYP2C19</i>*3 and <i>CYP2C19</i>*17 alleles were 76%, 20.5%, 2.5% and 1%, respectively. Three novel variants in introns 2, 5 and 8 had no impact on mRNA splicing according to the Human Splicing Finder. The prevalence of <i>CYP2C19</i>*17 in Vietnamese Kinh was significantly lower compared with figures found in Western Asia and Europe, while <i>CYP2C19</i>*2 frequency was statistically higher than that in Western Asia and several countries in Europe. The frequency of <i>CYP2C19</i>*2 in Kinh was significantly lower than in the other four ethnic minorities.<b>Conclusion:</b> These results provide information on <i>CYP2C19</i> polymorphism in the Vietnamese population, which could be useful for optimising drug therapies and precision medicine studies.
