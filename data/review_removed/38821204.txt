OPRM1 rs2075572 has potential to affect plasma buprenorphine level in opioid users, but not OPRM1 rs562859.
OPRM1 gene encoding mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is the primary candidate gene for buprenorphine (BUP) pharmacogenetics. OPRM1 undergoes alternative splicing leading to multiple MOR subtypes. Thus, in the current study 2 SNPs (rs1799972 and rs562859) were selected due to evidence for their contribution to alternative splicing of OPRM1. The effects of 2 SNPs of OPRM1 gene on plasma buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine levels in a sample of 233 OUD patients receiving BUP/naloxone were examined. Polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR and RFLP. BUP and norbuprenorphine concentrations in plasma were measured by LC-MS/MS. OPRM1 rs2075572 GC + CC (0.12 ng/ml) had significantly higher plasma BUP level compared to GG (0.084 ng/ml) (p = 0.043). Although there was not a statistically significant difference between OPRM1 rs562859 genotypes (p = 0.46), patients with OPRM1 rs562859 CT + TT had higher plasma BUP and BUP-related values as compared to those with CC. In conclusion, the effect of OPRM1 rs2075572 on BUP levels in opioid users' plasma was shown in a Caucasian population for the first time. On the other hand, OPRM1 rs562859 seems not to influence the BUP pharmacology.
