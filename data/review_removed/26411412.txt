Cytochrome P450 in Cancer Susceptibility and Treatment.
Cytochrome 450 (CYP450) designates a group of enzymes abundant in smooth endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and epithelial cells of small intestines. The main function of CYP450 is oxidative catalysis of various endogenous and exogenous substances. CYP450 are implicated in phase I metabolism of 80% of drugs currently in use, including anticancer drugs. They are also involved in synthesis of various hormones and influence hormone-related cancers. CYP450 genes are highly polymorphic and their variants play an important role in cancer risk and treatment. Association studies and meta-analyses have been performed to decipher the role of CYP450 polymorphisms in cancer susceptibility. Cancer treatment involves multimodal therapies and evaluation of CYP450 polymorphisms is necessary for pharmacogenetic assessment of anticancer therapy outcomes. In addition, CYP450 inhibitors are being evaluated for improved pharmacokinetics and oral formulation of several anticancer drugs.
