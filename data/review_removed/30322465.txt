Pharmacogenomics, precision medicine, and implications for anesthesia care.
The study of how individual genetic differences, known as polymorphisms, change the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs is called pharmacogenomics. As the field of pharmacogenetics grows and continues to identify genetic polymorphisms, it is promising that the unmet need in this patient population may soon be addressed with personalized drug therapy based on the patient's genetic composition. Although encouraging, pharmacogenomic testing is underutilized in the United States and is often not covered by insurance companies. This manuscript describes the current state of precision medicine as it relates to perioperative care and how preoperative genomic analysis can help improve patient outcomes. This investigation also outlines future directions in this important and evolving field.
