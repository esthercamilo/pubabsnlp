<i>CYP3A5*3</i> and <i>CYP2C8*3</i> variants influence exposure and clinical outcomes of tacrolimus-based therapy.
<b>Aim:</b> The influence of variants in pharmacokinetics-related genes on long-term exposure to tacrolimus (TAC)-based therapy and clinical outcomes was investigated. <b>Patients & methods:</b> Brazilian kidney recipients were treated with TAC combined with everolimus (n = 178) or mycophenolate sodium (n = 97). The variants in <i>CYP2C8</i>, <i>CYP2J2</i>, <i>CYP3A4, CYP3A5</i>, <i>POR</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>ABCC2, ABCG2</i>, <i>SLCO1B1</i> and <i>SLCO2B1</i> were analyzed. <b>Main results:</b><i>CYP3A5*3/*3</i> genotype influenced increase in TAC concentration from week 1 to month 6 post-transplantation (p < 0.05). The living donor and <i>CYP2C8*3</i> variant were associated with reduced risk for delayed graft function (OR = 0.07; 95% CI = 0.03-0.18 and OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.20-0.99, respectively, p < 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> The <i>CYP3A5*3</i> variant is associated with increased early exposure to TAC. Living donor and <i>CYP2C8*3</i> variant seem to be protective factors for delayed graft function in kidney recipients.
