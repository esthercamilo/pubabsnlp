Impact of ethnicity on the natural history of Parkinson disease.
Parkinson disease (PD) affects people of all races and ethnicity worldwide. PD is a multineurotransmitter and multisystem disorder and our current concept of the natural history of PD has changed considerably over the past decades. Many aspects of this heterogeneous condition still remain unexplained; one aspect that is poorly studied is the role of ethnicity and manifest motor and non-motor PD. Some preliminary data suggest that the prodromal risk of developing PD, clinical symptom expression and the experience of living with the condition may vary between different ethnic groups. Several factors might play a role in the influence of ethnicity on PD, such as pharmacogenetics, sociocultural aspects and environmental exposures. Increased knowledge on the role of ethnicity in PD may help shed light on the symptom expression and treatment response of PD, address inequalities in health care delivery worldwide and improve the delivery of personalised medicine.
