Late response to rosuvastatin and statin-related myalgia due to <i>SLCO1B1</i>, <i>SLCO1B3</i>, <i>ABCB11</i>, and <i>CYP3A5</i> variants in a patient with Familial Hypercholesterolemia: a case report.
Statins are the most widely used cholesterol-lowering drugs for cardiovascular diseases prevention. However, some patients are refractory to treatment, whereas others experience statin-related adverse events (SRAE). It has been increasingly important to identify pharmacogenetic biomarkers for predicting statin response and adverse events. This case report describes a female patient with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who showed late response to rosuvastatin and experienced myalgia on statin treatment. In the first visit (V1), the patient reported myalgia to rosuvastatin 40 mg, which was interrupted for a 6-week wash-out period. In V2, rosuvastatin 20 mg was reintroduced, but her lipid profile did not show any changes after 6 weeks (V3) (LDL-c: 402 <i>vs.</i> 407 mg/dL). Her lipid profile markedly improved after 12 weeks of treatment (V4) (LDL-c: 208 mg/dL), suggesting a late rosuvastatin response. Her adherence to treatment was similar in V1 and V3 and no drug interactions were detected. Pharmacogenetic analysis revealed that the patient carries low-activity variants in <i>SLCO1B1*1B and*5</i>, <i>SLCO1B3</i> (rs4149117 and rs7311358), and <i>ABCB11</i> rs2287622, and the non-functional variant in <i>CYP3A5*3</i>. The combined effect of variants in pharmacokinetics-related genes may have contributed to the late response to rosuvastatin and statin-related myalgia. Therefore, they should be considered when assessing a patient's response to statin treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pharmacogenetic analysis on a case of late rosuvastatin response.
