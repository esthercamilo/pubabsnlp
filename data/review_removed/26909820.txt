When a Single Antiplatelet Agent for Stroke Prevention Is Not Enough: Current Evidence and Future Applications of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy.
For secondary stroke prevention, long-term dual antiplatelet therapy is not recommended due to increased bleeding risks. There is no specific evidence for using dual antiplatelet therapy for cervical artery dissection or for adding a second antiplatelet agent after a stroke while taking aspirin monotherapy. For patients with atrial fibrillation and stroke/TIA unable to tolerate warfarin, aspirin monotherapy is reasonable. Dual antiplatelet therapy carries a similar risk of major bleeding as warfarin that offsets reductions in stroke risk. Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for endovascular cerebrovascular stenting procedures, although the optimal duration of therapy is not well established. Short-term dual antiplatelet therapy when initiated acutely after minor stroke/TIA, particularly in Asian populations or for intracranial atherosclerosis, holds promise though studies to evaluate this approach more generally are ongoing. New antiplatelet agents and additional data on the pharmacogenetics of clopidogrel metabolism have the potential to help to individualize these recommendations moving forward.
