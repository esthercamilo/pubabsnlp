Genome-wide association study of liver enzyme elevation in an extended cohort of rheumatoid arthritis patients starting low-dose methotrexate.
<b>Aim:</b> A follow-up genome-wide association study (GWAS) in an extended cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients starting low-dose methotrexate (MTX) treatment was performed to identify further genetic variants associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation. <b>Patients & methods:</b> A GWAS was performed on 346 RA patients. Two outcomes within the first 6 months of MTX treatment were assessed: ALT >1.5-times the upper level of normal (ULN) and maximum level of ALT. <b>Results:</b> <i>SPATA9</i> (rs72783407) was significantly associated with maximum level of ALT (p = 2.58 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) and <i>PLCG2</i> (rs60427389) was tentatively associated with ALT >1.5 × ULN. <b>Conclusion:</b> Associations with SNPs in genes related to male fertility (<i>SPATA9</i>) and inflammatory processes (<i>PLCG2</i>) were identified.
