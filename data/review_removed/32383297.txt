Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of cocaine and its metabolites in behaviorally divergent inbred mouse strains.
Cocaine (COC) is a psychostimulant with a high potential for abuse and addiction. Risk for COC use disorder is driven, in part, by genetic factors. Animal models of addiction-relevant behaviors have proven useful for studying both genetic and nongenetic contributions to drug response. In a previous study, we examined initial locomotor sensitivity to COC in genetically diverse inbred mouse strains. That work highlighted the relevance of pharmacokinetics (PK) in initial locomotor response to COC but was limited by a single dose and two sampling points. The objective of the present study was to characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of COC and its metabolites (norcocaine and benzoylecgonine) in six inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, C57BL/6J, FVB/NJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, LG/J and LP/J) that exhibit extreme locomotor responses to cocaine. Mice were administered COC at one of four doses and concentrations of cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine were analyzed in both plasma and brain tissue at 5 different time points. Initial locomotor sensitivity to COC was used as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. We developed an empirical population PK model that simultaneously characterizes cocaine, norcocaine and benzoylecgonine in plasma and brain tissues. We observed interstrain variability occurring in the brain compartment that may contribute to pharmacodynamic differences among select strains. Our current work paves the way for future studies to explore strain-specific pharmacokinetic differences and identify factors other than PK that are responsible for the diverse behavioral response to COC across these inbred mouse strains.
