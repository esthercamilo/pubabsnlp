Pharmacogenomics at the Point of Care: A Community Pharmacy Project in British Columbia.
In this study 180 patients were consented and enrolled for pharmacogenomic testing based on current antidepressant/antipsychotic usage. Samples from patients were genotyped by PCR, MassArray, and targeted next generation sequencing. We also conducted a quantitative, frequency-based analysis of participants' perceptions using simple surveys. Pharmacogenomic information, including medication changes and altered dosing recommendations were returned to the pharmacists and used to direct patient therapy. Overwhelmingly, patients perceived pharmacists/pharmacies as an appropriate healthcare provider to deliver pharmacogenomic services. In total, 81 medication changes in 33 unique patients, representing 22% of all genotyped participants were recorded. We performed a simple drug cost analysis and found that medication adjustments and dosing changes across the entire cohort added $24.15CAD per patient per year for those that required an adjustment. Comparing different platforms, we uncovered a small number, 1.7%, of genotype discrepancies. We conclude that: (1). Pharmacists are competent providers of pharmacogenomic services. (2). The potential reduction in adverse drug responses and optimization of drug selection and dosing comes at a minimal cost to the health care system. (3). Changes in drug therapy, based on PGx tests, result in inconsequential changes in annual drug therapy cost with small cost increases just as likely as costs savings. (4). Pharmacogenomic services offered by pharmacists are ready for wide commercial implementation.
