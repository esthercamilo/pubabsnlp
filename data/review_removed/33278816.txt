Pitfalls and challenges associated with phenoconversion in forensic toxcicology.
In recent years, several publications have demonstrated the interest and the usefulness of pharmacogenetics in forensic toxicology. However, this approach remains namely focused on DNA-based phenotype, which may potentially lead to misinterpretation. Other determinants such as co-medication or physiological parameters may also impact the phenotype. This article aims to highlight the importance of considering such determinants in forensic toxicology, through the original case of a heroin-related fatality.
