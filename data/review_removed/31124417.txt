<i>NR3C1</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>TNF</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i> polymorphisms association with the response to the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum.
<b>Aim:</b> To evaluate the effects of gene polymorphisms in the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum with prednisone/thalidomide. <b>Patients & methods:</b> A total of 152 patients from different regions of Brazil were included. Generalized estimating equation was used to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms and haplotypes on the drug dose variation throughout the treatment. <b>Results:</b> An association between the genotype tuberculoid of polymorphism <i>ABCB1</i> 3435C>T (rs1045642; p = 0.02) and prednisone dose was found in the recessive model. An association between the haplotypes 1031T/-863C/-857C/-308A/-238G (p = 0.006) and 1031T/-863C/-857T/-308A/-238G (p = 0.040) of the <i>TNF</i> gene and the <i>CYP2C19*2</i> polymorphism were also identified, in relation to thalidomide dosage variation over the course of treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> This work presents the first pharmacogenetic report of association between gene polymorphisms and erythema nodosum leprosum treatment with prednisone/thalidomide.
