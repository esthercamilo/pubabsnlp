Pharmacogenetics-based population pharmacokinetic analysis and dose optimization of valproic acid in Chinese southern children with epilepsy: Effect of <i>ABCB1</i> gene polymorphism.
<b>Objective:</b> The aim of this study was to establish a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model of valproic acid (VPA) in pediatric patients with epilepsy in southern China, and provide guidance for individualized medication of VPA therapy. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 376 VPA steady-state trough concentrations were collected from 103 epileptic pediatric patients. The PPK parameter values for VPA were calculated by using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) method, and a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination processes was applied. Covariates included demographic information, concomitant medications and selected gene polymorphisms. Goodness-of-fit (GOF), bootstrap analysis, and visual predictive check (VPC) were used for model evaluation. In addition, we used Monte Carlo simulations to propose dose recommendations for different subgroup patients. <b>Results:</b> A significant effect of the patient age and <i>ABCB1</i> genotypes was observed on the VPA oral clearance (CL/F) in the final PPK model. Compared with patients with the <i>ABCB1</i> rs3789243 AA genotype, CL/F in patients with GG and AG genotypes was increased by 8% and reduced by 4.7%, respectively. The GOF plots indicated the satisfactory predictive performance of the final model, and the evaluation by bootstrap and VPC showed that a stable model had been developed. A table of individualized dosing regimens involving age and <i>ABCB1</i> genotype was constructed based on the final PPK model. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study quantitatively investigated the effects of patient age and <i>ABCB1</i> rs3789243 variants on the pharmacokinetic variability of VPA. The PPK models could be beneficial to individual dose optimization in epileptic children on VPA therapy.
