Have there been improvements in Alzheimer's disease drug discovery over the past 5 years?
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most important neurodegenerative disorder with a global cost worldwide of over $700 billion. Pharmacological treatment accounts for 10-20% of direct costs; no new drugs have been approved during the past 15Â years; and the available medications are not cost-effective. Areas covered: A massive scrutiny of AD-related PubMed publications (ps)(2013-2017) identified 42,053ps of which 8,380 (19.60%) were associated with AD treatments. The most prevalent pharmacological categories included neurotransmitter enhancers (11.38%), multi-target drugs (2.45%), anti-Amyloid agents (13.30%), anti-Tau agents (2.03%), natural products and derivatives (25.58%), novel drugs (8.13%), novel targets (5.66%), other (old) drugs (11.77%), anti-inflammatory drugs (1.20%), neuroprotective peptides (1.25%), stem cell therapy (1.85%), nanocarriers/nanotherapeutics (1.52%), and others (<1% each). Expert opinion: Unsuccessful outcomes in AD therapeutics are attributed to pathogenic misconceptions, erratic procedures in drug development and inappropriate regulations. Recommendations for the future are as follows: (i) the reconsideration of dominant pathogenic theories, (ii) the identification of reliable biomarkers, (iii) the redefinition of diagnostic criteria, (iv) new guidelines for disease management, (v) the reorientation of drug discovery programs, (vi) the updating of regulatory requirements, (vii) the introduction of pharmacogenomics in drug development and personalized treatments, and (viii) the implementation of preventive programs.
