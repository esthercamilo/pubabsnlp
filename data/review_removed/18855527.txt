Génome Québec & Montreal Heart Institute Pharmacogenomics Centre: a translational pharmacogenomics platform--from R&D to the clinic.
The Génome Québec and Montreal Heart Institute Pharmacogenomics Centre (Montreal, Canada), created in 2006, is a translational pharmacogenomics platform whose main objectives are to conduct pharmacogenomics research, provide pharmacogenomics services to the academic, biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, and integrate pharmacogenomics solutions into the healthcare system. The Centre has brought together a multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in genomics, bioinformatics and clinical trial research. All the Centre's clinical research studies are supported by the Centre's unique Good Laboratory Practice facility framework, which has the ability to perform pharmaceutical clinical trials and deliver clinical diagnostics under the highest standards. The Centre has successfully leveraged its experience and expertise in technology development and pharmacogenomics clinical trial work to attract funding and collaborative partnerships in both the public and private sectors.
