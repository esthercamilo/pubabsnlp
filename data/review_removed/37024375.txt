Comparison of targeted vs. expanded pharmacogenomic testing: What are we missing?
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) is used as a medication management strategy by a small but growing number of institutions. PGx allows prescribers to individually treat patients concordant with their genes. Recent litigation for preventable PGx-mediated adverse events highlights the need to accelerate PGx implementation for patient safety. Genetic variations cause drug metabolism, transport, and target changes, affecting medication response and tolerability. PGx testing often consists of targeted testing aimed at specific gene-drug pairs or disease states. Conversely, expanded panel testing can evaluate all known actionable gene-drug interactions, enhancing proactive clarity regarding patient response.
