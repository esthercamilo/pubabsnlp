Antiretroviral Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid: The Effect of Inflammation and Genetic Variants.
Neurocognitive impairments are common in people living with HIV. Some conditions, such as chronic inflammation, astrocyte infection and an impaired blood-brain barrier (BBBi), along with host genetic variants in transporter genes, may affect antiretroviral (ARV) exposure in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The aim of this study was to evaluate ARV CSF penetration according to compartmental inflammation, BBB permeability and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug transporter encoding genes. CSF neopterin (ELISA), plasma and CSF ARV concentrations (HPLC) and host genetic variants in <i>ABCC2</i>, <i>HNF4α</i>, <i>SLCO1A2</i> and <i>SLC22A6</i> (real-time PCR) were measured. Bi- and multivariate analyses were performed for single ARV and classes. We included 259 participants providing 405 paired plasma and CSF samples. CSF/plasma ratios (CPR) showed an increase for NRTIs and nevirapine with low penetrations for the majority of ARVs. At bi-variate analysis, several associations, including the effect of BBBi (emtricitabine, raltegravir), age (zidovudine and darunavir), and high CSF neopterin (NRTIs and <i>border-line</i> for PIs) were suggested. An association was found between genetic variants and integrase strand transfer (<i>ABCC2</i> and <i>HNF4α),</i> non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (<i>SLCO1A2</i>), and protease inhibitors <i>(SLC22A6).</i> At multivariate analysis age, gender, BMI, and altered BBB were independent predictors of nucleoside reverse transcriptase CSF concentrations; age (for protease inhibitors) and body mass index and altered BBB (integrase strand transfer inhibitors) were also associated with ARV CSF exposure. We describe factors associated with CSF concentrations, showing that demographic, BBB integrity and, partially, genetic factors may be predictors of drug passage in the central nervous system.
