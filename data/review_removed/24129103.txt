Present status and perspective of pharmacogenetics in Mexico.
Drug costs account for up to 24% of the country's health expenditure and there are 13,000 registered drugs being prescribed. Diabetes is the main cause of death in the country, with over 85% of diabetic patients currently under drug treatment. The importance of knowing interindividual variability in drug metabolism on Mexican populations is thus evident. The purpose of this article is to provide an overlook of the current situation of pharmacogenetic research in Mexico, focusing on drug-metabolizing enzymes, and the possibility of developing a phenotyping cocktail for Mexican populations. So far, 21 pharmacogenetic studies on Mexican population samples (Mestizos and Amerindian) have been published. These have reported interindividual variability through phenotyping and/or genotyping cytochromes: CYP2D6, 2C19, 2C9, 2E1, and phase II enzymes UGT and NAT2. Some cytochromes with important clinical implications have not yet been phenotyped in Mexican populations. The development of a cocktail adapted to them could be a significant contribution to a larger knowledge on drug response variability at a lower price and shorter time. There are validated phenotyping cocktails that present several practical advantages, being valuable, safe, and inexpensive tools in drug metabolism characterization, which require only a single experiment to provide information on several cytochrome activities.
