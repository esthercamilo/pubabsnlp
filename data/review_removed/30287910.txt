Pharmacogenomics in epithelial ovarian cancer first-line treatment outcome: validation of GWAS-associated NRG3 rs1649942 and BRE rs7572644 variants in an independent cohort.
The identification of predictive biomarkers for the first-line treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains a challenge. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic polymorphisms as predictors of EOC clinical outcome, the subsequent validation has not yet been performed. This study aims to validate the influence of Neuregulin 3 (NRG3) rs1649942 and Brain and reproductive organ-expressed (TNFRSF1A modulator) (BRE) rs7572644 GWAS-identified variants in an independent cohort of EOC patients from the North region of Portugal (n = 339) submitted to first-line treatment. Polymorphism genotypes were determined by real-time PCR using validated assays. Patients carrying the NRG3 rs1649942 A allele presented a significantly longer overall survival (OS) when compared to GG-genotype patients (log-rank test, P = 0.011) in the FIGO IV stage subgroup. No impact was observed for early-stage patients or considering disease-free survival (DFS) as an outcome. For FIGO I/II stage patients, BRE rs7572644 C allele carriers exhibit a decreased OS (P = 0.014) and DFS (P = 0.032) when compared to TT-homozygous patients. Furthermore, a Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed a three-fold increase in the risk of death (HR, 3.09; P = 0.015) and recurrence (HR, 3.33; P = 0.009) for FIGO I/II C allele carriers. No significant impact was observed for late-stage patients. The BRE rs7572644 and NRG3 rs1649942 genetic variants were validated in an independent cohort of EOC Portuguese patients, particularly in specific subgroups considering FIGO staging. Further functional post-GWAS analyses are indispensable to understand the biological mechanisms underlying the observed results.
