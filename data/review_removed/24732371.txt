Renin-angiotensin system gene polymorphisms predict the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation: a 10-year prospective follow-up study.
Little evidence is available regarding the impact of genetic polymorphisms on the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Angiotensin II plays a pathophysiologic role in prothrombotic atrial endocardial remodeling.
