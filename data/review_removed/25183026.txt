Absence of the human CYP2C8*3 allele in Ugandan children exposed to Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
Study of host pharmacogenetics can improve our knowledge of mechanisms of drug resistance selection and spread. This issue has recently been addressed with respect to chloroquine and amodiaquine in malaria endemic areas of West and East Africa. Here we report, from surveys performed in two different areas of Uganda, that the human CYP2C8*3 allele, which had been reported to be strongly associated with parasite drug resistance in Zanzibar, is absent, being a marker of genetic admixture of the Zanzibari population with a Caucasoid component. Moreover, a retrospective analysis of CYP2C8*2 and the Plasmodium falciparum drug resistant pfmdr1 86Y allele does not show any association, which may be related to the high level of drug resistance.
