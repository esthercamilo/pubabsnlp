A new statistical screening approach for finding pharmacokinetics-related genes in genome-wide studies.
Biomedical researchers usually test the null hypothesis that there is no difference of the population mean of pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters between genotypes by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Although a monotone increasing pattern with a number of alleles is expected for PK-related genes, the Kruskal-Wallis test does not consider a monotonic response pattern. For detecting such patterns in clinical and toxicological trials, a maximum contrast method has been proposed. We show how that method can be used with pharmacogenomics data to a develop test of association. Further, using simulation studies, we compare the power of the modified maximum contrast method to those of the maximum contrast method and the Kruskal-Wallis test. On the basis of the results of those studies, we suggest rules of thumb for which statistics to use in a given situation. An application of all three methods to an actual genome-wide pharmacogenomics study illustrates the practical relevance of our discussion.
