Implementation of genotype-guided dosing of warfarin with point-of-care genetic testing in three UK clinics: a matched cohort study.
Warfarin is a widely used oral anticoagulant. Determining the correct dose required to maintain the international normalised ratio (INR) within a therapeutic range can be challenging. In a previous trial, we showed that a dosing algorithm incorporating point-of-care genotyping information ('POCT-GGD' approach) led to improved anticoagulation control. To determine whether this approach could translate into clinical practice, we undertook an implementation project using a matched cohort design.
