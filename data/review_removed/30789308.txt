Polymorphisms in CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and ABCB1 affect agomelatine pharmacokinetics.
Agomelatine is an agonist of the melatoninergic receptors used for the treatment of depression. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of genetic polymorphisms in metabolising enzymes and the P-glycoprotein transporter on agomelatine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
