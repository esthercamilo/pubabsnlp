Pharmacogenomic study of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in Mexican pediatric patients.
<b>Background:</b> The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between well-defined genetic risk variants in <i>SLC28A3</i>, <i>RARG</i> and <i>UGT1A6</i> and anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in Mexican pediatric patients. <b>Methods:</b> We tested a cohort of 79 children treated with anthracyclines for the presence of <i>SLC28A3</i>-rs7853758, <i>RARG</i>-rs2229774 and <i>UGT1A6</i>-rs17863783. <b>Results:</b> The <i>SLC28A3</i>-rs7853758 variant was more frequent in this cohort, while the <i>UGT1A6</i>-rs17863783 and <i>RARG</i>-rs2229774 variants were present at lower frequencies. A clinically important decrease of fractional shortening was associated with <i>SLC28A3</i>-rs7853758 variant. <b>Conclusion:</b> In this cohort, 39.2% of patients carried the protective <i>SLC28A3</i> variant. A small number of tested patients have the risk variants of <i>UGT1A6</i> and <i>RARG</i>. None of the patients shared the two risk variants.
