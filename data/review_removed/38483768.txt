The Role of Pharmacogenomics in Rare Diseases.
Rare diseases have become an increasingly important public health priority due to their collective prevalence and often life-threatening nature. Incentive programs, such as the Orphan Drug Act have been introduced to increase the development of rare disease therapeutics. While the approval of these therapeutics requires supportive data from stringent pre-market studies, these data lack the ability to describe the causes of treatment response heterogeneity, leading to medications often being more harmful or less effective than predicted. If a Goal Line were to be used to describe the multifactorial continuum of phenotypic variations occurring in response to a medication, the 'Goal Posts', or the two defining points of this continuum, would be (1) Super-Response, or an extraordinary therapeutic effect; and (2) Serious Harm. Investigation of the pharmacogenomics behind these two extreme phenotypes can potentially lead to the development of new therapeutics, help inform rational use criteria in drug policy, and improve the understanding of underlying disease pathophysiology. In the context of rare diseases where cohort sizes are smaller than ideal, 'small data' and 'big data' approaches to data collection and analysis should be combined to produce the most robust results. This paper presents the importance of studying drug response in parallel to other research initiatives in rare diseases, as well as the need for international collaboration in the area of rare disease pharmacogenomics.
