Genetic variants influencing fluoropyrimidine based-therapy and available methods to detect them.
Many clinicians acknowledge the importance of genetics in drug response and are favourable about using genetic tests to guide therapy. The 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the backbone of different regimens for the treatment of several solid tumours. Unlikely, some patients develop gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicities when treated by the 5-FU, leading to the suspension of therapy. Current evidences of pharmacogenomics, have reported different polymorphisms associated to genes involved with fluoropyrimidine biotransformation. A multitude of methods has been applied to assess the mutational status of these genes, without defining a golden standard for the daily diagnostic routine, so far.
