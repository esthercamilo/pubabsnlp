How to Run the Pharmacogenomics Clinical Annotation Tool (PharmCAT).
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) investigates the genetic influence on drug response and is an integral part of precision medicine. While PGx testing is becoming more common in clinical practice and may be reimbursed by Medicare/Medicaid and commercial insurance, interpreting PGx testing results for clinical decision support is still a challenge. The Pharmacogenomics Clinical Annotation Tool (PharmCAT) has been designed to tackle the need for transparent, automatic interpretations of patient genetic data. PharmCAT incorporates a patient's genotypes, annotates PGx information (allele, genotype, and phenotype), and generates a report with PGx guideline recommendations from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and/or the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG). PharmCAT has introduced new features in the last 2â€‰years, including a variant call format (VCF) Preprocessor, the inclusion of DPWG guidelines, and functionalities for PGx research. For example, researchers can use the VCF Preprocessor to prepare biobank-scale data for PharmCAT. In addition, PharmCAT enables the assessment of novel partial and combination alleles that are composed of known PGx variants and can call CYP2D6 genotypes based on single and deletions in the input VCF file. This tutorial provides materials and detailed step-by-step instructions for how to use PharmCAT in a versatile way that can be tailored to users' individual needs.
