Survival analysis in association with GST gene polymorphism and Treatment outcomes of Gemcitabine and Cisplatin/Carboplatin-based chemotherapy among patients with Gallbladder Carcinoma.
Majority of the gallbladder cancer (GBC) cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage where chemotherapy alone (or in combination with other treatment methods) is mainly opted as therapeutic approach. However, success or failure of this approach largely depends on the interindividual genetic differences. Careful consideration on the genetic association could assist in the evaluation of patient's treatment response and survival rate. Hence, the present study aims to investigate the survival of patients with GBC and their treatment response to gemcitabine and cisplatin/carboplatin-based chemotherapy in association with Glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) gene polymorphism.
