Pharmacogenomics of antidepressant drugs.
While antidepressant pharmacotherapy is an effective treatment of depression, it is still hampered by the slow onset of appreciable clinical improvement and a series of side effects. Moreover, a substantial group of patients does not achieve remission or fails to respond at all. One possible source accounting for these variations in treatment outcome are genetic differences. In recent years a number of pharmacogenetic studies on antidepressant drugs have been published. This manuscript summarizes findings related to the pharmacogenetics of genes involved in the pharmacokinetics as well as pharmacodynamics of antidepressants to date. Illustrated by examples from current candidate gene- and whole genome association studies, this manuscript critically discusses aspects of pharmacogenetic studies in antidepressant response related to study design and clinical relevance.
