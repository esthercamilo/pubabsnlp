Associations between <i>SLCO1B1</i>, <i>APOE</i> and <i>CYP2C9</i> and lipid-lowering efficacy and pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin: a meta-analysis.
<b>Objective:</b> This meta-analysis was designed to investigate the associations between <i>SLCO1B1</i>, <i>APOE</i> and <i>CYP2C9</i> and the lipid-lowering effects and pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin. <b>Methods:</b> Studies were searched from inception to March 2023, including three SNPs related to fluvastatin, <i>SLCO1B1</i>, <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>APOE</i>. Weighted mean differences and corresponding 95% CIs were analyzed to evaluate the associations between SNPs and outcomes. <b>Results:</b> <i>SLCO1B1</i> 521T>C was associated with lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein reduction. Patients carrying 521CC or total cholesterol had a significantly higher area under the curve than those carrying 521TT, but no significant difference existed. <b>Conclusion:</b> <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>SLCO1B1</i> may be associated with the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin.
