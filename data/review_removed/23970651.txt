Sleep quality in efavirenz-treated Chinese HIV patients - comparing between GT and GG genotype of CYP2B6-516 G/T polymorphisms.
Seventy-two adult Chinese HIV-positive treatment-na√Øve patients were recruited in a study to evaluate prospectively the associations between CYP2B6 516 G/T polymorphisms and sleep quality following treatment with an efavirenz-based regimen. Overall, the patients gave an allelic frequency of 0.3 for CYP2B6 516 T, and a genotype frequency of 9.4% for TT. Compared to GG, GT gave a higher median value of plasma efavirenz level at four weeks (3.77 mg/L vs 2.59 mg/L, p < 0.001) and 12 months (3.57 mg/L vs 2.97 mg/L, p = 0.026). Using generalised estimating equations analysis to track the variance over time, there was poorer Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in GT compared to GG, while GT was associated with a higher efavirenz level of >4 mg/L. There was however no difference in the component sleep scores nor was there direct association between sleep quality and plasma efavirenz levels. The results suggested that CYP2B6 genotype was associated with different patterns of sleep problems, further investigation of which is warranted with the objective of optimizing therapy with efavirenz-based regimens.
