Genetic and clinical predictors of arthralgia during letrozole or anastrozole therapy in breast cancer patients.
Female patients with breast cancer frequently develop arthralgia when treated with aromatase inhibitors (AI). Although the mechanism of AI-induced arthralgia is unknown, potential biomarkers have been identified. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and genetic predictors of AI-induced arthralgia in a prospective cohort of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
