Delivering systems pharmacogenomics towards precision medicine through mathematics.
The latest developments of pharmacology in the post-genomic era foster the emergence of new biomarkers that represent the future of drug targets. To identify these biomarkers, we need a major shift from traditional genomic analyses alone, moving the focus towards systems approaches to elucidating genetic variation in biochemical pathways of drug response. Is there any general model that can accelerate this shift via a merger of systems biology and pharmacogenomics? Here we describe a statistical framework for mapping dynamic genes that affect drug response by incorporating its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways. This framework is expanded to shed light on the mechanistic and therapeutic differences of drug response based on pharmacogenetic information, coupled with genomic, proteomic and metabolic data, allowing novel therapeutic targets and genetic biomarkers to be characterized and utilized for drug discovery.
