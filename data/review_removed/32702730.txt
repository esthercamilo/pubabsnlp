In silico Drug Repurposing to combat COVID-19 based on Pharmacogenomics of Patient Transcriptomic Data.
The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to affect a growing number of populations in different parts of the world. In the current situation, drug repurposing is a viable strategy to combat COVID-19. The drugs targeting the host receptors that interact with SARS-CoV-2 are possible candidates. However, assessment of their effectiveness in COVID-19 patients is necessary before prioritizing them for further study. We attempted to shortlist the candidate drugs using an in-silico approach. First, we analysed two published transcriptomic data sets of COVID-19- and SARS-infected patients compared to healthy individuals to find the key pathways altered after infection. Then, using publicly available drug perturbational data sets in human cell lines from the Broad Institute Connectivity Map (CMAP), we assessed the effects of the approved drugs on the altered pathways. We also used the available pharmacogenomic data sets from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) portal to assess the effects of the altered pathways on resistance or sensitivity to the drugs in human cell lines. Our analysis identified many candidate drugs, some of which are already being investigated for treatment of COVID-19 and can serve as a basis for prioritizing additional viable candidate drugs for COVID-19.
