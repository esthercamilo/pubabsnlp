Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the letter, "Thoughtful Clinical Use of Pharmacogenetics in Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology." We appreciate the thoughtful consideration by Ramsey et al.<sup>1</sup> of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) policy statement on the Clinical Use of Pharmacogenetic Tests in Prescribing Psychotropic Medications for Children and Adolescents.<sup>2</sup> In this reply, we will highlight many of the important points that the authors have included and will also express our concerns regarding some of the authors' conclusions in light of the current level of evidence.
