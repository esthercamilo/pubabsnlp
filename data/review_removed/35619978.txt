Impact of Genetic Testing on Human Health:: The Current Landscape and Future for Personalized Medicine.
Advances in the field of human genetics over the past three decades have led to improvements in human health through development and availability of novel genetic testing approaches for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment therapy, safety, preventive screening and population-based risk assessment. In this commentary, I highlight the current landscape of genetic testing in Delaware with a focus on the genetic etiology and molecular diagnosis of pediatric disease, tailored treatment efficacy and safety through novel clinical trials and pharmacogenomics, and training in the application of genomic approaches to rare and common diseases. Future opportunities include integrating application of genetic information into clinical practice, improving genetics education, focusing on disparities and access, and advancing genomics and digital health technologies.
