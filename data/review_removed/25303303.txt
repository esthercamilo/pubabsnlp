Pharmacogenetic insights into migraine treatment in children.
Pediatric migraine is a disabling condition that can affect the everyday activities and emotional states of children. Due to the multifactorial character of the pathology and the variety of the disease's phenotypes, establishment of an effective treatment is often challenging. Pharmacological treatment is often administered off-label and includes very different drugs, from analgesics to antidepressants. Since interindividual variability in therapy response commonly causes inefficacy and an exacerbation of symptoms, pharmacogenetics may help to decrease the prescription rate of useless or unsafe drugs. If there are many drugs used in migraine, then there are even more candidate or established pharmacogenetic markers that are implicated in clinical profiles. This article presents the current situation regarding the pharmacogenetics of drugs used in pediatric migraine.
