Genotype-guided use of oral antithrombotic therapy: aÂ pharmacoeconomic perspective.
Pharmacogenomics focuses on tailoring therapy to the individual as opposed to the historical model of fitting the individual to the therapy, and it offers the potential to maximize medication efficacy while reducing adverse events. By its very nature, personalized medicine is conducive to a patient-centered care model. Oral antithrombotics as a class could benefit immensely from this type of approach because an imbalance of safety and efficacy in either direction can yield deadly consequences. Since the current healthcare climate in the USA requires thoughtful allocation of resources, pharmacoeconomic analysis has become critical for all stakeholders, and the adoption of new technologies hinges upon economic impact. This article summarizes the current state of genetics in oral antithrombotic therapy, including clinical relevance as well as cost-effectiveness from a US healthcare system perspective, and provides insight into the future of pharmacogenomics in treating and preventing thromboembolic disorders.
