Design Recommendations for Pharmacogenomics Clinical Decision Support Systems.
The use of pharmacogenomics (PGx) in clinical practice still faces challenges to fully adopt genetic information in targeting drug therapy. To incorporate genetics into clinical practice, many support the use of Pharmacogenomics Clinical Decision Support Systems (PGx-CDS) for medication prescriptions. This support was fueled by new guidelines to incorporate genetics for optimizing drug dosage and reducing adverse events. In addition, the complexity of PGx led to exploring CDS outside the paradigm of the basic CDS tools embedded in commercial electronic health records. Therefore, designing the right CDS is key to unleashing the full potential of pharmacogenomics and making it a part of clinicians' daily workflow. In this work, we 1) identify challenges and barriers of the implementation of PGx-CDS in clinical settings, 2) develop a new design approach to CDS with functional characteristics that can improve the adoption of pharmacogenomics guidelines and thus patient safety, and 3) create design guidelines and recommendations for such PGx-CDS tools.
