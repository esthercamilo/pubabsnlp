Chronic Pain Management in a CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizer: A Case Report for Oxycodone.
The objective of this case report is to illustrate pharmacogenomics (PGx)-guided oxycodone treatment, given the conflicting data on the analgesic response from oxycodone in Cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs). PGx-guided therapy can help improve treatment outcomes. This case report describes a 58-year-old patient who was prescribed oxycodone for chronic pain management. The patient presented with a history of inadequate pain control despite analgesic treatment with oxycodone (morphine milliequivalent [MME] = 22.5). Pharmacogenetic testing revealed that the patient was a CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizer (PM), which may shed light on the observed lack of analgesic response to oxycodone. The clinical pharmacist recommended switching to an alternative opioid not metabolized via the CYP2D6 pathway. The patient was subsequently switched to hydromorphone (MME = 16), resulting in improved pain control and fewer side effects. The newer hydromorphone dose accounted for a 30% MME dose reduction. The patient's initial average and worst pain score were 7 and 9 out of 10, respectively, per the numeric rating scale (NRS). Upon follow-up with the patient in two weeks, her average and worst pain scores improved to 3 and 3.5 out of 10, respectively, per the NRS. Further PGx testing results led to an overall positive outcome, such as her willingness to participate in physical therapy as a result of improved pain scores. This case highlights the importance of considering individual variability in drug metabolism when prescribing medications, particularly opioids such as oxycodone, to ensure optimal therapeutic outcomes and minimize the risk of adverse events in CYP2D6 PMs.
