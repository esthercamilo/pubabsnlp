Evaluation of Pharmacogenomics Testing of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes in the Military Health System From 2015 to 2020.
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) plays a fundamental role in personalized medicine, providing an evidence-based treatment approach centered on the relationship between genomic variations and their effect on drug metabolism. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of most clinically prescribed drugs and a major source of variability in drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. To assess the prevalence of PGx testing within the Military Health System (MHS), testing of specific CYP450 enzymes was evaluated. Data were retrospectively obtained from the Military Health System Management Analysis and Reporting Tool (M2) database. Patient demographics were identified for each test, along with TRICARE status, military treatment facility, clinic, and National Provider Identifier. A total of 929 patients received 1,833 PGx tests, predominantly composed of active duty/guard service members (N = 460; 49.5%), with highest testing rates in the army (51.5%). An even distribution in testing was observed among gender, with the highest rates in Caucasians (41.7%). Of the CYP enzymes assessed, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 accounted for 87.8% of all PGx CYP testing. The majority of patients were tested in psychiatry clinics (N = 496; 53.4%) and primary care clinics (N = 233; 25.1%), accounting for 56.4% and 24.8% of all tests, respectively. Testing was found to be provider driven, suggesting a lack of a standardized approach to PGx and its application in patient care within the MHS. We initially recommend targeted education and revising testing labels to be more uniform and informative. Long-term recommendations include establishing pharmacy-driven protocols and point-of-care PGx testing to optimize patient outcomes.
