A pilot exome sequencing study suggests that germline variants influence methotrexate-induced toxicities in pediatric patients with localized osteosarcoma.
Osteosarcoma (OS) is a rare pediatric cancer for which therapeutic approaches, including chemotherapy and surgery, show a wide interindividual variability in patient response, both in terms of adverse events and therapy efficacy. There is growing evidence that this individual variable response to therapies is also influenced by inherited genetic variations. However, the results obtained to date in these pediatric cancers have been contradictory and often lack validation in independent series. Additionally, these studies frequently focused only on a limited number of polymorphisms in candidate genes.
