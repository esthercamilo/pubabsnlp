Pharmacogenetic testing by polymorphic markers G1846A (CYP2D6*4) and C100T (CYP2D6*10) of the CYP2D6 gene in coronary heart disease patients taking ββ-blockers in the Republic of Sakha (YAKUTIA).
Background The aim of this study was to determine carrier frequencies of the polymorphic markers G1846A (CYP2D6*4) and C100T (CYP2D6*10) of the CYP2D6 gene in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients in Russian and Yakut ethnic groups. The association between the administration of higher doses of bisoprolol and metoprolol and the carriage of these polymorphic markers related to the decreased function of the haplotype of CYP2D6 was also studied. Methods The study included 201 CHD patients (aged 66±8.7 years) receiving metoprolol in titrated dose (12.5-150 mg), bisoprolol (2.5-10 mg) or atenolol (50 mg). Ninety-three patients were Russian (30 men and 63 women), and 108 patients were Yakut (54 men and 54 women). Results In genotyping CHD patients in the Russian and Yakut ethnic groups, there was no significant difference in the prevalence rate of the polymorphic markers G1846A (10.8 vs. 10.2; p=0.871) and C100T (16.1 vs. 16.2; p=1). In patients carrying the polymorphic marker G1846A, the dose of bisoprolol was established to be lower than that in the control group (p=0.0289). Conclusions The carriage frequency of polymorphic markers, which theoretically should differ between Russians and Yakuts as representatives of two different races, in practice turned out to be the same.
