PharmGKB: an integrated resource of pharmacogenomic data and knowledge.
The PharmGKB is a publicly available online resource that aims to facilitate understanding how genetic variation contributes to variation in drug response. It is not only a repository of pharmacogenomics primary data, but it also provides fully curated knowledge including drug pathways, annotated pharmacogene summaries, and relationships among genes, drugs, and diseases. This unit describes how to navigate the PharmGKB Web site to retrieve detailed information on genes and important variants, as well as their relationship to drugs and diseases. It also includes protocols on our drug-centered pathway, annotated pharmacogene summaries, and our Web services for downloading the underlying data. Workflow on how to use PharmGKB to facilitate design of the pharmacogenomic study is also described in this unit.
