<i>HNF1A</i> mutation in a Thai patient with maturity-onset diabetes of the young: A case report.
Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is the most common form of monogenic diabetes. The disease is transmitted in autosomal dominant mode and diabetes is usually diagnosed before age 25 year. MODY 3 is caused by mutation of hepatocyte nuclear factor (<i>HNF</i>) <i>1A</i> genes and is the most common MODY subtype. Diagnosis of MODY 3 is crucial since glycemic control can be accomplished by very low dose of sulfonylurea. In this report we described a Thai MODY 3 patient who had excellence plasma glucose control by treating with glicazide 20 mg per day and insulin therapy can be discontinued.
