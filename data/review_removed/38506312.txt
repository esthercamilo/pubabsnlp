Genetic risk factors for drug-induced long QT syndrome: findings from a large real-world case-control study.
<b>Aim:</b> Drug-induced long QT syndrome (diLQTS), an adverse effect of many drugs, can lead to sudden cardiac death. Candidate genetic variants in cardiac ion channels have been associated with diLQTS, but several limitations of previous studies hamper clinical utility. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the associations of <i>KCNE1</i>-D85N, <i>KCNE2</i>-I57T and <i>SCN5A</i>-G615E with diLQTS in a large observational case-control study (6,083 self-reported white patients treated with 27 different high-risk QT-prolonging medications; 12.0% with diLQTS). <b>Results:</b> <i>KCNE1</i>-D85N significantly associated with diLQTS (adjusted odds ratio: 2.24 [95% CI: 1.35-3.58]; p = 0.001). Given low minor allele frequencies, the study had insufficient power to analyze <i>KCNE2</i>-I57T and <i>SCN5A</i>-G615E. <b>Conclusion:</b> <i>KCNE1</i>-D85N is a risk factor for diLQTS that should be considered in future clinical practice guidelines.
