An update on recently approved long-acting injectable second-generation antipsychotics: Knowns and unknowns regarding their use.
There are now 9 available FDA-approved second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics including aripiprazole (3), olanzapine (1), paliperidone (3), and risperidone (2).

However, there are still unknowns with these medications.
