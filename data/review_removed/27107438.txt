Automated identification of molecular effects of drugs (AIMED).
Genomic profiling information is frequently available to oncologists, enabling targeted cancer therapy. Because clinically relevant information is rapidly emerging in the literature and elsewhere, there is a need for informatics technologies to support targeted therapies. To this end, we have developed a system for Automated Identification of Molecular Effects of Drugs, to help biomedical scientists curate this literature to facilitate decision support.
