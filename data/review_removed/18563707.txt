Pharmacogenetics of methylphenidate response in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: association with the dopamine transporter gene (SLC6A3).
Pharmacogenetic studies investigating the 40-bp VNTR polymorphism at SLC6A3 and methylphenidate response have shown conflicting results and large differences in study design and efficacy endpoints. Our objective was to investigate the relation between the 3'-VNTR at SLC6A3 and variability in methylphenidate response in a sample of 141 ADHD children and adolescents, assessed before and after methylphenidate treatment with both clinical and neuropsychological outcome measures. 10-R homozygotes were significantly overrepresented in the low response group, but no genotype effect was shown in cognitive variables improvement. A meta-analysis of pharmacogenetic studies with comparable data (responders vs. non-responders) on a total of 475 subjects showed a significant association between the 10-10 genotype and low rates of methylphenidate response (mean Odds Ratio = 0.46; 95% CI [0.28-0.76]). Heterogeneity between these studies did not reach a significant level but, as publications with different endpoints were excluded from this meta-analysis, our results do not rule out a possible influence of study design.
