Correlation of Genetic Polymorphism of CYP3A5 to Cyclophosphamide Efficacy and Toxicity in Rhabdomyosarcoma Pediatric Egyptian Cancer Patients.
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) accounts for 50% of soft tissue sarcomas and 7% of pediatric malignancies. Cyclophosphamide (CPA) is the cornerstone of therapy and is a prodrug that is activated by the highly polymorphic drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A5. We aim to examine the possible CYP3A5 polymorphism association with CPA efficacy, survival outcomes, and toxicity in Egyptian pediatric RMS patients.
