Clinical implementation of drug metabolizing gene-based therapeutic interventions worldwide.
Over the last few years, the field of pharmacogenomics has gained considerable momentum. The advances of new genomics and bioinformatics technologies propelled pharmacogenomics towards its implementation in the clinical setting. Since 2007, and especially the last-5Â years, many studies have focused on the clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics while identifying obstacles and proposed strategies and approaches for overcoming them in the real world of primary care as well as outpatients and inpatients clinics. Here, we outline the recent pharmacogenomics clinical implementation projects and provide details of the study designs, including the most predominant and innovative, as well as clinical studies worldwide that focus on outpatients and inpatient clinics, and primary care. According to these studies, pharmacogenomics holds promise for improving patients' health in terms of efficacy and toxicity, as well as in their overall quality of life, while simultaneously can contribute to the minimization of healthcare expenditure.
