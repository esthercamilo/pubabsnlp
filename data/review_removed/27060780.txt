A study of HLA-B∗15:02 in a Sri Lankan population: Implications for pharmacogenomic testing.
HLA-B∗15:02 is known as a biomarker for carbamazepine (CBZ) induced Steven-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN) in some Asian populations. Hence United States Federal Drug Administration (USFDA) recommends HLA-B∗15:02 screening for Asian and other populations with a high prevalence of HLA-B∗15:02, prior to the administration of carbamazepine. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of HLA-B∗15:02 in a cohort of Sri Lankans. We observed an overall prevalence of 4.3% (4/93) among 93 Sri Lankans comprising 32 Sinhalese, 30 Sri Lankan Tamils and 31 Moors. The allele was detected in 3 [9.3%; 3/32] Sinhalese, 0 [0%; 0/30] Sri Lankan Tamils and in 1 [3%; 1/31] Moor. The overall prevalence of HLA-B∗15:02 in this population was close to that of other populations where the USFDA has recommended HLA-B∗15:02 screening. A larger study is required to confirm these findings, especially among the Sinhalese where the frequency appears to be high.
