Pharmacogenetic contribution of leptin gene polymorphism in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
Leptin has recently attracted more attention due to its specific effects in the pathogenesis of malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association between variants of -2548 G/A polymorphism in leptin (LEP) gene and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), with respect to the treatment responsiveness. A sample of 91 patients with CTCL was compared to 198 control individuals. The CTCL men with AG and/or GG genotype were more likely to receive the topical steroids treatment (odds ratio 7.88, 95% confidential interval 1.51-41.04) when compared to AA patients. Our data supports the possible involvement of LEP-2548G/A polymorphism in CTCL treatment responsiveness and thus might provide important information for individual therapy tailoring.
