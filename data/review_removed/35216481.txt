Pharmacogenomics of Anti-TNF Treatment Response Marks a New Era of Tailored Rheumatoid Arthritis Therapy.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most commonly occurring chronic inflammatory arthritis, the exact mechanism of which is not fully understood. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-targeting drugs has been shown to exert high effectiveness for RA, which indicates the key importance of this cytokine in this disease. Nevertheless, the response to TNF inhibitors varies, and approximately one third of RA patients are non-responders, which is explained by the influence of genetic factors. Knowledge in the field of pharmacogenomics of anti-TNF drugs is growing, but has not been applied in the clinical practice so far. Different genome-wide association studies identified a few single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with anti-TNF treatment response, which largely map genes involved in T cell function. Studies of the gene expression profile of RA patients have also indicated specific gene signatures that may be useful to develop novel prognostic tools. In this article, we discuss the significance of TNF in RA and present the current knowledge in pharmacogenomics related to anti-TNF treatment response.
