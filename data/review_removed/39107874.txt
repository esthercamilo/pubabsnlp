Exploring the contribution of genetic variants to high sunitinib exposure in patients with cancer.
Sunitinib exhibits considerable interindividual variability in exposure. While the target total plasma concentration of sunitinib and its active metabolite is 50-87.5 ng/mL for the intermittent dosing schedule, ~10-21% of patients experience higher exposures (>87.5 ng/mL), correlated with an increased risk for toxicity. Previous research identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in genes from the sunitinib pharmacokinetic pathway to be associated with efficacy and toxicity. However, significant interindividual variability in exposure remains unexplained. Our aim was to identify genetic variants associated with supratherapeutic exposure of sunitinib.
