Genetic Polymorphisms of Pharmacogenes among the Genetically Isolated Circassian Subpopulation from Jordan.
Several genetic variants have been identified that cause variation among different populations and even within individuals of a similar descent. This leads to interindividual variations in the optimal dose of the drug that is required to sustain the treatment efficiency. In this study, 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within several pharmacogenes were analyzed in 128 unrelated subjects from a genetically isolated group of Circassian people living in Jordan. We also compared these variant distributions to other ethnic groups that are available at two databases (Genome 1000 and eXAC). Our results revealed that the distribution of allele frequencies within genes among Circassians in Jordan showed similarities and disparities when compared to other populations. This study provides a powerful base for clinically relevant SNPs to enhance medical research and future pharmacogenomic studies. Rare variants detected in isolated populations can significantly guide to novel loci involved in the development of clinically relevant traits.
