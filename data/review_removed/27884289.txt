Psoriasis Therapy: Breakthroughs inÂ Pharmacogenomics or in Pharmacology?
As the cost of psoriasis therapies skyrockets, it becomes increasingly important to find biomarkers that predict which patients will respond to expensive medications. The ability to predict response to a specific therapy is particularly important for medications that are effective in only a small portion of the population. As we develop medications that clear most patients, the need for a predictive biomarker diminishes. Nevertheless, the importance of pharmacogenomics is likely to increase as the cost of drugs continues to rise.
