[Evaluation of therapy efficiency in patients with combined course of copd and osteoarthritis].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease that is characterized by chronic airflow limitation, a variety of pathological changes in the lungs, significant extrapulmonary manifestations, and severe comorbidities which may further aggravate the course of COPD [GOLD, 2013]. Intensity of systemic manifestations increases with the progression of obstruction, therefore the abovementioned symptoms are often overlooked and become apparent in the later stages of the disease. Systemic manifestations impair the quality of life, lead to early disability and significantly contribute to mortality in patients with COPD. Diseases of cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems are the most serious and socially significant systemic manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Currently, there is no doubt that the activation of non-specific and specific immune responses in patients with COPD is associated with the influence of a number of universal mediators, among which a special place belongs to the cytokine network that controls implementation processes of the immune and inflammatory reactivity. The aim of our work was to increase the effectiveness of treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in combination with osteoarthritis based on the study of clinical course, assessment of patient's life quality and substantiation of pharmacological correction.
