Evaluation of the impact of body mass index on venous thromboembolism risk factors.
In this paper, we investigate the interaction impacts of body mass index (BMI) on the other important risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), using deep venous thrombosis (DVT) patient data from the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC). We apply eight machine learning techniques, including naive Bayes classifier (NB), support vector machine (SVM), elastic net regression (ENET), logistic regression (LR), lasso regression (LAR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest model (RF). The RF method is selected as the best model for classification. Out of 33 features considered in this study, we identify 12 variables as relatively important risk factors for VTE. Finally, we examine the interaction impacts of BMI on these important VTE risk factors. We conclude that the impacts of risk factors on VTE incidence are varying across different BMI groups, and the variations are different for different risk factors. Therefore the interaction impacts of BMI on the other risk factors have to be taken into account in order to better understand the incidence of VTE.
