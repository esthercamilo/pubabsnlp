Keeping pace with <i>CYP2D6</i> haplotype discovery: innovative methods to assign function.
The discovery of haplotypes with unknown or uncertain function in the <i>CYP2D6</i> pharmacogene is outpacing the capabilities of traditional <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> approaches to characterize their function. This challenge will undoubtedly grow as pharmacogenomic research becomes more inclusive of globally diverse populations. As accurate phenotypic assignment is paramount to the utility of pharmacogenomics, high-throughput technologies are needed for this complex pharmacogene. We describe the evolving landscape of innovative approaches to assign function to <i>CYP2D6</i> haplotypes and possibilities for adopting these technologies into cohesive processes. Promising approaches include ADME-optimized prediction frameworks, machine learning algorithms, deep mutational scanning and phenoconversion predictions. Implementing these approaches will lead to improved personalization of treatment for patients.
