Screening of Novel Pharmacogenetic Candidates for Mercaptopurine-Induced Toxicity in Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
A small proportion of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may experience severe leukopenia after treating with 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), which can be largely explained by germline variants in <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i>. However, a minority of patients who suffered such adverse drug reaction have <i>NUDT15</i> <sup>wt/wt</sup> <i>TPMT</i> <sup>wt/wt</sup> genotype, indicating that other genetic factors may take part in. In this study, we genotyped 539 exon-located nonsilent pharmacogenetic variants in genes involved in phase I/II of drug metabolism in 173 pediatric patients with ALL and conducted association screening for 6MP-induced leukopenia. Besides <i>NUDT15</i> (rs116855232, <i>P</i> = 6.4 Ã— 10<sup>-11</sup>) and <i>TPMT</i> (rs1142345, <i>P</i> = 0.003), a novel variant was identified in <i>CYP2A7</i> gene (i.e., rs73032311, <i>P</i> = 0.0007), which is independent of <i>NUDT15/TPMT</i> variant. In addition, a variant (i.e., rs4680) in COMT is significantly associated with 6MP-induced hepatotoxicity (<i>P</i> = 0.007). In conclusion, variants in <i>CYP2A7</i> and <i>COMT</i> may be considered as novel potential pharmacogenetic markers for 6MP-induced toxicities, but additional independent validations with large sample size and investigations on related mechanisms are further needed.
