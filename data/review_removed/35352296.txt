Role of Pharmacogenomics in Individualizing Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease.
The development of Alzheimer's disease therapeutics has been challenging, with 99% of clinical trials failing to find a significant difference between drug and placebo. While the quest continues for more effective treatments, there is emerging evidence that pharmacogenetic considerations are important factors in regard to metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity of drugs. Currently, there are five US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; three acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and aducanumab. Introducing a limited genetic panel consisting of APOE4, CYP2D6*10, and BChE*K would optimize acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy, facilitate immunotherapy risk assessment, and inform an amyloid-related imaging abnormality surveillance schedule. In view of the genetic heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease identified in genome-wide association studies, pharmacogenetics is expected to play an increasing role in mechanism-specific treatment strategies and personalized medicine.
