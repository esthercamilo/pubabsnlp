Pain Perception and the Opioid Receptor Delta 1.
Genetic factors play an integral role in the perception of pain, and studies have only recently begun to explore the degree to which these factors affect clinical decisions. The process of prescribing opioids is greatly influenced by an individual's pain perception, which can vary based on several factors including genetic variation. Opioid receptor delta 1 (OPRD1) plays a significant role in the perception of both pain and its relief via opioids, and it shows significant variability between individuals. Herein, we discuss the nature of the OPRD1 receptor and the value of further research into its effects, particularly in the realm of pain management.
