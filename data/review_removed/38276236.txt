The Case for Pre-Emptive Pharmacogenetic Screening in South Africa.
Lack of equitable representation of global genetic diversity has hampered the implementation of genomic medicine in under-represented populations, including those on the African continent. Data from the multi-national Pre-emptive Pharmacogenomic Testing for Preventing Adverse Drug Reactions (PREPARE) study suggest that genotype guidance for prescriptions reduced the incidence of clinically relevant adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by 30%. In this study, hospital dispensary trends from a tertiary South African (SA) hospital (Steve Biko Academic Hospital; SBAH) were compared with the drugs monitored in the PREPARE study. Dispensary data on 29 drugs from the PREPARE study accounted for ~10% of total prescriptions and ~9% of the total expenditure at SBAH. VigiLyze data from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority were interrogated for local ADRs related to these drugs; 27 were listed as being suspected, concomitant, or interacting in ADR reports. Furthermore, a comparison of pharmacogene allele frequencies between African and European populations was used to frame the potential impact of pre-emptive pharmacogenetic screening in SA. Enumerating the benefit of pre-emptive pharmacogenetic screening in SA will only be possible once we initiate its full application. However, regional genomic diversity, disease burden, and first-line treatment options could be harnessed to target stratified PGx today.
