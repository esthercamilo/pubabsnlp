Analysis of CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms in population of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Differences in the frequency of distribution of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) allelic variants have been demonstrated between distinct ethnic groups, contributing to observed interindividual variation in drug response. In this study we determined, for the first time, prevalence of the common allelic variants of the polymorphic CYP enzymes, CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*3, in the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH).
