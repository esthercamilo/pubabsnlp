Establishing a Longitudinal Opioid Pharmacogenomic Registry for Cancer Patients: Feasibility and Acceptability.
<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Individual genetic variation can affect both pain expression and opioid response. Large cohort datasets are required to validate evidence influencing genomic factors in opioid response. This study examined the feasibility of establishing an opioid pharmacogenomics registry for cancer patients containing longitudinal matched clinical, symptom, pharmacological, and genomic data, with an <i>a priori</i> feasibility target of 50 participants within 12 months. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Consecutive patients with advanced cancer receiving opioids across five palliative care services were recruited. Clinical data (demographics, pain data, adverse effects, medications) and blood (DNA, RNA, pharmacokinetics) were collected over two time points. Patient and clinician qualitative interviews were conducted to assess acceptability. This study was approved by the SVHA Ethics Committee, Melbourne, Australia (HREC 252/18). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Enrollment for the registry was deemed feasible. Fifty-eight participants were recruited (median age 63.7, 45% female, 83% complete data), with the most frequent diagnosis being lung cancer (<i>n</i> = 18, 33%) and oxycodone the most frequently prescribed opioid (<i>n</i> = 30, 52%). Qualitative data indicated positive engagement from both patients and clinicians. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Establishing a longitudinal opioid pharmacogenomic registry in patients with cancer receiving palliative care is feasible and readily acceptable.
