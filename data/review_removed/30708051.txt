Neuropharmacology, pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics of aggression: The zebrafish model.
The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly utilized as a powerful new model organism in neurobehavioral research. Aggression is a common symptom of many CNS disorders, has some genetic determinants and can be modulated pharmacologically in humans and animal model species. Mounting evidence suggests zebrafish as a useful tool to study neurobiology of aggression, and its pharmacological and genetic regulation. Here, we discuss mechanisms of zebrafish aggression and their pharmacological, pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic models, as well as recent developments and existing challenges in this field. We also emphasize the growing utility of zebrafish models in translational neuropharmacological research of aggression, fostering future discoveries of potential therapeutic agents for aggressive behavior.
