SYNERGxDB: an integrative pharmacogenomic portal to identify synergistic drug combinations for precision oncology.
Drug-combination data portals have recently been introduced to mine huge amounts of pharmacological data with the aim of improving current chemotherapy strategies. However, these portals have only been investigated for isolated datasets, and molecular profiles of cancer cell lines are lacking. Here we developed a cloud-based pharmacogenomics portal called SYNERGxDB (http://SYNERGxDB.ca/) that integrates multiple high-throughput drug-combination studies with molecular and pharmacological profiles of a large panel of cancer cell lines. This portal enables the identification of synergistic drug combinations through harmonization and unified computational analysis. We integrated nine of the largest drug combination datasets from both academic groups and pharmaceutical companies, resulting in 22 507 unique drug combinations (1977 unique compounds) screened against 151 cancer cell lines. This data compendium includes metabolomics, gene expression, copy number and mutation profiles of the cancer cell lines. In addition, SYNERGxDB provides analytical tools to discover effective therapeutic combinations and predictive biomarkers across cancer, including specific types. Combining molecular and pharmacological profiles, we systematically explored the large space of univariate predictors of drug synergism. SYNERGxDB constitutes a comprehensive resource that opens new avenues of research for exploring the mechanism of action for drug synergy with the potential of identifying new treatment strategies for cancer patients.
