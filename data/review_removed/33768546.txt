Population pharmacokinetic analysis and dosing guidelines for tacrolimus co-administration with Wuzhi capsule in Chinese renal transplant recipients.
Tacrolimus (TAC) is a first-line immunosuppressant which is used to prevent transplant rejection after solid organ transplantation (SOT). However, it has a narrow therapeutic index and high individual variability in pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenomics (PG). It has been reported that the metabolism of TAC can be affected by genetic factors, leading to different rates of metabolism in different subjects. Wuzhi Capsule (WZC) is a commonly used TAC-sparing agent in Chinese SOT to reduce TAC dosing due to its inhibitory effect on TAC metabolism by enzymes of the CYP3A subfamily. The aims of this study were to assess the effect of TAC+WZC co-administration and genetic polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of TAC, by using a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model. A dosing guideline for individualized TAC dosing is proposed based on the PPK study.
