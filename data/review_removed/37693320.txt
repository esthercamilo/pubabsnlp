Pharmacogenetics and phenoconversion: the influence on side effects experienced by psychiatric patients.
<b>Introduction:</b> Preventing side effects is important to ensure optimal psychopharmacotherapy and therapeutic adherence among psychiatric patients. Obtaining the pharmacogenetic profile of <i>CYP2C19</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i> can play an important role in this. When the genotype-predicted phenotype shifts because of the use of co-medication, this is called phenoconversion. The aim was to study the influence of the pharmacogenetic (PGx) profile and phenoconversion on side effects experienced by psychiatric patients. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective cohort study was performed using data from 117 patients from a psychiatric outpatient clinic. Patients were genotyped with a psychiatric PGx panel and side effects were evaluated using the <i>Udvalg for Kliniske Unders√∏lgelser</i> side effects rating scale (UKU). <b>Results:</b> Of all patients, 10.3% and 9.4% underwent phenoconversion (any shift in predicted phenotype) for <i>CYP2C19</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i> respectively. No significant associations were found between the phenotype and UKU-score. 75% of the patients with an Intermediate metabolizer (IM) or Poor metabolizer (PM) phenoconverted phenotype of <i>CYP2C19</i> experienced nausea and vomiting compared to 9.1% of the Normal metabolizer (NM) and Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM) patients (<i>p</i> = 0.033). 64% of the patients with an IM or PM phenoconverted phenotype of <i>CYP2D6</i> experienced the side effect depression compared to 30.4% NMs and UMs (<i>p</i> = 0.020). <i>CYP2D6</i> IM and PM patients had a higher concentration-dose ratio than NM patients (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Discussion:</b> This study underlines the importance to consider phenoconversion when looking at a patient's genotype. This is important for a better prediction of the phenotype and preventing possible side effects under a specific psychopharmacotherapy.
