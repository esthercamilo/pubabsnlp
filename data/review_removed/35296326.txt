Design and implementation of a novel pharmacogenetic assay for the identification of the CYP2D6*10 genetic variant.
Tamoxifen is considered to be the most widely used adjuvant therapy for hormone receptor positive breast cancer in premenopausal women. However, it is reported that nearly 30% of patients receiving tamoxifen therapy have shown reduced or no benefits. This may be due to the high inter-individual variations in the CYP2D6 gene that is involved in tamoxifen metabolism. The CYP2D6*10 gene variant (rs1065852C>T) is reported to be commonly found in Asian and South Asian populations. The present study was undertaken to design a novel pharmacogenetic assay (Single step-Tetra Arms Polymerase Chain Reaction) for the identification of the CYP2D6*10 variant and implement the designed assay by genotyping a cohort of breast cancer patients.
