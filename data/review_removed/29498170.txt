Pharmacogenetics of Dopamine β-Hydroxylase in cocaine dependence therapy with doxazosin.
The α<sub>1</sub> -adrenergic antagonist, doxazosin, has improved cocaine use disorder (CUD) presumably by blocking norepinephrine (NE) stimulation and reward from cocaine-induced NE increases. If the NE levels for release were lower, then doxazosin might more readily block this NE stimulation and be more effective. The NE available for release can be lower through a genetic polymorphism in dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) (C-1021T, rs1611115), which reduces DβH's conversion of dopamine to NE. We hypothesize that doxazosin would be more effective in CUD patients who have these genetically lower DβH levels. This 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial included 76 CUD patients: 49 with higher DβH levels from the DBH CC genotype and 27 with lower DβH levels from T-allele carriers (CT or TT). Patients were randomized to doxazosin (8 mg/day, N = 47) or placebo (N = 29) and followed with thrice weekly urine toxicology and once weekly cognitive behavioral psychotherapy. Cocaine use was reduced at a higher rate among patients in the doxazosin than in the placebo arm. We found significantly lower cocaine use rates among patients carrying the T-allele (CT/TT) than the CC genotype. The percentage of cocaine positive urines was reduced by 41 percent from baseline in the CT/TT group with low DβH and NE levels, as compared with no net reduction in the CC genotype group with normal DβH and NE levels. The DBH polymorphism appears play an important role in CUD patients' response to doxazosin treatment, supporting a pharmacogenetic association and potential application for personalized medicine.
