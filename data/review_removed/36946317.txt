<i>IL16</i> and factor V gene variations are associated with asparaginase-related thrombosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.
<b>Aim:</b> We previously conducted exome-wide association study in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and identified association of five SNPs with asparaginase-related thrombosis. Here we aimed to replicate these findings in an independent patient cohort and through analyses <i>in vitro</i>. <b>Patients & methods:</b> SNPs located in <i>IL16</i>, <i>MYBBP1A</i>, <i>PKD2L1</i>, <i>RIN3</i> and <i>MPEG1</i> genes were analyzed in patients receiving Dana-Farber Cancer InstituteÂ acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment protocols 05-001 and 11-001. Thrombophilia-related variations were also analysed. <b>Results:</b> <i>IL16</i> rs11556218 conferred higher risk of thrombosis and higher <i>in vitro</i> sensitivity to asparaginase. The association was modulated by the treatment protocol, risk group and immunophenotype. A crosstalk between factor V Leiden, non-O blood groups and higher risk of thrombosis was also seen. <b>Conclusion:</b> <i>IL16</i> and factor V Leiden variations are implicated in asparaginase-related thrombosis.
