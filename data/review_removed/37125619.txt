Patient satisfaction with return of pharmacogenomic results utilizing a patient portal message.
<b>Background:</b> Returning pharmacogenomics (PGx) results to patients is complex and challenging. Patients prefer provider education; however, a gap in provider comfort in PGx results has been documented. <b>Objectives:</b> This study's purpose was to evaluate satisfaction with the return of PGx test results using a patient portal message. <b>Methods:</b> A survey was sent to two cohorts with PGx results, one that received a PGx result message and one that did not. <b>Results:</b> Following implementation of the PGx result message, there was a decrease in patients reporting negative responses surrounding satisfaction in the return of their PGx results, with 39% responding negatively pre-implementation and 21% post-implementation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Satisfaction with the return of results improved following the implementation of a patient portal message.
