Interindividual variability of methadone response: impact of genetic polymorphism.
Methadone, an opioid analgesic, is used clinically in pain therapy as well as for substitution therapy in opioid addiction. It has a large interindividual variability in response and a narrow therapeutic index. Genetic polymorphisms in genes coding for methadone-metabolizing enzymes, transporter proteins (p-glycoprotein; P-gp), and mu-opioid receptors may explain part of the observed interindividual variation in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of methadone. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 2B6 have been identified as the main CYP isoforms involved in methadone metabolism. Methadone is a P-gp substrate, and, although there are inconsistent reports, ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms also contribute slightly to the interindividual variability of methadone kinetics and influence dose requirements. Genetic polymorphism is the cause of high interindividual variability of methadone blood concentrations for a given dose; for example, in order to obtain methadone plasma concentrations of 250 ng/mL, doses of racemic methadone as low as 55 mg/day or as high as 921 mg/day can be required in a 70-kg patient without any co-medication. The clinician must be aware of the pharmacokinetic properties and pharmacological interactions of methadone in order to personalize methadone administration. In the future, pharmacogenetics, at a limited level, can also be expected to facilitate individualized methadone therapy.
