The Pharmacogenetics Laboratory of the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the American University of Beirut Faculty of Medicine.
The pharmacogenetics (PGx) laboratory at the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the American University of Beirut Faculty of Medicine was established in October 2007. Several projects on the genetic polymorphisms of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters with treatment of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiac diseases and cancers are ongoing. We have been applying the 'candidate gene' PGx approach, and recently started using higher throughput analyses. The more recent research projects are geared towards performing more extensive genotyping and including bigger and more representative population samples such as by developing research registries and prospectively following up patients. Furthermore, many technologies and research applications, such as next-generation sequencing and pharmacoepigenetics that complement and enhance PGx research and applications, are being actively pursued.
