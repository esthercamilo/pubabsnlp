Community Dissemination in a Tribal Health Setting: A Pharmacogenetics Case Study.
Alaska Native and American Indian (AN/AI) people experience a disproportionate burden of health disparities in the United States. Including AN/AI people in pharmacogenetic research offers an avenue to address these health disparities, however the dissemination of pharmacogenetic research results in the community context can be a challenging task. In this paper, we describe a case-study that explores the preferences of AN/AI community members regarding pharmacogenetic research results dissemination. Results were presented as a PowerPoint presentation at the 2016 Alaska Native Health Research Forum (Forum). An audience response system and discussion groups were used to gather feedback from participants. Descriptive statistics were used to assess attendee understanding of the presentation content. Thematic analysis was used to analyze discussion group data. Forum attendees needed time to work through the concept of pharmacogenetics and looked for ways pharmacogenetics could apply to their daily life. Attendees found pharmacogenetics interesting, but wanted a simple description of pharmacogenetics. Community members were optimistic about the potential benefit pharmacogenetic medicine could have in the delivery of health care and expressed excitement this research was taking place. Researchers were urged to communicate throughout the study, not just end research results, to the community. Furthermore, attendees insisted their providers stay informed of research results that may have an impact on health care delivery. Conversational forms of dissemination are recommended when disseminating pharmacogenetic research results at the community level.
