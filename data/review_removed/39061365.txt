Co-Occurring Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (<i>MTHFR</i>) rs1801133 and rs1801131 Genotypes as Associative Genetic Modifiers of Clinical Severity in Rett Syndrome.
Remethylation disorders such as 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (<i>MTHFR</i>) deficiency reduce the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. The resulting hyperhomocysteinemia can lead to serious neurological consequences and multisystem toxicity. The role of <i>MTHFR</i> genotypes has not been investigated in patients with Rett Syndrome (RTT). In this study, we sought to assess the impact of co-occurring <i>MTHFR</i> genotypes on symptom profiles in RTT.
