Pharmacogenetics of pemetrexed combination therapy in lung cancer: pathway analysis reveals novel toxicity associations.
Identification of polymorphisms that influence pemetrexed tolerability could lead to individualised treatment regimens and improve quality of life. Twenty-eight polymorphisms within eleven candidate genes were genotyped using the Illumina Human Exome v1.1 BeadChip and tested for their association with the clinical outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma patients receiving pemetrexed/platinum doublet chemotherapy (n=136). GGH rs11545078 was associated with a reduced incidence of grade ⩾3 toxicity within the first four cycles of therapy (odds ratio (OR) 0.25, P=0.018), as well as reduced grade ⩾3 haematological toxicity (OR 0.13, P=0.048). DHFR rs1650697 conferred an increased risk of grade ⩾3 toxicity (OR 2.14, P=0.034). Furthermore, FOLR3 rs61734430 was associated with an increased likelihood of disease progression at mid-treatment radiological evaluation (OR 4.05, P=0.023). Polymorphisms within SLC19A1 (rs3788189, rs1051298 and rs914232) were associated with overall survival. This study confirms previous pharmacogenetic associations and identifies novel markers of pemetrexed toxicity.
