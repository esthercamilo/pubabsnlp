<i>In vitro</i> Differentiation of Human iPSC-derived Cardiovascular Progenitor Cells (iPSC-CVPCs).
Induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiovascular progenitor cells (iPSC-CVPCs) provide an unprecedented platform for examining the molecular underpinnings of cardiac development and disease etiology, but also have great potential to play pivotal roles in the future of regenerative medicine and pharmacogenomic studies. Biobanks like iPSCORE ( Stacey <i>et al.</i>, 2013 ; Panopoulos <i>et al.</i>, 2017 ), which contain iPSCs generated from hundreds of genetically and ethnically diverse individuals, are an invaluable resource for conducting these studies. Here, we present an optimized, cost-effective and highly standardized protocol for large-scale derivation of human iPSC-CVPCs using small molecules and purification using metabolic selection. We have successfully applied this protocol to derive iPSC-CVPCs from 154 different iPSCORE iPSC lines obtaining large quantities of highly pure cardiac cells. An important component of our protocol is Cell confluency estimates (ccEstimate), an automated methodology for estimating the time when an iPSC monolayer will reach 80% confluency, which is optimal for initiating iPSC-CVPC derivation, and enables the protocol to be readily used across iPSC lines with different growth rates. Moreover, we showed that cellular heterogeneity across iPSC-CVPCs is due to varying proportions of two distinct cardiac cell types: cardiomyocytes (CMs) and epicardium-derived cells (EPDCs), both of which have been shown to have a critical function in heart regeneration. This protocol eliminates the need of iPSC line-to-line optimization and can be easily adapted and scaled to high-throughput studies or to generate large quantities of cells suitable for regenerative medicine applications.
