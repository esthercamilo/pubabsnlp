<i>CYP2C19</i> genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy: promises and pitfalls.
Pharmacogenetic variants can alter the mechanism of action (pharmacodynamic gene variants) or kinetic processes such as absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (pharmacokinetic gene variants). Many initial successes in precision medicine occurred in the context of genes encoding the cytochromes P450 (CYP enzymes). CYP2C19 activates the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel, and polymorphisms in the <i>CYP2C19</i> gene are known toÂ alter the outcome for patients taking clopidogrel in the context of cardiovascular disease. <i>CYP2C19</i> loss-of-function alleles are specifically associated with increased risk for coronary stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients taking clopidogrel following percutaneous coronary intervention. We explore successes and challenges encountered as the clinical and scientific communities advance <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping in the context of routine patient care.
