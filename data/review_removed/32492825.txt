Failure of Achieving Tacrolimus Target Blood Concentration Might Be Avoided by a Wide Genotyping of Transplanted Patients: Evidence from a Retrospective Study.
Precise tacrolimus treatment in transplanted patients is achieved in the clinical setting by performing therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and consequently adjusting therapy. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the variability in tacrolimus blood levels throughout 2 years of observation in 75 transplanted patients and to investigate if tacrolimus blood levels correlate with presence of genetic polymorphisms, thus modifying tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. CYP3A5*1 (G6986A), CYP3A4*1B (A392G), CYP3A4*22, ABCB1 (C3435T; C1236T; G2677A/T), SLCO1B1 (T521C), polymorphisms were analyzed. Based on the effect of their genotypes, patients were stratified into 5 groups: (1) reduced tacrolimus metabolism (RM), (2) increased metabolism (IM), (3) transporters polymorphisms (TM), (4) metabolism and transporter polymorphisms (AM) and (5) no mutations (Wild Type, WT). The percentage of the samples out of therapeutic range was significantly higher in the IM group than in the WT group (<i>p</i> = 0.001), as well as compared to the TM group (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Only IM pattern (<i>p</i> = 0.015) resulted as an independent predictor of number of tacrolimus blood levels out of therapeutic range. RM pattern (<i>p</i> = 0.006) was inversely related to the administered dose. Therefore, genotyping could become a standard practice before tacrolimus prescription thus decreasing side effects, increasing efficacy and reducing the economic burden for the national health system.
