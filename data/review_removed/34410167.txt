Pharmacogenomics variants are associated with BMI differences between individuals with bipolar and other psychiatric disorders.
<b>Aim:</b> Regardless of the plethora of next-generation sequencingÂ studies in the field of pharmacogenomics (PGx), the potential effect of covariate variables on PGx response within deeply phenotyped cohorts remains unexplored. <b>Materials & methods:</b> We explored with advanced statistical methods the potential influence of BMI, as a covariate variable, on PGx response in a Greek cohort with psychiatric disorders. <b>Results:</b> Nine PGx variants within <i>UGT1A6, SLC22A4, GSTP1</i>, <i>CYP4B1</i>, <i>CES1</i>, <i>SLC29A3</i> and <i>DPYD</i> were associated with altered BMI in different psychiatric disorder groups. Carriers of rs2070959 (<i>UGT1A6</i>), rs199861210 (<i>SLC29A3</i>) and rs2297595 (<i>DPYD</i>) were also characterized by significant changes in the mean BMI, depending on the presence of psychiatric disorders. <b>Conclusion:</b> Specific PGx variants are significantly associated with BMI in a Greek cohort with psychiatric disorders.
