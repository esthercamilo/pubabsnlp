Clinical Utility and Economic Impact of CYP2D6 Genotyping.
Pharmacogenetics examines an individual's genetic makeup to help predict the safety and efficacy of medications. Practical application optimizes treatment selection to decrease the failure rate of medications and improve clinical outcomes. Lack of efficacy is costly due to adverse drug reactions and increased hospital stays. Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolizes roughly 25% of all drugs. Detecting variants that cause altered CYP2D6 enzymatic activity identifies patients at risk of adverse drug reactions or therapeutic failure with standard dosages of medications metabolized by CYP2D6. This article discusses the clinical application of pharmacogenetics to improve care and decrease costs.
