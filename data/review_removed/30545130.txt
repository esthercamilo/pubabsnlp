The 9th traditional biannual conference on Systems Medicine, Personalised Health &amp; Therapy-"The Odyssey from Hope to Practice", inspired by the Greek mythology, was a call to search for practical solutions in cardio-metabolic diseases and cancer, to resolve and overcome the obstacles in modern medicine by creating more interactions among disciplines, as well as between academic and industrial research, directed towards an effective 'roadmap' for personalised health and therapy.
