The <i>Cyp2b6 Gene</i> Polymorphism and Phenotypic Correlation of Efavirenz-Based Combination Therapy Among the Niger Delta Ethnic Population: Implications in Modern Pharmacogenomics.
DNA polymorphism describes the difference between individuals, groups, or ethnicities, races, etc., in terms of their DNA sequences or phenotypes as relates to drug metabolism. Using predictive genotyping of drug-metabolizing genes, we can develop individuals' drug therapies that are less toxic and more effective. The main aim of the study was to evaluate genotype-phenotype-based correlation and incidence of genetic polymorphism of efavirenz blood levels among HIV/AIDS patients of the Niger Delta population.
