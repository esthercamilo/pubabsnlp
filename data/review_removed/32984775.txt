Precision Pharmacotherapy: Integrating Pharmacogenomics into Clinical Pharmacy Practice.
Precision pharmacotherapy encompasses the use of therapeutic drug monitoring; evaluation of liver and renal function, genomics, and environmental and lifestyle exposures; and analysis of other unique patient or disease characteristics to guide drug selection and dosing. This paper articulates real-world clinical applications of precision pharmacotherapy, focusing exclusively on the emerging field of clinical pharmacogenomics. This field is evolving rapidly, and clinical pharmacists now play an invaluable role in the clinical implementation, education, and research applications of pharmacogenomics. This paper provides an overview of the evolution of pharmacogenomics in clinical pharmacy practice, together with recommendations on how the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) can support the advancement of clinical pharmacogenomics implementation, education, and research. Commonalities among successful clinical pharmacogenomics implementation and education programs are identified, with recommendations for how ACCP can leverage and advance these common themes. Opportunities are also provided to support the research needed to move the practice and application of pharmacogenomics forward.
