AMH type II receptor and AMH gene polymorphisms are not associated with ovarian reserve, response, or outcomes in ovarian stimulation.
Genetic variation may influence women's response to ovarian stimulation therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate any effects of genetic variants in the anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) and AMH type II receptor genes on ovarian response/treatment outcomes and on current markers of ovarian reserve in individuals undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment.
