Genetic Variability of CYP4F2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and ACE in the Chinese Yi Population.
Genetic polymorphisms of very important pharmacogenes (VIP) are a significant factor contributing to inter-individual variability in drug therapy. The purpose of this study was to identify significantly different loci in the Yi population and to enrich their pharmacogenomic information. 54 VIP variants were selected from the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) and genotyped in 200 Yi individuals. Then, we compared their genotype distribution between the Yi population and the other 26 populations using the Ï‡<sup>2</sup> test. Compared with the other 26 populations, the genotype frequencies of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2108622 (CYP4F2), rs1065852 (CYP2D6), rs2070676 (CYP2E1), and rs4291 (ACE), had significant differences in the Yi population. For example, the TT genotype frequency of rs2108622 (8.1%) was higher than that of African populations, and the AA genotype frequency of rs1065852 (27.3%) was higher than that of other populations except East Asians. We also found that the Yi populations differed the least from East Asians and the most from Africans. Furthermore, the differences in these variants might be related to the effectiveness and toxicity risk of using warfarin, iloperidone, cisplatin cyclophosphamide, and other drugs in the Yi population. Our data complement the pharmacogenomic information of the Yi population and provide theoretical guidance for their personalized treatment.
