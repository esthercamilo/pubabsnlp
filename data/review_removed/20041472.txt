Missense polymorphisms in three oxidative-stress enzymes (GSTP1, SOD2, and GPX1) and dyskinesias in Russian psychiatric inpatients from Siberia.
Neuronal degeneration due to oxidative stress (OS) has been proposed as a mechanism for tardive dyskinesia (TD) pathogenesis. Cellular defense mechanisms against OS may involve detoxification enzymes (e.g., glutathione peroxidase-1, GPX1; superoxide dismutase-2, SOD2 [also commonly known as MnSOD]; and glutathione S-transferase P1, GSTP1). Several pharmacogenetic studies have examined TD and OS in different ethnic groups, but not in Russians. Here we report the association between orofaciolingual (TDof) and limb-truncal dyskinesias (TDlt) and polymorphisms of GSTP1 (Ile105Val), MnSOD (Ala-9Val), and GPX1 (Pro197Leu) genes in 146 Russian inpatients from Siberia. We applied AIMS instrument to rate dyskinesias. Two-part model analyses, logistic and multivariate parametric regressions were applied to assess the effects of different variables (e.g., genotype, age, gender, and medication use). Our analyses do not suggest that Pro197Leu (GPX1) is associated with TD. However, our analyses suggest that the 105Val-allele of Ile105Val (GSTP1) may be associated with a lower risk and a severity of TDof and TDlt and that Ile105Val pharmacogenetics may be different in Slavonic Caucasians from that in American Caucasians. Furthermore, we find evidence for an association between Ala-9Val (MnSOD) and TDof, but not TDlt. Subject to further replication, our findings extend the available knowledge on the pharmacogenetics of TD and oxidative stress.
