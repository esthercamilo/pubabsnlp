GLCCI1 Polymorphism rs37973 and Response to Treatment of Asthma With Inhaled Corticosteroids.
The response to asthma treatment is highly variable, and having pharmacogenetic markers that predict response to treatment would bring us one step closer to personalized treatment. Genome-wide association studies have shown that polymorphisms in GLCCI1 could be associated with the response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in asthma patients.
