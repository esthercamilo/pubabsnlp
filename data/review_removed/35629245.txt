Evaluation of Pharmacogenetics of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Drug Efflux Transporter in Renal Transplants Receiving Immunosuppressants.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, such as <i>CYP3A4,</i> and <i>CYP3A5</i>, P450 oxidoreductase (POR), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha), and drug transporter (ABCB1) were observed to influence concentrations of immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) and outcomes in renal transplants. We carried out the present study to evaluate the prevalence and impact of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in adult renal transplants. SNPs were evaluated using commercial TaqMan<sup>Â®</sup> assays. Serum drug concentrations were estimated using immunoassays. One hundred and forty-six patients were recruited. SNPs in <i>CYP3A5*3</i> were significantly associated with greater dose-adjusted cyclosporine and tacrolimus concentrations. SNPs in <i>POR*28</i> were observed with significantly lower dose-adjusted concentrations, particularly with cyclosporine and tacrolimus. <i>ABCB1</i> homozygous polymorphisms were observed with significantly lower time spent in the therapeutic range with cyclosporine and everolimus/sirolimus. Cyclosporine was observed in a significantly greater proportion of patients with elevated GGT, and SNPs in <i>PPAR-alpha</i> were significantly associated with an increased risk of this adverse event. Hypertriglyceridemia with everolimus was significantly associated with <i>POR*28</i> polymorphisms. There is a need to validate the influence of these SNPs in a prospective study and develop an algorithm predicting the achievement of target concentrations.
