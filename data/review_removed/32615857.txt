The influence of coffee intake and genetics on adenosine pathway in rheumatoid arthritis.
<b>Aim:</b> We studied the influence of coffee consumption on the therapeutic effect of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) sorted according to <i>ADORA2A</i> genotypes. <b>Patients & methods:</b> 82 RA patients were dichotomized according to caffeine intake with a threshold of 700 mg/week. Disease activity score 28 (DAS28) was applied (>3.2: high; <3.2: low or remission). Patients were genotyped using quantitative PCR allelic discrimination. <b>Results:</b> We found significantly higher risk of RA in patients with higher caffeine intake and the CT genotype of <i>ADOARA2A</i> rs2298383, rs3761422 and rs2267076 SNPs. The CC genotype of <i>ADORA2A</i> rs2236624 SNP in patients with lower caffeine intake treated with MTX is significantly protective. <b>Conclusion:</b><i>ADORA2A</i> genotypes and coffee intake influence risk of RA and efficacy of it MTX treatment.
