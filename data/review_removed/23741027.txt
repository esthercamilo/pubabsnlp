Mutational analysis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs): procedural approach for diagnostic purposes.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors in the digestive tract characterized, in the majority of cases, by activating mutations in the KIT (v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) or PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor, alpha polypeptide) genes. Mutations affecting these tyrosine kinase receptors are also responsible for the mechanisms of primary and secondary drug resistance during the treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We performed mutational analysis to evaluate the pharmacotherapy susceptibility of GISTs, adopting a comprehensive procedural approach, in order to optimize the identification of mutations that may result in cellular resistance to conventional therapy.
