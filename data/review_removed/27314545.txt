CYP3A pharmacogenetics and tacrolimus disposition in adult heart transplant recipients.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A polymorphisms are associated with variable CYP3A metabolizing enzyme activity and tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. We sought to determine the singular and combined impact of CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 variants on tacrolimus drug disposition in adult heart transplant recipients.
