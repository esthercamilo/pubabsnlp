Pharmacoepigenetics of hypertension: genome-wide methylation analysis of responsiveness to four classes of antihypertensive drugs using a double-blind crossover study design.
Essential hypertension remains the leading risk factor of global disease burden, but its treatment goals are often not met. We investigated whether DNA methylation is associated with antihypertensive responses to a diuretic, a beta-blocker, a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin receptor antagonist. In addition, since we previously showed an SNP at the transcription start site (TSS) of the catecholamine biosynthesis-related <i>ACY3</i> gene to associate with blood pressure (BP) response to beta-blockers, we specifically analysed the association of methylation sites close to the <i>ACY3</i> TSS with BP responses to beta-blockers. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study between leukocyte DNA methylation and BP responses to antihypertensive monotherapies in two hypertensive Finnish cohorts: the GENRES (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03276598; amlodipine 5 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, or losartan 50 mg daily) and the LIFE-Fin studies (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00338260; atenolol 50 mg or losartan 50 mg daily). The monotherapy groups consisted of approximately 200 individuals each. We identified 64 methylation sites to suggestively associate (P < 1E-5) with either systolic or diastolic BP responses to a particular study drug in GENRES. These associations did not replicate in LIFE-Fin . Three methylation sites close to the <i>ACY3</i> TSS were associated with systolic BP responses to bisoprolol in GENRES but not genome-wide significantly (P < 0.05). No robust associations between DNA methylation and BP responses to four different antihypertensive drugs were identified. However, the findings on the methylation sites close to the <i>ACY3</i> TSS may support the role of <i>ACY3</i> genetic and epigenetic variation in BP response to bisoprolol.
