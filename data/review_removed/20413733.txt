Combined influence of LDLR and HMGCR sequence variation on lipid-lowering response to simvastatin.
Although statins are efficacious for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, there is wide interindividual variation in response. We tested the extent to which combined effects of common alleles of LDLR and HMGCR can contribute to this variability.
