CYP450 2D6 and 2C19 genotypes in ADHD: not related with treatment resistance but with over-representation of 2C19 ultra-metabolizers.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) is a major enzyme system involved in drug metabolism as well as regulation of brain function. Although individual variability in CYP enzymes have been studied in terms of personality traits and treatment effects, no study up to now evaluated CYP polymorphisms in children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We aimed to define the genetic profiles of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 relevant alleles in children with ADHD according to treatment status and compare the frequencies according to past results.
