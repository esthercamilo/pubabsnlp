Pharmacogenetics of glucocorticoid replacement could optimize the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Treatment is based on glucocorticoid replacement; however, interindividual variability in the glucocorticoid dose required to achieve adequate hormonal control has been observed.
