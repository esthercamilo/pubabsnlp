Identification of pharmacogenetic variants from large scale next generation sequencing data in the Saudi population.
It is well documented that drug responses are related to Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) characteristics of individual patients. Several studies have identified genetic variability in pharmacogenes, that are either directly responsible for or are associated with ADME, giving rise to individualized treatments. Our objective was to provide a comprehensive overview of pharmacogenetic variation in the Saudi population. We mined next generation sequencing (NGS) data from 11,889 unrelated Saudi nationals, to determine the presence and frequencies of known functional SNP variants in 8 clinically relevant pharmacogenes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, CYP4F2, VKORC1, DPYD, TPMT and NUDT15), recommended by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), and collectively identified 82 such star alleles. Functionally significant pharmacogenetic variants were prevalent especially in CYP genes (excluding CYP3A5), with 10-44.4% of variants predicted to be inactive or to have decreased activity. In CYP3A5, inactive alleles (87.5%) were the most common. Only 1.8%, 0.7% and 0.7% of NUDT15, TPMT and DPYD variants respectively, were predicted to affect gene activity. In contrast, VKORC1 was found functionally, to be highly polymorphic with 53.7% of Saudi individuals harboring variants predicted to result in decreased activity and 31.3% having variants leading to increased metabolic activity. Furthermore, among the 8 pharmacogenes studied, we detected six rare variants with an aggregated frequency of 1.1%, that among several other ethnicities, were uniquely found in Saudi population. Similarly, within our cohort, the 8 pharmacogenes yielded forty-six novel variants predicted to be deleterious. Based upon our findings, 99.2% of individuals from the Saudi population carry at least one actionable pharmacogenetic variant.
