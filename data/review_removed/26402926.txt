Pharmacogenetics in the Development of Lipid Lowering Medications: Lomitapide & Mipomersen in Clinical Practice.
The familial hypercholesterolemias (FH) are a group of undertreated genetically inherited disorders of lipid metabolism that lead to severely elevated cholesterol levels and early onset cardiovascular disease. Aggressive lifestyle modifications and lipid-lowering medications such as statins and bile acid sequestrants are the backbone of current treatment. Despite these interventions, homozygous FH (HoFH) patients are unable to reach LDL-C targets and remain at significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Recently, two novel lipid-lowering medications, lomitapide and mipomersen, have been approved for the treatment of HoFH.
