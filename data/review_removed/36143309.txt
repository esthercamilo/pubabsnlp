Possible Use of Minocycline in Adjunction to Intranasal Esketamine for the Management of Difficult to Treat Depression following Extensive Pharmacogenomic Testing: Two Case Reports.
The advent of intra-nasal esketamine (ESK), one of the first so called <i>fast-acting antidepressant</i>, promises to revolutionize the management of treatment resistant depression (TRD). This NMDA receptor antagonist has proven to be rapidly effective in the short- and medium-term course of the illness, revealing its potential in targeting <i>response</i> in TRD. Although many TRD ESK responders are able to achieve remission, a considerable portion of them undergo a metamorphosis of their depression into different clinical presentations, characterized by instable responses and high recurrence rates that can be considered closer to the concept of <i>Difficult to Treat Depression</i> (DTD) than to TRD. The management of these DTD patients usually requires a further complex multidisciplinary approach and can benefit from the valuable contribution of new personalized medicine tools such as therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenetics. Despite this, these patients usually come with long and complex previous treatments history and, often, advanced and sophisticated ongoing pharmacological schemes that can make the finding of new alternative options to face the current recurrences extremely challenging. In this paper, we describe two DTD patients-already receiving intranasal ESK but showing an instable course-who were clinically stabilized by the association with minocycline, a semisynthetic second-generation tetracycline with known and promising antidepressant properties.
