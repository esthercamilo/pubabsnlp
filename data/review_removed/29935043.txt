The pediatric acenocoumarol dosing algorithm: the Children Anticoagulation and Pharmacogenetics Study.
Essentials A pediatric pharmacogenetic dosing algorithm for acenocoumarol has not yet been developed. We conducted a multicenter retrospective follow-up study in children in the Netherlands. Body surface area and indication explained 45.0% of the variability in dose requirement. Adding the genotypes of VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP2C18 to the algorithm increased this to 61.8%.
