Impact of Platelet Endothelial Aggregation Receptor-1 Genotypes on Platelet Reactivity and Early Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Treated With Aspirin and Clopidogrel.
The genetic determinants of response to clopidogrel and aspirin are incompletely characterized. Recently, PEAR1 (platelet endothelial aggregation receptor-1) rs12041331 polymorphism has been shown to influence the platelet reactivity, but its impact on cardiovascular outcomes remains unclear in patients treated with antiplatelet agents.
