Evaluation of the Veterans Affairs Pharmacogenomic Testing for Veterans (PHASER) clinical program at initial test sites.
<b>Aim:</b> The first Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle for the Veterans Affairs Pharmacogenomic Testing for Veterans pharmacogenomic clinical testing program is described. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Surveys evaluating implementation resources and processes were distributed to implementation teams, providers, laboratory and health informatics staff. Survey responses were mapped to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs to identify implementation barriers. The Expert Recommendation for Implementing Change strategies were used to address implementation barriers. <b>Results:</b> Survey response rate was 23-73% across personnel groups at six Veterans Affairs sites. Nine Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs were most salient implementation barriers. Program revisions addressed these barriers using the Expert Recommendation for Implementing Change strategies related to three domains. <b>Conclusion:</b> Beyond providing free pharmacogenomic testing, additional implementation barriers need to be addressed for improved program uptake.
