The role of pharmacogenomics in precision mental health care.
Pharmacogenomics is the study of how genes affect a person's response to medications. This science has given rise to the practice of "precision health care," which combines pharmacology (the study of medication) and genomics (the study of genes and their functions) to inform a more personalized approach. Related considerations include which medications to prescribe to different individuals and what doses will have the most therapeutic effects (with the fewest side effects). A case of recalcitrant depression and anxiety (in the context of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disease) serves as the basis for discussion of psychopharmacogenomics to inform a more effective treatment approach for psychiatric symptoms. A contemporary understanding of neurobiology and neuropathology, enhanced by genetic and genomic information, supports new models for diagnosis and precision treatment of commonly recurring mental health problems.
