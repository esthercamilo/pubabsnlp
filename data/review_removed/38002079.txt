Pharmacogenetic Association between Allelic Variants of the Autophagy-Related Genes and Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Treatment Response in Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of late-onset blindness in elderly. The occurrence and development of AMD is a multifactorial complex process where autophagy plays an important role. The first-line drugs for neovascular AMD (nAMD) are inhibitors of VEGF, with up to 30% of patients having an incomplete response to treatment. Genetic factors may influence the response to anti-VEGF therapy and explain treatment outcome variability. We aimed to estimate the role of polymorphic markers of the <i>MTOR</i> (rs1064261, rs1057079, rs11121704, rs2295080), <i>SQSTM1</i> (rs10277), <i>ULK1</i> (rs11246867, rs3088051), <i>MAP1LC3A</i> (rs73105013) and <i>ATG5</i> (rs573775) genes in the development of nAMD and the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy response.
