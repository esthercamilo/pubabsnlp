PharmVIP: A Web-Based Tool for Pharmacogenomic Variant Analysis and Interpretation.
The increasing availability of next generation sequencing (NGS) for personal genomics could promote pharmacogenomics (PGx) discovery and application. However, current tools for analysis and interpretation of pharmacogenomic variants from NGS data are inadequate, as none offer comprehensive analytic functions in a simple, web-based platform. In addition, no tools exist to analyze human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes for determining potential risks of immune-mediated adverse drug reaction (IM-ADR). We describe PharmVIP, a web-based PGx tool, for one-stop comprehensive analysis and interpretation of genome-wide variants obtained from NGS platforms. PharmVIP comprises three main interpretation modules covering analyses of pharmacogenes involved in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and IM-ADR. The Guideline module provides Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) drug guideline recommendations based on the translation of genotypic data in genes having guidelines. The HLA module reports HLA genotypes, potential adverse drug reactions, and the relevant drug guidelines. The Pharmacogenes module is employed for prioritizing variants according to variant effect on gene function. Detailed, customizable reports are provided as exportable files and as an interactive web version. PharmVIP is a new integrated NGS workflow for the PGx community to facilitate discovery and clinical application.
