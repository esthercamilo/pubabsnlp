Functional Genomics.
Functional genomics encompasses diverse disciplines in molecular biology and bioinformatics to comprehend the blueprint, regulation, and expression of genetic elements that define the physiology of an organism. The deluge of sequencing data in the postgenomics era has demanded the involvement of computer scientists and mathematicians to create algorithms, analytical software, and databases for the storage, curation, and analysis of biological big data. In this chapter, we discuss on the concept of functional genomics in the context of systems biology and provide examples of its application in human genetic disease studies, molecular crop improvement, and metagenomics for antibiotic discovery. An overview of transcriptomics workflow and experimental considerations is also introduced. Lastly, we present an in-house case study of transcriptomics analysis of an aromatic herbal plant to understand the effect of elicitation on the biosynthesis of volatile organic compounds.
