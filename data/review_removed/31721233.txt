Precision medicine, agriculture, and genome editing: science and ethics.
The era of precision medicine has generated advances in various fields of science and medicine with the potential for a paradigm shift in healthcare delivery that will ultimately lead to an individualized approach to medicine. Such timely topics were explored in 2018 at a workshop held at the Third International Conference on One Medicine One Science (iCOMOS), in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A broad range of scientists and regulatory experts provided detailed insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with precision medicine and gene editing. There was a general consensus that advances in studying the genomic traits driving differential pharmacogenomics will undoubtedly enhance individualized treatments for a wide variety of diseases. Ethical considerations, societal implications, approaches for prioritizing safe and secure use of treatment modalities, and the advent of high-throughput computing and analysis of large, complex datasets were discussed. Large biobanks, such as the All of Us Research Program and the Veterans Affairs Million Veterans Program, can aid studies of various conditions in massive cohorts of patients. As the applications of precision medicine continue to mature, the full potential and promise of these individualized approaches will continue to yield important advances in transplant medicine, oncology, public health, agriculture, pharmacology, and bioinformatics.
