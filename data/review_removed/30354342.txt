Druggability of Coronary Artery Disease Risk Loci.
Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple loci associated with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, but only a few of these loci are current targets for on-market medications. To identify drugs suitable for repurposing and their targets, we created 2 unique pipelines integrating public data on 49 coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction-genome-wide association studies loci, drug-gene interactions, side effects, and chemical interactions.
