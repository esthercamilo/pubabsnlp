Current practices for DNA sample collection and storage in the pharmaceutical industry, and potential areas for harmonization: perspective of the I-PWG.
Collection and storage of DNA samples in clinical drug development programs are an important investment for the pharmaceutical industry to allow efficient evaluation of observed variability in drug response. To enable collection and future use of samples, individual companies must define (i) processes to collect specimens worldwide, (ii) whether collection is optional or mandatory, (iii) conditions and duration of sample storage, (iv) whether research data can be returned to subjects, and (v) other logistical aspects. To determine current industry practices for collection and storage of these samples, the Industry Pharmacogenomics Working Group (I-PWG) conducted a survey of the industry (21 respondents) to identify areas of commonality and divergence. On the basis of the survey results, the I-PWG details areas of focus for harmonization of the industry's sample collection practices. A more unified approach would facilitate DNA sample collection, thereby contributing to the advancement of personalized medicine and more efficient development of safe and effective drugs.
