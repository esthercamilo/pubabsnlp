Pharmacogenetic analyses of variations of measures of cardiovascular risk in Alzheimer's dementia.
Neurodegeneration affects blood pressure variations, while renal function and cerebral perfusion are impaired by vascular risk factors. This study was aimed to estimate variations of measures of cardiovascular risk in Alzheimer's dementia by pharmacogenetic analyses of the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and statins.
