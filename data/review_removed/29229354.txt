Comparative clinical trial of the variability factors of the exposure indices used for the drug monitoring of two tacrolimus formulations in kidney transplant recipients.
Several studies found differences in tacrolimus whole blood trough levels (C0) or area-under-the curve (AUC) between the twice-daily (Tac-BID) and once-daily (Tac-OD) formulations given to kidney transplant recipients at equal doses. As C0 is widely used as a surrogate of the AUC for individual dose adjustment, this study investigated the correlation and proportionality between C0 and the 24h-AUC, depending on the formulation, time post-transplantation, pharmacogenetics traits and other individual characteristics.
