Engaging pharmacogenomics in pain management and opioid selection.
Opioid misuse and mismanagement has been a public health crisis for several years. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) has been proposed as another tool to enhance opioid selection and optimization, with recent studies demonstrating successful implementation and outcomes. However, broad engagement with PGx for opioid management is presently limited. The purpose of this article is to highlight a series of barriers to PGx implementation within the specific context of opioid management. Areas of advancement needed for more robust pharmacogenomic engagement with opioids will be discussed, including clinical and economic research needs, education and training needs, policy and public health considerations, as well as legal and ethical issues. Continuing efforts to address these issues may help to further operationalize PGx toward improving opioid use.
