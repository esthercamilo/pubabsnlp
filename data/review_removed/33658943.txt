Expansion of Knowledge on OCT1 Variant Activity <i>In Vitro</i> and <i>In Vivo</i> Using Oct1/2<sup>-/-</sup> Mice.
The role of organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) in humans is gaining attention as data emerges regarding its role in physiology, drug exposure, and drug response. OCT1 variants with decreased <i>in vitro</i> function correlate well with altered exposure of multiple OCT1 substrates in variant carriers. In the current research, we investigate mechanisms behind activity of OCT1 variants <i>in vitro</i> by generating cell lines expressing known OCT1 variants and quantifying membrane OCT1 protein expression with corresponding OCT1 activity and kinetics. Oct knockout mice have provided additional insight into the role of Oct1 in the liver and have reproduced effects of altered OCT1 activity observed in the clinic. To assess the complex effect of Oct1 depletion on pharmacokinetics of prodrug proguanil and its active moiety cycloguanil, both of which are OCT1 substrates, Oct1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were used. Decreased membrane expression of OCT1 was demonstrated for all variant cell lines, although activity was substrate-dependent, as reported previously. Lack of change in activity for OCT1*2 resulted in increased intrinsic activity per pmol of OCT1 protein, particularly for sumatriptan but also for proguanil and cycloguanil. Similar to that reported in humans with decreased OCT1 function, systemic exposure of proguanil was minimally affected in Oct1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, proguanil liver partitioning and exposure decreased. Cycloguanil exposure decreased following proguanil administration in Oct1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, as did the systemic metabolite:parent ratio. When administered directly, systemic exposure of cycloguanil decreased slightly; however liver partitioning and exposure were decreased in Oct1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Unexpectedly, following proguanil administration, the metabolite ratio in the liver changed only minimally, and liver partitioning of cycloguanil was affected in Oct1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice to a lesser extent following proguanil administration than direct administration of cycloguanil. In conclusion, these <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> data offer additional complexity in understanding mechanisms of OCT1 variant activity as well as the effects of these variants <i>in vivo</i>. From cell lines, it is apparent that intrinsic activity is not directly related to OCT1 membrane expression. Additionally, in situations with a more complicated role of OCT1 in drug pharmacokinetics there is difficulty translating <i>in vivo</i> impact simply from intrinsic activity from cellular data.
