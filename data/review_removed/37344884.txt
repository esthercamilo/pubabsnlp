Whole genome sequencing across clinical trials identifies rare coding variants in GPR68 associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.
Dose-limiting toxicities significantly impact the benefit/risk profile of many drugs. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) in patients receiving drugs with dose-limiting toxicities can identify therapeutic hypotheses to prevent these toxicities. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common dose-limiting neurological toxicity of chemotherapies with no effective approach for prevention.
