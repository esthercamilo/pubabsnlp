Search and visualization of gene-drug-disease interactions for pharmacogenomics and precision medicine research using GeneDive.
Understanding the relationships between genes, drugs, and disease states is at the core of pharmacogenomics. Two leading approaches for identifying these relationships in medical literature are: human expert led manual curation efforts, and modern data mining based automated approaches. The former generates small amounts of high-quality data, and the latter offers large volumes of mixed quality data. The algorithmically extracted relationships are often accompanied by supporting evidence, such as, confidence scores, source articles, and surrounding contexts (excerpts) from the articles, that can be used as data quality indicators. Tools that can leverage these quality indicators to help the user gain access to larger and high-quality data are needed.
