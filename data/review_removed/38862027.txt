A second space age spanning omics, platforms and medicine across orbits.
The recent acceleration of commercial, private and multi-national spaceflight has created an unprecedented level of activity in low Earth orbit, concomitant with the largest-ever number of crewed missions entering space and preparations for exploration-class (lasting longer than one year) missions. Such rapid advancement into space from many new companies, countries and space-related entities has enabled a 'second space age'. This era is also poised to leverage, for the first time, modern tools and methods of molecular biology and precision medicine, thus enabling precision aerospace medicine for the crews. The applications of these biomedical technologies and algorithms are diverse, and encompass multi-omic, single-cell and spatial biology tools to investigate human and microbial responses to spaceflight. Additionally, they extend to the development of new imaging techniques, real-time cognitive assessments, physiological monitoring and personalized risk profiles tailored for astronauts. Furthermore, these technologies enable advancements in pharmacogenomics, as well as the identification of novel spaceflight biomarkers and the development of corresponding countermeasures. In this Perspective, we highlight some of the recent biomedical research from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, European Space Agency and other space agencies, and detail the entrance of the commercial spaceflight sector (including SpaceX, Blue Origin, Axiom and Sierra Space) into aerospace medicine and space biology, the first aerospace medicine biobank, and various upcoming missions that will utilize these tools to ensure a permanent human presence beyond low Earth orbit, venturing out to other planets and moons.
