Role of <i>THRB</i>, <i>ARG1</i>, and <i>ADRB2</i> Genetic Variants on Bronchodilators Response in Asthmatic Children.
<b><i>Background:</i></b> An interindividual variability in response to short-acting bronchodilator drugs (short-acting inhaled β2-agonists, SABA) exists and this is linked in part to genetic factors. The aim of this study was to verify the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of a previously studied gene (<i>ADRB2</i>) and of new candidate genes (<i>THRB</i> and <i>ARG1</i>) on the acute response to SABA in children with asthma. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> One hundred asthmatic children (mean age 9.6 ± 3.0 years, 77 boys) underwent allergological and lung function evaluations. Spirometry was performed before and after bronchodilation test (BD test). The <i>ADRB2</i> region containing the Arg16Gly (rs1042713) and Gln27Glu (rs1042714) variants were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, whereas <i>ARG1</i> rs2781659 (A>G) and <i>THRB</i> rs892940 (G>A) SNPs were genotyped by high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Seventy-seven percent of children developed asthma in the first 6 years of life. Allergic sensitization was observed in 92% (total immunoglobulin G: 529.8 ± 477. kU/L). All patients exhibited respiratory allergy: 43% has multiple respiratory, 22% to single respiratory, and 27% multiple respiratory and food allergies. Fifty four percent children showed positive BD response (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] > 12%). Presence of Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly genotypes in position 16 of <i>ADRB2</i> was significantly associated to a worse BD response (post-BD FEV1: 108.68% ± 15.62% in Arg/Arg vs. 101.86% ± 14.03% in Arg/Gly or Gly/Gly patients, <i>p</i> = 0.02). No significant association was found between spirometric parameters before and after BD for the other three examined SNPs. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The influence of genetic variability on responsiveness to drugs could become a key parameter to optimize a tailored therapy for young patients with asthma, especially if drug-resistance occurs.
