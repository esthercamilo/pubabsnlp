Development of an extensive workflow for comprehensive clinical pharmacogenomic profiling: lessons from a pilot study on 100 whole exome sequencing data.
This pilot study is aimed at implementing an approach for comprehensive clinical pharmacogenomics (PGx) profiling. Fifty patients with cardiovascular diseases and 50 healthy individuals underwent whole-exome sequencing. Data on 1800 PGx genes were extracted and analyzed through deep filtration separately. Theoretical drug induced phenoconversion was assessed for the patients, using sequence2script. In total, 4539 rare variants (including 115 damaging non-synonymous) were identified. Four publicly available PGx bioinformatics algorithms to assign PGx haplotypes were applied to nine selected very important pharmacogenes (VIP) and revealed a 45-70% concordance rate. To ensure availability of the results at point-of-care, actionable variants were stored in a web-hosted database and PGx-cards were developed for quick access and handed to the study subjects. While a comprehensive clinical PGx profile could be successfully extracted from WES data, available tools to interpret these data demonstrated inconsistencies that complicate clinical application.
