Validation of a multi-gene qPCR-based pharmacogenomics panel across major ethnic groups in Singapore and Indonesia.
<b>Aim:</b> The clinical utility of pharmacogenomics (PGx) has been gaining traction alongside growing evidence that adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have significant genetic associations. Nala PGx Core<sup>®</sup> is a multi-gene qPCR-based panel of 20 allele variants, comprising 18 SNPs and two <i>CYP2D6</i> copy number markers across four pharmacogenes - <i>CYP2C9</i>, <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>SLCO1B1</i>. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we validated the performance of Nala PGx Core<sup>®</sup> against benchmark methods, on the Singaporean and Indonesian populations. <b>Results & conclusion:</b> Nala PGx Core<sup>®</sup> demonstrated robust and accurate genotyping when compared with other established benchmarks. Furthermore, the panel successfully characterized alleles of clinical relevance, such as <i>CYP2D6*10</i> and <i>CYP2D6*36</i>, across major ethnic groups present of Singapore and Indonesia, suggesting its potential for adoption in clinical workflows regionally.
