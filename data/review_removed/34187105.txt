Prevalence of five pharmacologically most important <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i> allelic variants in the population from the Republic of Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The enzymes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily play a critical role in phase I drug metabolism. Among them, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are clinically important, as they can mediate severe toxicity, therapy failure, and increased susceptibility to cancer and other diseases caused by chemicals. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of pharmacologically most important allelic variants of the <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i> genes in the general population of the Republic of Srpska (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and to compare them with other populations. For this purpose we determined the genotype profile and allele frequency of 216 randomly selected healthy volunteers using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The prevalence of the <i>CYP2C9 *2</i> and <i>*3</i> alleles was 13.6 and 7.4 %, respectively. Based on these frequencies, of the 216 participants four (1.86 %) were predicted to be poor metabolisers, 78 (36.11 %) intermediate, and the remaining 134 (62.03 %) normal metabolisers. Based on the prevalence of <i>CYP2C19 *2</i> and <i>*17</i> variants - 16.2 and 20.4 %, respectively - nine (4.17 %) were predicted to be poor, 57 (26.39 %) rapid, and nine (4.17 %) ultra-rapid metabolisers. We found no significant differences in allele frequencies in our population and populations from other European countries. These findings suggest that genetically determined phenotypes of <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i> should be taken into consideration to minimise individual risk and improve benefits of drug therapy in the Republic of Srpska.
