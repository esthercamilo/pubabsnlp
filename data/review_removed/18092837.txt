Chemoprotective action of resveratrol and genistein from apoptosis induced in human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
Extensive research is being carried out to analyse the importance of plant products such as resveratrol and genistein, which are known to exert a variety of pharmacological effects. This study aims at evaluating the protective role of these compounds against the apoptosis induced in normal cells by cytotoxic anticancer agents such as cisplatin and mytomycin C during therapy. Despite the broad antineoplastic action of cisplatin and mitomycin C, their genotoxicity in normal cell might lead to the induction of secondary malignancies. Therefore, the problem of identifying plant compounds, which might exert protective action in normal cells, gains lot of significance. We have analyzed the chemoprotective effect of plant compounds on peripheral blood human lymphocytes when exposed to cisplatin and mitomycin C by pre-treating and post-treating them with resveratrol and genistein at 100 microM concentration Biochemical alterations occurring in many cells during apoptosis include loss of plasma membrane phospholipid asymmetry, DNA fragmentation, and activation of caspase-3, et cetera, and have been assessed. Fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometric techniques have clearly demonstrated that resveratrol and genistein are efficient in protecting lymphocytes undergoing DNA damage when exposed to cisplatin and mitomycin C and exerted their activity by reducing the caspase 3 expression. An interesting observation is that, these compounds offered their protective effect by reducing their apoptotic potential on membrane and nucleic acids against cytotoxic agents, cisplatin, and mitomycin C. These results suggest that resveratrol and genistein might be useful for risk assessments in advance of clinical trials and could be considered as a strong candidate in pharmacogenomics or nutriprotective arena.
