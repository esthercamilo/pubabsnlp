Curidium Medica, plc.
Curidium Medica, plc is a personalized medicine company intent on developing targeted medicines and their associated companion diagnostics to treat patients more effectively and safely. Through the use of its proprietary gene-expression analysis tool, Homomatrix<sup>®</sup>, Curidium aims to reveal different patient subgroups characterized by distinct underlying disease mechanisms. This is anticipated to lead to the identification of diagnostics to subclassify patients within heterogeneous disease populations and improved therapies for different patient subgroups, ultimately resulting in the development of personalized medicines using companion diagnostics and targeted treatments. The company's initial focus on diseases of the CNS has resulted in the identification of a blood diagnostic tool, PsychINDx™, which classifies patients with schizophrenia/bipolar disorder into four subgroups. PsychINDx may have the potential to improve the treatment of patients with schizophrenia/bipolar disorder. Curidium aims to continue to use this approach to improve patient treatments in a variety of therapeutic areas and heterogeneous diseases. The first such additional application using Homomatrix has been initiated within a strategic research alliance with Takeda (Osaka, Japan) in the area of major depressive disorder.
