[Pharmacogenetics of antipsychotics in schizophrenia].
There are no objective criterion of choice between the various antipsychotic treatments available in schizophrenia today. The final aim of the pharmacogenetic study of the efficacy and the tolerance of these treatments is the individual optimization of the drug treatments. Research in progress did not make it possible yet to highlight criteria usable in daily clinical practice. The assessment of larger cohorts, genetically homogeneous and prospectively evaluated should in the future make it possible to better predict the response to the treatment in particular in term of tolerance, to highlight new therapeutic targets and to better understand the mechanism of action of the current treatments.
