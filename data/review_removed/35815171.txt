Correlation of <i>1846G</i>><i>A</i> Polymorphism of <i>CYP2D6</i> Gene with Haloperidol Efficacy and Safety in Patients with Alcoholic Hallucinoses.
Previous studies have shown that haloperidol biotransformation occurs with participation of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme. The CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic, which may contribute to differences in its activity and in the haloperidol biotransformation rates across different individuals, resulting in variable drug efficacy and safety profiles.
