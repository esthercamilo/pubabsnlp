5'-nucleotidase cN-II emerges as a new predictive biomarker of response to gemcitabine/platinum combination chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.
A number of pharmacogenetic studies have been carried out in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to identify and characterize genes involved in chemotherapy activity. However, the results obtained so far are controversial and no reliable biomarker is currently used to predict clinical benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy, which represents the cornerstone of treatment of advanced NSCLC. This study investigated the expression levels of ERCC1 and of six genes (RRM1, RRM2, hENT1, dCK, cN-II and CDA) involved in gemcitabine metabolism in locally/advanced NSCLC patients treated with gemcitabine/platinum combination. Gene expression was assessed by quantitative-PCR in laser-microdissected specimens and correlated with tumor response. Frequency distribution of responses above and below the median expression level of biomarkers was compared using a two-sided Fisher's test. 5'-nucleotidase (cN-II) was the only gene differently expressed (<i>p</i> = 0.016) in the responders (complete/partial-response) compared to non-responders (stable/progressive disease). In the multivariate analysis, overexpression of this catabolic enzyme of gemcitabine remained a significant negative predictive factor. Patients with low cN-II had a modest trend toward increased survival, while both survival and progression-free survival were significantly longer in a more homogenous validation cohort of 40 advanced NSCLC (8.0 vs. 5.1 months, <i>p</i> = 0.026). Moreover, <i>in vitro</i> studies showed that silencing or pharmacological inhibition of cN-II increased the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine. This is the first study demonstrating the role of cN-II as a predictor of response to gemcitabine/platinum combinations in NSCLC. Its validation in prospective studies may improve clinical outcome of selected patients.
