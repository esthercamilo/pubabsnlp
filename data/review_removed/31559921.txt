Nanopore sequencing of the pharmacogene <i>CYP2D6</i> allows simultaneous haplotyping and detection of duplications.
<b>Aim:</b> Long read sequencing offers the promise of overcoming some of the challenges in accurate genotyping of complex genes, along with the advantage of straightforward variant phasing. We have established methods for sequencing and haplotyping of the whole <i>CYP2D6</i> gene using nanopore sequencing. <b>Materials and methods:</b> 32 samples covering various haplotypes including gene duplication were sequenced on the GridION platform. <b>Results:</b> Haplotypes of 52 alleles matched accurately to known star (*) allele subvariants, with the remaining 12 being assigned as new alleles, or new subvariants of known alleles. Duplicated alleles could be detected by analyzing the allelic balance. <b>Conclusion:</b> Nanopore sequencing of <i>CYP2D6</i> offers a high throughput method for accurate haplotyping, detection of new variants and determination of duplicated alleles.
