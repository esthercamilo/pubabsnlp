Impact of <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>ADRB1</i> polymorphisms on heart rate of post-PCI patients treated with metoprolol.
<b>Aim:</b> To explore the effect of <i>CYP2D6*10</i> (100C > T) and <i>ADRB1</i> 1165 G > C polymorphisms on heart rate of post-PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) patients treated with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 756 inpatients with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets were selected and the genotypes of <i>CYP2D6*10</i> and <i>ADRB1</i> 1165G > C were detected in 319 patients using gene chip detection. The target heart rate was defined as a resting heart rate < 70 beats/min. Clinical data were collected. <b>Results:</b> A total of 319 inpatients were enrolled in the study. The mutant allele frequencies of <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>ADRB1</i> were 57.21 and 69.44%, respectively. Whatever the dose of metoprolol, the heart rates were lower in patients with homozygous mutation of <i>CYP2D6</i> than those with heterozygous mutation and wild-type (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, this effect was not seen between different genotypes of <i>ADRB1</i>. Logistic regression analysis showed that the dose of metoprolol and the genotypes of <i>CYP2D6</i> were predictors of heart rate <70 beats/min in these patients. Further multivariate analysis indicated that patients with homozygous mutation had better control of heart rates compared with those with wild-type and heterozygous mutation of <i>CYP2D6*10</i> genotypes (all: p < 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b><i>CYP2D6*10</i> polymorphisms were associated with the heart rate of post-PCI patients treated with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets.
