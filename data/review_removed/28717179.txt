Genetic Polymorphisms and Platinum-based Chemotherapy Treatment Outcomes in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Genetic Epidemiology Study Based Meta-analysis.
Data regarding genetic polymorphisms and platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) treatment outcomes in patients with NSCLC are published at a growing pace, but the results are inconsistent. This meta-analysis integrated eligible candidate genes to better evaluate the pharmacogenetics of PBC in NSCLC patients. Relevant studies were retrieved from PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and WANFANG databases. A total of 111 articles comprising 18,196 subjects were included for this study. The associations of genetic polymorphisms with treatment outcomes of PBC including overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were determined by analyzing the relative risk (RR), hazard ration (HR), corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Eleven polymorphisms in 9 genes, including ERCC1 rs11615 (OS), rs3212986 (ORR), XPA rs1800975 (ORR), XPD rs1052555 (OS, PFS), rs13181 (OS, PFS), XPG rs2296147 (OS), XRCC1 rs1799782 (ORR), XRCC3 rs861539 (ORR), GSTP1 rs1695 (ORR), MTHFR rs1801133 (ORR) and MDR1 rs1045642 (ORR), were found significantly associated with PBC treatment outcomes. These variants were mainly involved in DNA repair (EXCC1, XPA, XPD, XPG, XRCC1 and XRCC3), drug influx and efflux (MDR1), metabolism and detoxification (GSTP1) and DNA synthesis (MTHFR), and might be considered as potential prognostic biomarkers for assessing objective response and progression risk in NSCLC patients receiving platinum-based regimens.
