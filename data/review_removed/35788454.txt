Identify Multiple Gene-Drug Common Modules via Constrained Graph Matching.
Identifying gene-drug interactions is vital to understanding biological mechanisms and achieving precise drug repurposing. High-throughput technologies produce a large amount of pharmacological and genomic data, providing an opportunity to explore the associations between oncogenic genes and therapeutic drugs. However, most studies only focus on "one-to-one" or "one-to-many" interactions, ignoring the multivariate patterns between genes and drugs. In this article, a high-order graph matching model with hypergraph constraints is proposed to discover the gene-drug common regulatory modules. Moreover, the prior knowledge is formulated into hypergraph constraints to reveal their multiple correspondences, penalizing the tensor matching process. The experimental results on the synthetic data demonstrate the proposed model is robust to noise contamination and outlier corruption, achieving a better performance than four state-of-the-art methods. We then evaluate the statistical power of our proposed method on the pharmacogenomics data. Our identified gene-drug common modules not only show significantly enriched pathways associated with cancer but also manifest the highly close gene-drug interactions.
