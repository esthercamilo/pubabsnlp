Characterization of Three CYP2C19 Gene Variants by MassARRAY and Point of Care Techniques: Experience from a Czech Centre.
Distribution of cytochrome P450 2C19 enzyme gene (CYP2C19) variants affecting metabolism of clopidogrel was determined in 526 Czech patients after percutaneous coronary intervention using MassARRAY genotyping and compared to distribution in other populations of European descent. Fifty-three (10%) patients underwent parallel determination of CYP2C19 genotypes from buccal swabs by a point of care technique with 100% concordance to the main genotyping platform. Observed CYP2C19 genotypes were related to clopidogrel metabolism phenotypes and discussed in population context. Hereby, presented methodologies provide accurate CYP2C19 genotyping results in a relatively short time of one up to 12Â h and may, therefore, find the relevant place in the field of genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy.
