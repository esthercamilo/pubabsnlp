Translation towards personalized medicine in Multiple Sclerosis.
In recent years the realization that the concept 'one drug fits all' - does not work, created the need to shift gears from 'treating the disease' to 'treating the patient', and implementation of 'Personalized Medicine' where treatment is tailored to the individual. In chronic and progressive diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the need for tailored therapeutics is especially imperative, as the consequences of an ineffective medication might be irreversible dysfunction. In recent years accumulating evidence indicates that MS is not a single disease and that patients with different disease subtypes respond differently to a medication. Environment and genetics are among the factors that determine disease subtype and activity, and the patient's response to medication. Additional factors include demographic characteristics such as gender and age, as well as chrono-biological indicators. During the last few years, advances and availability of new technologies have brought genome-wide gene expression profiling studies to many medical fields, including MS. Genomic technologies have also stimulated pharmacogenetics studies, that aim to identify genetic factors that affect response to treatment. However, pharmacogenetics information is still immature to allow its translation to clinical practice in MS. Notably, one of the major limitations in obtaining reproducible data across MS pharmacogenetics studies has been the lack of a consensus as to the appropriate method for determining clinical response. In light of the rapid advances in technology and progress in applying individualized treatment strategies in other diseases, 'Personalized Medicine' for MS seems feasible within the coming years.
