Integrating disease and drug-related phenotypes for improved identification of pharmacogenomic variants.
<b>Aim:</b> To improve the identification and interpretation of pharmacogenetic variants through the integration of disease and drug-related traits. <b>Materials & methods:</b> We hypothesized that integrating genome-wide disease and pharmacogenomic data may drive new insights into drug toxicity and response by identifying shared genetic architecture. Pleiotropic variants were identified using a methodological framework incorporating colocalization analysis. <b>Results:</b> Using genome-wide association studies summary statistics from the UK Biobank, European Bioinformatics Institute genome-wide association studies catalog and the Pharmacogenomics Research Network, we validated pleiotropy at the <i>ABCG2</i> locus between allopurinol response and gout and identified novel pleiotropy between antihypertensive-induced new-onset diabetes, Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel disease at the <i>IL18RAP/SLC9A4</i> locus. <b>Conclusion:</b> New mechanistic insights and genetic loci can be uncovered by identifying pleiotropy between disease and drug-related traits.
