CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 Genotypes and Metabolizer Status Distribution in a Bulgarian Psychiatric Cohort.
CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 are enzymes of essential significance for the pharmacokinetics of a multitude of commonly used antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiemetics, Î²-blockers, opioids, antiestrogen, antacids, etc. Polymorphisms in the respective genes are well established as resulting in functional differences, which in turn can impact safety and efficacy. Importantly, the prevalence of genetic <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i> variability differs drastically between populations. Drawing on the limited information concerning genotype frequencies in Bulgaria, we here analyzed 742 Bulgarian psychiatric patients predominantly diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety. Specifically, we analyzed frequencies of <i>CYPC19*2</i>, <i>*4</i> and <i>*17</i>, as well as of <i>CYP2D6*2</i>, <i>*3</i>, <i>*4</i>, <i>*5</i>, <i>*6</i>, <i>*10</i> and <i>*41</i>. In total, 571 out of 742 patients (77%) carried at least one variant which impacts metabolizer status. Overall, 48.6% of the studied individuals were classified as non-normal metabolizers of CYP2D6 with most exhibiting reduced function (38.2% intermediate metabolizers and 6.6% poor metabolizers). In contrast, for CYP2C19, the majority of non-normal metabolizers showed increased functionality (28.9% rapid and 5.5% ultrarapid metabolizers), while reduced activity metabolizer status accounted for 25.6% (23.8% intermediate and 1.8% poor metabolizers). These results provide an important resource to assess the genetically encoded functional variability of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 which may have significant implications for precision medicine in Bulgarian psychiatry practice.
