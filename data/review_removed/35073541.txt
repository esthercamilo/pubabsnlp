Influence of Clinically Significant Genes on Antiplatelet Effect of Clopidogrel and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome and Atrial Fibrillation.
The interindividual variability of the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel is determined by multiple clinical and genetic factors. A lot of genotype-oriented studies have concentrated on the impact of CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms on platelet aggregation in patients receiving clopidogrel. However, the influence of this polymorphism may be only 12-20%, so other genetic markers should also be investigated. The aim of this work was to study the impact of carriage of CES1, PON1, ABCG2, CYP4F2, CYP3A4, IGTB3, P2Y12, PEAR1, and B4GALT2 polymorphisms on antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel and clinical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and atrial fibrillation (AF).
