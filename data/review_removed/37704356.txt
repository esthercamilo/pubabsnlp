Current Practices in Pharmacogenomics.
Pharmacogenomics, where genomic information is used to tailor medication management, is a strategy to maximize drug efficacy and minimize toxicity. Although pediatric evidence is less robust than for adults, medications influenced by pharmacogenomics are prescribed to children and adolescents. Evidence-based guidelines and drug label annotations are available from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB). Some pediatric health care facilities use pharmacogenomics to provide dosing recommendations to pediatricians. Herein, we use a case-based approach to illustrate the use of pharmacogenomic data in pediatric clinical care and provide resources for finding and using pharmacogenomic guidelines.
