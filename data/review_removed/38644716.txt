Applications of L-Arginine in Pregnancy and Beyond: An Emerging Pharmacogenomic Approach.
L-arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that plays a critical role in various physiological processes, such as protein synthesis, wound healing, immune function, and cardiovascular regulation. The use of L-arginine in pregnancy has been an emerging topic in the field of pharmacogenomics. L-arginine, an amino acid, plays a crucial role in the production of nitric oxide, which is necessary for proper placental development and fetal growth. Studies have shown that L-arginine supplementation during pregnancy can have positive effects on fetal growth, maternal blood pressure, and the prevention of preeclampsia. This emerging pharmacogenomic approach involves using genetic information to personalize L-arginine dosages for pregnant women based on their specific genetic makeup. By doing so, it may be possible to optimize the benefits of L-arginine supplementation during pregnancy and improve pregnancy outcomes. This paper emphasizes the potential applications of L-arginine in pregnancy and the use of pharmacogenomic approaches to enhance its effectiveness. Nonetheless, the emerging pharmacogenomic approach to the application of L-arginine offers exciting prospects for the development of novel therapies for a wide range of diseases.
