The association between HLA-DQB1 polymorphism and antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury: a Case-Control Study.
Research on genetic factors associated with antitubercular drug-induced liver injuries (ATLI) has been reported. However, most of the research has focused on genetic polymorphisms of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, including NAT2, GST and CYP450. It is probable that the immune system also contributes to the onset of drug adverse effects. A few small studies have explored the possible association of HLA genes with drug-induced liver injuries (DILI), but more supportive evidence from larger studies or prospective cohort designs is needed. We aim to explore the possible association of HLA-DQB1 gene polymorphisms with ATLI in a case-control study.
