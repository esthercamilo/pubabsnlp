Genetic variation of the ABC transporter gene ABCC1 (Multidrug resistance protein 1-MRP1) in the Polish population.
Multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), encoded by the ABCC1 gene, is an ATP-binding cassette transporter mediating efflux of organic anions and xenobiotics; its overexpression leads to multidrug resistance. In this study, 30 exons (from 31 in total) of the ABCC1 gene as well as and their flanking intron sequences were screened for genetic variation, using the High Resolution Melting (HRM) method, for 190 healthy volunteers representing the Polish population. Polymorphism screening is an indispensable step in personalized patient therapy. An additional targeted SNP verification study for ten variants was performed to verify sensitivity of the scanning method.
