Translating pharmacogenomics discoveries into the clinic: an implementation framework.
The implementation of pharmacogenomics-guided care has the potential to improve clinical outcomes; however, the adoption of pharmacogenomics into clinical practice remains slow. This is partly due to the lack of a standardized framework for translating key findings into diagnostic tests. A recent study describes a comprehensive system developed by the Coriell Personalized Medicine Collaborative for facilitating the translation of genomic findings into clinical practice, and its application for seven commonly prescribed drugs.
