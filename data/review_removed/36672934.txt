Vitamin D Receptor Gene Polymorphisms Affect Osteoporosis-Related Traits and Response to Antiresorptive Therapy.
The present study analyzed the effect of vitamin D receptor (<i>VDR</i>) gene polymorphisms (ApaI, TaqI, BsmI, FokI, and Cdx2) on bone mineral density (BMD), biochemical parameters and bone turnover markers, fracture prevalence, and response to three types of antiresorptive therapy (estrogen-progesterone, raloxifene, and ibandronate) in 356 postmenopausal women from Slovakia. Association analysis revealed a significant effect of BsmI polymorphism on lumbar spine BMD, serum osteocalcin (OC), and Î²-CrossLaps levels. While ApaI and Cdx2 polymorphisms were associated with OC and alkaline phosphatase, TaqI polymorphism affected all turnover markers. ApaI, TaqI, and BsmI genotypes increased the risk of spinal, radial, or total fractures with odds ratios ranging from 2.03 to 3.17. Each of therapy types evaluated had a beneficial effect on all osteoporosis-related traits; however, the <i>VDR</i> gene affected only ibandronate and raloxifene treatment. ApaI/aa, TaqI/TT, and BsmI/bb genotypes showed a weaker or no response to ibandronate therapy in femoral and spinal BMD. The impact of aforementioned polymorphisms on turnover markers was also genotype dependent. On the contrary, only TaqI and BsmI polymorphisms influenced raloxifene therapy, even only in lumbar spine BMD. These results point to the potential of using the <i>VDR</i> gene in personalized pharmacotherapy of osteoporosis.
