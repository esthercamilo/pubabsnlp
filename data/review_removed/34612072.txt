SLCO1B3 polymorphisms and clinical outcomes in kidney transplant recipients receiving mycophenolate.
<b>Aim:</b> Determine the influence of <i>SLCO1B3</i> polymorphisms on outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. <b>Materials & methods:</b> We retrospectively evaluated 181 adult kidney transplant recipients receiving mycophenolate. Outcomes included treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR), <i>de novo</i> donor-specific antibody (dnDSA) formation, graft survival, patient survival and mycophenolate-related adverse effects among <i>SLCO1B3</i> genotypes. <b>Results:</b> The presence of <i>SLCO1B3</i> variants was not associated with increased risk of tBPAR (HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 0.76-2.74), dnDSA (HR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.16-1.36) or composite of tBPAR or dnDSA (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.64-2.03). Graft and patient survival were reduced among variant carriers; however, inconsistent findings with the primary analysis suggest these associations were not due to genotype. Adverse effects were similar between groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> Presence of <i>SLCO1B3</i> polymorphisms were not predictive of rejection or dnDSA in kidney transplant recipients.
