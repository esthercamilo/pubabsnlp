Pharmacogenomics, lipid disorders, and treatment options.
Statins form the backbone of lipid-lowering therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Numerous studies have evaluated the effect of genomics on the clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. Several gene variants that can be linked to either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of statins have been identified as potentially important, although there are some discrepant findings among studies. Effect sizes are modest for lipid-lowering efficacy and perhaps somewhat larger for risk of myopathy, although results are inconsistent. Pharmacogenomics of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents have not been evaluated to the same extent, given their relatively limited use, although there are some promising candidate genes for further study. Finally, with several new classes of lipid-lowering therapies soon becoming available, there may be a potential application for pharmacogenomics to identify patients ideally suited to receive-or those who should avoid-specific medications.
