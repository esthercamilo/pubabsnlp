[Approach to find new therapies for MS from clinical view].
Immunomodulatory drugs such as interferon beta (IFN-beta) have modestly effective in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). However, all current therapies are partially effective. The cause of MS and the determinants of heterogeneity in the clinical phenotype of MS remain largely unknown and new therapeutic approaches in MS are emerging. Even now, "bench to bed" is the only approach to find new therapies. However, we need to take part in exploring new therapies with the approach of "bench to bed and back". In the near future, studies on susceptibility genes and pharmacogenetics will provide invaluable information concerning new drugs for the treatment of MS and better therapeutic regimens for MS patients.
