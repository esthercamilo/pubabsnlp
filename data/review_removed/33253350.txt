Drug response in association with pharmacogenomics and pharmacomicrobiomics: towards a better personalized medicine.
Researchers have long been presented with the challenge imposed by the role of genetic heterogeneity in drug response. For many years, Pharmacogenomics and pharmacomicrobiomics has been investigating the influence of an individual's genetic background to drug response and disposition. More recently, the human gut microbiome has proven to play a crucial role in the way patients respond to different therapeutic drugs and it has been shown that by understanding the composition of the human microbiome, we can improve the drug efficacy and effectively identify drug targets. However, our knowledge on the effect of host genetics on specific gut microbes related to variation in drug metabolizing enzymes, the drug remains limited and therefore limits the application of joint host-microbiome genome-wide association studies. In this paper, we provide a historical overview of the complex interactions between the host, human microbiome and drugs. While discussing applications, challenges and opportunities of these studies, we draw attention to the critical need for inclusion of diverse populations and the development of an innovative and combined pharmacogenomics and pharmacomicrobiomics approach, that may provide an important basis in personalized medicine.
