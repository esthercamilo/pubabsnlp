The effect of ABCA1 gene DNA methylation on blood pressure levels in a Chinese hyperlipidemic population.
Hypertension is an important public health challenge worldwide. Epigenetic studies are providing novel insight into the underlying mechanisms of hypertension. We investigated the effect of DNA methylation in ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) gene on blood pressure levels in a Chinese hyperlipidemic population. We randomly selected 211 individuals with hyperlipidemia who had not received any lipid-lowering treatment at baseline from our previous statin pharmacogenetics study (n = 734). DNA methylation loci at the ABCA1 gene were measured by MethylTarget, a next generation bisulfite sequencing-based multiple targeted cytosine-guanine dinucleotide methylation analysis method. Mean DNA methylation level was used in statistical analysis. In all subjects, higher mean ABCA1_B methylation was positively associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) (β = 8.27, P = 0.008; β = 8.78, P = 0.005) and explained 2.7% and 5.8% of SBP variation before and after adjustment for lipids, respectively. We further divided all patients into three groups based on the tertile of body mass index (BMI) distribution. In the middle tertile of BMI, there was a significantly positive relationship between mean ABCA1_A methylation and SBP (β = 0.89, P = 0.003) and DBP (β = 0.32, P = 0.030). Mean ABCA1_A methylation explained 11.0% of SBP variation and 5.3% of DBP variation, respectively. Furthermore, mean ABCA1_A methylation (β = 0.79; P = 0.007) together with age and gender explained up to 24.1% of SBP variation. Our study provides new evidence that the ABCA1 DNA methylation profile is associated with blood pressure levels, which highlights that DNA methylation might be a significant molecular mechanism involved in the pathophysiological process of hypertension.
