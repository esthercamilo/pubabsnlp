Genetic Biomarkers of Sorafenib Response in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
The identification of biomarkers for predicting inter-individual sorafenib response variability could allow hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient stratification. SNPs in angiogenesis- and drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)-related genes were evaluated to identify new potential predictive biomarkers of sorafenib response in HCC patients. Five known SNPs in angiogenesis-related genes, including <i>VEGF-A</i>, <i>VEGF-C</i>, <i>HIF-1a</i>, <i>ANGPT2</i>, and <i>NOS3</i>, were investigated in 34 HCC patients (9 sorafenib responders and 25 non-responders). A subgroup of 23 patients was genotyped for SNPs in ADME genes. A machine learning classifier method was used to discover classification rules for our dataset. We found that only the <i>VEGF-A</i> (rs2010963) C allele and CC genotype were significantly associated with sorafenib response. ADME-related gene analysis identified 10 polymorphic variants in <i>ADH1A</i> (rs6811453), <i>ADH6</i> (rs10008281), <i>SULT1A2/CCDC101</i> (rs11401), <i>CYP26A1</i> (rs7905939), <i>DPYD</i> (rs2297595 and rs1801265), <i>FMO2</i> (rs2020863), and <i>SLC22A14</i> (rs149738, rs171248, and rs183574) significantly associated with sorafenib response. We have identified a genetic signature of predictive response that could permit non-responder/responder patient stratification. Angiogenesis- and ADME-related genes correlation was confirmed by cumulative genetic risk score and network and pathway enrichment analysis. Our findings provide a proof of concept that needs further validation in follow-up studies for HCC patient stratification for sorafenib prescription.
