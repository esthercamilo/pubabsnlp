Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of stable warfarin dose in patients of African ancestry.
Warfarin dose requirements are highly variable due to clinical and genetic factors. While genetic variants influencing warfarin dose have been identified in European and East Asian populations, more work is needed to identify African-specific genetic variants to help optimize warfarin dosing. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in four African cohorts from Uganda, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, totalling 989 warfarin-treated participants who reached stable dose and had international normalized ratios within therapeutic ranges. We also included two African American cohorts recruited by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (n=316) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (n=199). Following the GWAS, we performed standard error-weighted meta-analyses and then conducted stepwise conditional analyses to account for known loci (the CYP2C cluster SNP rs12777823 and CYP2C9 in chromosome 10; VKORC1 in chromosome 16). The genome-wide significance threshold was set at P<5×10-8. The meta-analysis, comprising 1,504 participants identified 242 significant SNPs across three genomic loci, with 99.6% of these located within known loci on chromosomes 10 (top SNP: rs58800757, P=4.27×10-13) and 16 (top SNP: rs9925964, P=9.97×10-16). Adjustment for the VKORC1 SNP -1639G>A revealed an additional locus on chromosome 2 (top SNPs rs116057875/rs115254730/rs115240773, P=3.64×10-8), implicating the MALL gene, that could indirectly influence warfarin response through interactions with caveolin-1. In conclusion, our meta-analysis of six cohorts of warfarin-treated patients of African ancestry reaffirmed the importance of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 in influencing warfarin dose requirements. We also identified a new locus (MALL), that still requires direct evidence of biological plausibility.
