<i>NUDT15</i> and <i>TPMT</i> polymorphisms in three distinct native populations of the Brazilian Amazon.
This is the first report of the distribution of <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i> single nucleotide polymorphisms and metabolic phenotypes associated with cytotoxicity of thiopurine drugs, in indigenous groups of Brazilian Amazon: Munduruku, Paiter-Suruí and Yanomami. The minor allele frequency (MAF) of <i>NUDT15</i> rs116855232 did not differ significantly across the groups; <i>TPMT</i> rs1800462 was absent, while rs1800460 and rs1142345 were in strong linkage disequilibrium, and 10- and 30-fold more common in Paiter-Suruí. Indeed, the MAFs in Paiter-Surui (0.193 and 0.188) are the largest report globally. The distribution of combined NUDT15/TPMT metabolic phenotypes differed significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.0001) and largely (Cramér´s V = 0.37) across cohorts. This has important pharmacogenetic implications: the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommendations to reduce or consider reduction of thiopurine dose applies to 4.4% Yanomami, 5.6% Munduruku, <i>versus</i> 41% Paiter-Suruí. The proportion of Paiter-Suruí at risk of thiopurine intolerance is 3- to 4-fold higher than any other population worldwide.
