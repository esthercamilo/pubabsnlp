CYP2C19 slow metabolizer phenotype is associated with lower antidepressant efficacy and tolerability.
The inter-individual variability in CYP2C19-mediated metabolism may affect the antidepressant treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate differences in antidepressant efficacy and tolerability between different CYP2C19 metabolizer categories in inpatients suffering from major depressive disorder. The cohort was divided into experimental groups based on CYP2C19 genotype and it contained 24 slow (SMs), 41 normal (NMs), and 37 fast metabolizers (FMs). Efficacy and tolerability were assessed at baseline, and after two and four weeks as a follow-up. The primary efficacy measurement was the change from baseline in Hamilton's Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), while the primary tolerability measurement was the Toronto Side-Effects Scale (TSES) intensity scores at the last visit. The reduction in HAMD score was 36% less pronounced and response rate was exceedingly less prevalent (75% lower) in SMs, compared with NMs. The TSES intensity score was increased in SMs, compared with NMs, by 43% for central nervous system and by 22% for gastrointestinal adverse drug reactions. No significant differences in measured parameters were observed between NMs and FMs. Compared with NM and RM, lower antidepressant efficacy and tolerability was observed in SMs; this association is likely connected with the lower SM capacity to metabolize antidepressant drugs.
