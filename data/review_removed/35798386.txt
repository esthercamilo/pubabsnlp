<b><i>Influence of CYP2B6 Pharmacogenetics on Stereoselective Inhibition and Induction of Bupropion Metabolism by Efavirenz in Healthy Volunteers</i></b>.
We investigated the acute and chronic effects of efavirenz, a widely used antiretroviral drug, and <i>CYP2B6</i> genotypes on the disposition of racemic and stereoisomers of bupropion (BUP) and its active metabolites, 4-hydroxyBUP, threohydroBUP and erythrohydroBUP. The primary objective of this study was to test how multiple processes unique to the efavirenz-<i>CYP2B6</i> genotype interaction influence the extent of efavirenz-mediated drug-drug interaction (DDI) with the CYP2B6 probe substrate BUP. In a three-phase, sequential, open-label study, healthy volunteers (N=53) were administered a single 100 mg oral dose of BUP alone (control phase), with a single 600 mg oral efavirenz dose (inhibition phase), and after 17-days pretreatment with efavirenz (600 mg/day) (induction phase). Compared to the control phase, we show for the first time that efavirenz significantly decreases and chronically increases the exposure of hydroxyBUP and its diastereomers, respectively, and these interactions were <i>CYP2B6</i> genotype dependent. Chronic efavirenz enhances the elimination of racemic BUP and its enantiomers as well as of threo- and erythro-hydroBUP and their diastereomers, suggesting additional novel mechanisms underlying efavirenz interaction with BUP. The effects of efavirenz and genotypes were nonstereospecific. In conclusion, acute and chronic administration of efavirenz inhibits and induces CYP2B6 activity. Efavirenz-BUP interaction is complex involving time- and <i>CYP2B6</i> genotype-dependent inhibition and induction of primary and secondary metabolic pathways. Our findings highlight important implications to the safety and efficacy of BUP, study design considerations for future efavirenz interactions, and individualized drug therapy based on <i>CYP2B6</i> genotypes. <b>Significance Statement</b> The effects of acute and chronic doses of efavirenz on the disposition of racemic and stereoisomers of BUP and its active metabolites were investigated in healthy volunteers. Efavirenz causes an acute inhibition, but chronic induction of CYP2B6 in a genotype dependent manner. Chronic efavirenz induces BUP reduction and the elimination of BUP active metabolites. Efavirenz's effects were non-stereospecific. These data reveal novel mechanisms underlying efavirenz DDI with BUP and provide important insights into time- and <i>CYP2B6</i> genotype dependent DDIs.
