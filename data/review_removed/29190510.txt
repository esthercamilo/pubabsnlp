Predicted activity of UGT2B7, ABCB1, OPRM1, and COMT using full-gene haplotypes and their association with the CYP2D6-inferred metabolizer phenotype.
The pharmacogene, CYP2D6, is commonly used to infer metabolizer phenotype of many marketed drugs and endogenous toxins in ante- and post-mortem patients but only represents the efficiency of phase 1 metabolism. Downstream metabolic enzymes encoded by UGT2B7, ABCB1, OPRM1, and COMT also have been implicated in variable individual response to drugs due to their activity at different stages of the tramadol ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) process. While commonly studied as single genes using targeted genotyping approaches, a more comprehensive tramadol metabolism profile has not been evaluated. 1000 Genomes Project data for UGT2B7, ABCB1, OPRM1, and COMT were used to characterize full-gene haplotypes and their effect on protein function using in-house excel-based workbooks, PopART, and TreeView. Population genetic summary statistics and intergenic analyses associated these haplotypes with full-gene CYP2D6-inferred metabolizer phenotype. The findings suggest that UGT2B7, ABCB1, OPRM1, and COMT may contribute to predicted metabolizer phenotype as opposed to relying solely on CYP2D6.
