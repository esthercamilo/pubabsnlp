CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes in Puerto Ricans: A case for admixture-matching in clinical pharmacogenetic studies.
Admixture is of great relevance to the clinical application of pharmacogenetics and personalized medicine, but unfortunately these studies have been scarce in Puerto Ricans. Besides, allele frequencies for clinically relevant genetic markers in warfarin response (i.e., CYP2C9 and VKORC1) have not yet been fully characterized in this population. Accordingly, this study is aimed at investigating whether a correlation between overall genetic similarity and CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotypes could be established.
