The impact of <i>ABCB1</i> (rs1045642 and rs4148738) and <i>CES1</i> (rs2244613) gene polymorphisms on dabigatran equilibrium peak concentration in patients after total knee arthroplasty.
Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are commonly used for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in orthopedic patients. Despite known safety and high potency of NOACs, potential interactions of NOACs with genetic polymorphisms are poorly understood. Dabigatran etexilate is one of the most commonly prescribed direct thrombin inhibitors for the prevention of VTE. The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of <i>ABCB1</i> (rs1045642 and rs4148738) and <i>CES1</i> (rs2244613) polymorphisms on dabigatran pharmacokinetics in patients after total knee arthroplasty.
