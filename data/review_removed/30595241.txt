Value of VKORC1 (-1639G>A) rs9923231 genotyping in predicting warfarin dose: A replication study in South Indian population.
Warfarin is the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant, although having a narrow therapeutic index and wide interindividual variability. The aim of this study was to replicate the utility of VKORC1 (-1639G>A) rs9923231 genotyping in predicting the mean daily doseÂ and to evaluate its ability to categorize warfarin-treated patients to high-, intermediate-, or low-dose categories in the South Indian population.
