Alpha Adducin (ADD1) Gene Polymorphism and New Onset of Diabetes Under the Influence of Selective Antihypertensive Therapy in Essential Hypertension.
Different antihypertensive therapies (especially diuretics) are reported to induce the new onset of diabetes in some hypertensive patients. Î±-adducin-1 (ADD1) gene is salt sensitive gene which has its role in etiology of hypertension via salt sensitivity. Therefore, the G460T polymorphism of ADD1 gene may be associated with new onset of diabetes under the influence of diuretic and other antihypertensive therapies.
