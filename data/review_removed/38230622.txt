Antiplatelet therapy guided by <i>CYP2C19</i> point-of-care pharmacogenetics plus multidimensional treatment decisions.
<b>Aim:</b> Implementation of <i>CYP2C19</i> point-of-care (POC) pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing with personalized treatment recommendations. <b>Methods:</b> POC <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping plus expert evaluation of risk factors for ischemic and bleeding events. <b>Results:</b> 167 patients underwent PGx testing, 54 (32.3%) were <i>CYP2C19</i> loss of function carriers, and POC versus standard PGx analysis results for <i>*2</i> and <i>*3</i> variants matched in 100%. Antiplatelet therapy was adjusted in 44 patients (26.3%), but always required consideration of patient-specific factors. <b>Conclusion:</b> <i>CYP2C19</i> POC-PGx is reliable and offers clinically relevant advantages for immediate evidence-based adaptations of antiplatelet therapy, whereas in less acute cases conventional PGx testing can also have advantages. Antiplatelet therapy has become more complex, and implementation of PGx-based personalized antiplatelet therapy requires complementary expert knowledge.
