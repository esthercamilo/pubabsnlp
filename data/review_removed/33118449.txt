Evaluating the current level of pharmacists' pharmacogenomics knowledge and its impact on pharmacogenomics implementation.
The pharmacists' role is potentially vital in the growing field of personalized medicine, and well-defined guidelines and knowledge that support this role need to be established. To address the knowledge gap, over the past two decades, pharmacy schools have started providing pharmacogenomics-related courses, a field that overlaps with pharmacy and personalized medicine. Given the fact that pharmacists lead 50% of the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium implementers' sites, their role can be particularly crucial to move forward the integration of precision medicine in clinical practice. Herein, we aim to identify the educational challenges for pharmacogenomics integration into clinical practice and their impact on pharmacists' knowledge and confidence, in addition to underscoring pharmacists' role in pharmacogenomics as a whole.
