Effects of pharmacogenetics on pharmacokinetics and toxicity of doxorubicin in Egyptian breast cancer patients.
This study investigates the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes (SLC22A16 and CBR1) involved in the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of doxorubicin (DOX) in Egyptian female patients with breast cancer.Patients administered DOX (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for 4 cycles every 3 weeks. The peak DOX plasma concentration was measured using a validated chromatographic method. The genotyping for the selected SNPs, SLC22A16 T > C (rs714368), and CBR1 C > T (rs20572), was performed by RT-PCR. Patients were monitored for hematological and cardiac toxicities.The variant carriers of CBR1 C > T (rs20572) exhibited significantly higher DOX concentration, but no significant association to DOX-induced hematological toxicity. On the other hand, SLC22A16 T > C (rs714368) had no significant influence on DOX plasma concentration, but was significantly correlated with lower risk of neutropenia (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12-0.75, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and leukopoenia (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.5, <i>p</i> = 0.001). DOX-related cardiotoxicity was correlated with the cumulative dose of DOX (<i>R</i> = 0.238, <i>p</i> = 0.017), but not with any of the two examined SNPs.Genetic polymorphisms in SLC22A16 and CBR1 may explain the inter-individual variations in DOX pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Using pharmacogenetic testing is important to customise drug therapy for cancer patients treated with anthracyclines.
