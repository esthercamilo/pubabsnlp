First Case of Foot Drop Associated with Capecitabine in a Patient with Thymidylate Synthase Polymorphism.
Capecitabine, an oral prodrug of 5-FU, has been approved by the FDA for use in patients with breast and colon cancers. In addition, capecitabine is commonly used in patients with other malignancies such as pancreatic, gastroesophageal, and hepatobiliary tract cancers. Though cerebellar toxicity is a rare but well-known side effect of intravenous 5-FU therapy, peripheral neuropathy with capecitabine has only been described in rare cases. In this case report, we describe a 79-year-old patient with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas undergoing chemoradiation therapy with capecitabine who developed peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first patient in the literature who was found to have two mutations (2R) of a 28 base-pair tandem repeat in the 5' promoter enhancer region (5'-TSER) on both alleles (2R/2R) of thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) gene, possibly responsible for the neurotoxicity.
