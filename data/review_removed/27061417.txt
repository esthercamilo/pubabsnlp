Pharmacokinetic variations in cancer patients with liver dysfunction: applications and challenges of pharmacometabolomics.
In cancer patients, pharmacokinetic variations between individuals and within individuals due to impairments in organs' function and other reasons such as genetic polymorphisms represent a major problem in disease management, which can result in unpredictable toxicity and variable antineoplastic effects. Addressing pharmacokinetic variations in cancer patients with liver dysfunction and their implications on anticancer and analgesic drugs, in addition to the use of advanced analytical techniques such as metabolomics and pharmacometabolomics, to monitor altered kinetic and discover metabolic biomarkers during therapeutic intervention will help in understanding and reducing pharmacokinetic variations of drugs in cancer patients as a step forward towards personalised medicine.
