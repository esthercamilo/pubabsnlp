Frequencies of Functional Polymorphisms in Three Pharmacokinetic Genes of Clinical Interest within the Admixed Puerto Rican Population.
This cross-sectional study was aimed at determining the allele frequencies for the <i>CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, CYP2D6*10</i> and <i>PON1</i> (rs662) polymorphisms in the Puerto Rican population. The <i>CYP2C19, CYP2D6</i> and <i>PON1</i> genes are known to be associated with functional changes in drug metabolism and activation. Individuals carrying the aforementioned polymorphisms are at a higher risk of suffering from drug-induced adverse events and/ or unresponsiveness from a variety of drugs that includes antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics and antiplatelet compounds. Information on the frequency of these polymorphisms is more commonly found on homogeneous populations, but is scarce in highly heterogeneous populations like Hispanics, as in the case of Puerto Ricans.
