Sources of Interindividual Variability.
The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of drugs are dependent on numerous factors that influence their disposition. A dose that is efficacious and safe for one individual may result in sub-therapeutic or toxic blood concentrations in others. A significant source of this variability in drug response is drug metabolism, where differences in presystemic and systemic biotransformation efficiency result in variable degrees of systemic exposure (e.g., AUC, C<sub>max</sub>, and/or C<sub>min</sub>) following administration of a fixed dose.Interindividual differences in drug biotransformation have been studied extensively. It is recognized that both intrinsic factors (e.g., genetics, age, sex, and disease states) and extrinsic factors (e.g., diet , chemical exposures from the environment, and the microbiome) play a significant role. For drug-metabolizing enzymes, genetic variation can result in the complete absence or enhanced expression of a functional enzyme. In addition, upregulation and downregulation of gene expression, in response to an altered cellular environment, can achieve the same range of metabolic function (phenotype), but often in a less predictable and time-dependent manner. Understanding the mechanistic basis for variability in drug disposition and response is essential if we are to move beyond the era of empirical, trial-and-error dose selection and into an age of personalized medicine that will improve outcomes in maintaining health and treating disease.
