Pharmacogenetics of aspirin-intolerant asthma.
Leukotriene overproduction is the major characteristic of aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA). Most studies examining the molecular genetic mechanisms of AIA have focused on leukotriene-related genes, including ALOX5, LTC4S, TXA2R and prostanoid-receptor genes. One study suggested that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele DPB1*0301 may be a genetic marker for the AIA phenotype in European and Asian populations, and HLA-DPB1*0301 has been suggested as a useful genetic marker for predicting more favorable responders to leukotriene-receptor antagonists for long-term management of AIA. Although several reports have indicated possible associations between genetic polymorphisms and variable responses to leukotriene modifiers in nonaspirin sensitive asthmatic patients, few have suggested relationships between such genetic polymorphisms and variable responses to asthma drugs in AIA patients.
