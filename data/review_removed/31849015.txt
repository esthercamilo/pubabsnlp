Sparse Partial Least Squares Methods for Joint Modular Pattern Discovery.
The underlying relationship between genomic factors and the response of diverse cancer drugs still remains unclear. A number of studies showed that the heterogeneous responses to anticancer treatments of patients were partly associated with their specific changes in gene expression and somatic alterations. However, how to identify the multiple-to-multiple relationships between genomic factors and drug response among pharmacogenomics data is still a challenging issue. Here, we introduce a sparse partial least squares (SPLS) framework with or without the network-regularized penalty to identify joint modular patterns demonstrated with a large-scale pairwise gene-expression and drug-response data. The identified modular patterns reveal some coordinated gene-drug associations. SPLS methods could be applied to many biological problems such as the eQTL analysis, which is designed to discover genetic variants that influence downstream gene expression level. In summary, SPLS-based methods are a set of powerful tools to uncover the associations between different types of features.
