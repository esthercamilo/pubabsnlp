Evaluation of the relationship between polymorphisms in CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 and the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib.
Celecoxib is metabolized by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) superfamily, mainly CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 gene have been associated with decreased enzyme activity and alteration of celecoxib pharmacokinetic parameters. However, literature reports are limited, and some results are contradictory. We enrolled 24 healthy volunteers in a single-dose replicated crossover trial with celecoxib 200â€‰mg. We evaluated the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 genes (CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3, CYP2C8*4, CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3) of these individuals and the pharmacokinetic parameters of celecoxib. Subjects carrying CYP2C9*1/*3 and CYP2C9*3/*3 had a higher AUC (2- and 7.7-fold, respectively) and Cmax (1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively) and lower clearance (2.3- and 10-fold, respectively) than those carrying CYP2C9*1/*1. Half-life was 2.7-fold higher in subjects with CYP2C9*3/*3 than in those with the wild type but not in those with CYP2C9*1/*3. We did not find any significant effect of gender or CYP2C8 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib. In conclusion, the recommended dose of celecoxib should be decreased in CYP2C9*3 carriers, especially in homozygous subjects.
