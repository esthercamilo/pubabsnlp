Impact of Genetic Polymorphisms and Biomarkers on the Effectiveness and Toxicity of Treatment of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
Most malignant hematological diseases are generally a consequence of acquired mutations or rearrangements in cell replication processes. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease that results from acquired genetic and epigenetic alterations in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Despite the advances made in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease, the overall survival of patients remains very low due to the high relapse rate. Pharmacogenetics and massive sequencing studies have allowed the identification of new recurrent mutations with significant prognostic impact in AML; furthermore, it seems likely that whole genome sequencing will soon become a standard diagnostic test, which will allow the molecular diagnosis of patients. Therefore, it is necessary to develop molecular targets that open new therapeutic perspectives and allow individualized treatment of patients with this aggressive disease. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the first neoplastic disease for which a characteristic genetic alteration was described. It has, by definition, a genetic marker, the BCR::ABL1 rearrangement, as a consequence of the t9;22(q34;q11) translocation. Its study is essential for the diagnosis of this entity and also for monitoring the response to treatment. Drugs known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the BCR::ABL1 protein (oral targeted therapy) are the conventional treatment of CML, representing a change of paradigm in the management of oncohematological patients.
