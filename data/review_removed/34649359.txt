Association between migraine prevalence, treatment with proton-pump inhibitors and CYP2C19 phenotypes in UK Biobank.
Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used to suppress gastric acid secretion in several gastrointestinal conditions. While these drugs are generally well tolerated, their long-term use may be associated with different adverse effects, including migraine. We analyzed the association between treatment with PPIs (omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole) and migraine prevalence in the UK Biobank cohort through a cross-sectional analysis (using baseline data for 468,280 participants, 16,390 of whom had migraine) and a longitudinal analysis (including 145,007 participants with no migraine at baseline, of whom 3786 had probable migraine without aura [MWOA] and 9981 probable migraine with aura [MWA] or both MWOA and MWA at an average follow-up time of 10.06 years). We also evaluated the modulating role of the metabolizer phenotype of CYP2C19, the major enzyme involved in PPI clearance. Treatment with PPIs was associated with higher migraine prevalence at baseline (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25, p < 0.0001). CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer phenotype was associated with lower prevalence of migraine exclusively in participants treated with PPIs (OR = 0.89, p = 0.029). In addition, treatment with PPIs was associated with higher incidence of both probable MWOA (OR = 1.24, p = 0.002) and MWA (OR = 1.43, p < 0.0001) at follow-up. Treatment with PPIs and CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status were associated with higher incidence of probable chronic migraine exclusively in men. Our results suggest a significant association between treatment with PPIs and migraine in this large population-based cohort and support a potential relevant role of gender and CYP2C19 phenotype.
