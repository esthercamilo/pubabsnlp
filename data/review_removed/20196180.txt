An improved in silico selection of phenotype affecting polymorphisms in SLC6A4, HTR1A and HTR2A genes.
Among the experimentally assessed DNA variations in serotonin related genes, some influence physiological expression of personality and mental disorders, others alter the responses to pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatments. Because of the huge number of polymorphisms lying in genes and of the great length of time necessary to perform association studies, a selection of the variations being studied is a necessary and crucial step.
