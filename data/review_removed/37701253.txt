Elevations in Norclobazam Concentrations and Altered Mental Status in CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizer Phenotype: A Case Report.
Clobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine frequently used as an adjunctive agent for refractory seizures and status epilepticus. Clobazam undergoes metabolism to an active metabolite norclobazam which is subsequently hydroxylated by CYP2C19, a cytochrome with several pharmacogenetic variants. Patients with poor metabolizer phenotypes may have elevated norclobazam levels and subsequent adverse effects. We present a case of an Asian American male receiving clobazam at a standard therapeutic dose for seizure disorder who became comatose secondary to significantly elevated norclobazam concentrations. Genetic testing revealed the patient was a poor CYP2C19 metabolizer, accounting for the impaired clearance. Clinicians should be aware of the patient populations at risk for these genetic polymorphisms and adjust initial doses based on package labeling or consider therapeutic drug monitoring to avoid adverse effects.
