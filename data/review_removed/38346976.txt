Haplotype phasing of CYP2D6: an allelic ratio method using Agena MassARRAY data.
Pharmacogenomics aims to use the genetic information of an individual to personalize drug prescribing. There is evidence that pharmacogenomic testing before prescription may prevent adverse drug reactions, increase efficacy, and reduce cost of treatment. CYP2D6 is a key pharmacogene of relevance to multiple therapeutic areas. Indeed, there are prescribing guidelines available for medications based on CYP2D6 enzyme activity as deduced from CYP2D6 genetic data. The Agena MassARRAY system is a cost-effective method of detecting genetic variation that has been clinically applied to other genes. However, its clinical application to CYP2D6 has to date been limited by weaknesses such as the inability to determine which haplotype was present in more than one copy for individuals with more than two copies of the CYP2D6 gene. We report application of a new protocol for CYP2D6 haplotype phasing of data generated from the Agena MassARRAY system. For samples with more than two copies of the CYP2D6 gene for which the prior consensus data specified which one was present in more than one copy, our protocol was able to conduct CYP2D6 haplotype phasing resulting in 100% concordance with the prior data. In addition, for three reference samples known to have more than two copies of CYP2D6 but for which the exact number of CYP2D6 genes was unknown, our protocol was able to resolve the number for two out of the three of these, and estimate the likely number for the third. Finally, we demonstrate that our method is applicable to CYP2D6 hybrid tandem configurations.
