Association between <i>ABCB1</i> rs2235048 Polymorphism and THC Pharmacokinetics and Subjective Effects following Smoked Cannabis in Young Adults.
Genetic influences on acute responses to psychoactive drugs may contribute to individual variability in addiction risk. <i>ABCB1</i> is a human gene that encodes P-glycoprotein, an ATP-dependent efflux pump that may influence the pharmacokinetics of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. Using data from 48 young adults (aged 19-25 years) reporting 1-4 days of cannabis use per week who completed a placebo-controlled human laboratory experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the rs2235048 polymorphism of <i>ABCB1</i> would influence acute responses to smoked cannabis. C-allele carriers reported on average greater frequency of weekly cannabis use compared to the TT genotype carriers (TC/CC mean ± SEM = 2.74 ± 0.14, TT = 1.85 ± 0.24, <i>p</i> = 0.004). After smoking a single cannabis cigarette to their desired high, C-allele carriers had higher area-under-the-curve (AUC) of both THC metabolites (11-OH-THC TC/CC = 7.18 ± 9.64, TT = 3.28 ± 3.40, <i>p</i> = 0.05; THC-COOH TC/CC = 95.21 ± 116.12, TT = 45.92 ± 42.38, <i>p</i> = 0.043), and these results were impact by self-reported ethnicity. There were no significant differences in self-reported subjective drug effects except for a greater AUC of visual analogue scale rating of drug liking (TC/CC = 35,398.33 ± 37,233.72, TT = 15,895.56 ± 13,200.68, <i>p</i> = 0.017). Our preliminary findings suggest that further work in a larger sample should investigate whether human <i>ABCB1</i> influences cannabis-related phenotypes and plays a role in the risk of developing a cannabis use disorder.
