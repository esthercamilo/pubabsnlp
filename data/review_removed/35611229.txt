A Pilot Study for Return of Individual Pharmacogenomic Results to Population-Based Cohort Study Participants.
Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing results provide valuable information on drug selection and appropriate dosing, maximization of efficacy, and minimization of adverse effects. Although the number of large-scale, next-generation-sequencing-based PGx studies has recently increased, little is known about the risks and benefits of returning PGx results to ostensibly healthy individuals in research settings.
