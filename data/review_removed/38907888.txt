Allele Frequency Net Database.
The allele frequency net database (AFND, http://www.allelefrequencies.net ) is an online web-based repository that contains information on the frequencies of immune-related genes and their corresponding alleles in worldwide human populations. At present, the website contains data from 1784 population samples in more than 14 million individuals from 129 countries on the frequency of genes from different polymorphic regions including data for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system. In addition, over the last four years, AFND has also incorporated genotype raw data from 85,000 individuals comprising 215 population samples from 39 countries. Moreover, more population data sets containing next generation sequencing data spanning >3 million individuals have been added. This resource has been widely used in a variety of contexts such as histocompatibility, immunology, epidemiology, pharmacogenetics, epitope prediction algorithms for population coverage in vaccine development, population genetics, among many others. In this chapter, we present an update of the most used searching mechanisms as described in a previous volume and some of the latest developments included in AFND.
