The SLCO1B1 c.521T>C polymorphism is associated with dose decrease or switching during statin therapy in the Rotterdam Study.
The SLCO1B1 c.521T>C polymorphism is associated with statin plasma levels and simvastatin-induced adverse drug reactions. We studied whether the c.521T>C polymorphism is associated with dose decreases or switches to other cholesterol-lowering drugs during simvastatin and atorvastatin therapy, because these events are indicators of adverse drug reactions.
