Analysis of Research Publications on Pharmacogenomics of Sulphonylurea - A Scientometric Study.
This study analysed pharmacogenomics studies on sulfonylurea research publications using the Pubmed and Scopus databases. In the end, 65 publications from the years 2015 to 2021 were noticed. The objective of this study was to analyse these studies using scientometric tools, such as frequency counts, percentages, relative growth rates, doubling times, and collectively. A maximum of 19 (29.23%) research publications were contributed during the 2020 research period. The relative growth rate tends to decrease from 2015 to 2020 and the doubling time tends to increase and decrease after 2020. Up to 2 (3.08%) research publications were contributed by Ewan R. Pearson and Chen each. The top authors have an average degree of collaboration of 0.90 and 41 (63.83%) of their research publications are articles. The United States is the major contributor with 19 (29.23%) pharmacogenomics research publications on sulfonylureas. Although the United States is the most prolific country in sulfonylurea pharmacogenomics research, there are few Indian institutions that are not listed among the most prolific institutions.
