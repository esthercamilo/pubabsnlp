A hub for bench-to-bedside pharmacogenomic-based research.
In 2003 Duke University (Durham, NC, USA) launched the Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy (IGSP) as an interdisciplinary network of centers comprised of scientists, engineers and physicians, as well as experts in law, business, economics public policy and ethics. Within this environment, the IGSP and its Center for Genomic Medicine form the hub for pharmacogenomic research discovery initiatives through collaborations with other scientific and clinical units at the Duke University Medical Center. The Center for Genomic Medicine specifically focuses on developing strategies for translating and implementing pharmacogenomic discoveries into the clinical arena; therefore, by harnessing the resources of the IGSP as well as other complementary centers on campus, Duke University is poised to accelerate the development of novel pharmacgenomic paradigms for the prevention and treatment of disease. These new treatment paradigms can, potentially, ensure that the right dose of the right drug is prescribed to the right individual - an often stated goal of personalized medicine and pharmacogenomics.
