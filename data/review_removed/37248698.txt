Pharmacogenetics of 6-mercaptopurine in a black Zimbabwean cohort treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.
<b>Background:</b> 6-mercaptopurine usage is associated with myelotoxicity and increased risk in patients carrying metabolism-related genetic variations. This study aimed to determine the frequency of candidate gene polymorphisms and their association with 6-mercaptopurine intolerance. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 41 patients on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment were genotyped for <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i> (rs116855232) alleles, and their association with dose intensity was analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The defective <i>TPMT*3C</i> allele frequency was 9.8%. The median maintenance dose intensity for <i>TPMT*1/*3C</i> participants was considerably lower (47%) when compared with the <i>TPMT*1/*1</i> wild-type (77%), although not statistically significant. <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first pharmacogenetics study carried out in a black Zimbabwean leukemia patient cohort. The high defective <i>TPMT*3C</i> (9.8%) allele frequency points to the potential utility of pharmacogenetics testing for safe usage of 6-mercaptopurine in this population.
