Genetic Polymorphism of Thiopurine S-methyltransferase in Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Jordan.
Background and Aims: It has been demonstrated that homozygote and heterozygote mutant allele carriers for thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) are at high risk of developing myelosuppression after receiving standard doses of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of TPMT deficient alleles in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Jordan and to compare it with other ethnic groups. Methods: We included 52 ALL childhood cases from King Hussein Cancer Research Center in Jordan. Genotyping of the rs1800460, rs1800462, and rs1142345 SNPs was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by sequencing. Comparisons were made with historical data for controls and for both volunteers and cases from other middle-eastern countries. Results: Mutant TPMT alleles were present in 3.8% (2/52) of patients. Allelic frequencies were 1.0% for both TPMT*B and TPMT*C. None of the patients were heterozygous or homozygous for TPMT*3A or TPMT *2. We did not find statistically significant differences in the distribution of mutant alleles between Jordan and other middle-eastern countries for both healthy volunteers or ALL patients. Conclusions: The overall frequency of TPMT mutant alleles was low and did not exhibit differences compared to other middle-eastern countries, including Jordanian studies assessing TPMT mutant alleles in healthy volunteers. The current results question the value of TPMT genotyping in the Jordanian population.
