Genetic and Epigenetic Markers of Lithium Response.
The mood stabilizer lithium represents a cornerstone in the long term treatment of bipolar disorder (BD), although with substantial interindividual variability in clinical response. This variability appears to be modulated by genetics, which has been significantly investigated in the last two decades with some promising findings. In addition, recently, the interest in the role of epigenetics has grown significantly, since the exploration of these mechanisms might allow the elucidation of the gene-environment interactions and explanation of missing heritability. In this article, we provide an overview of the most relevant findings regarding the pharmacogenomics and pharmacoepigenomics of lithium response in BD. We describe the most replicated findings among candidate gene studies, results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as well as post-GWAS approaches supporting an association between high genetic load for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and poor lithium response. Next, we describe results from studies investigating epigenetic mechanisms, such as changes in methylation or noncoding RNA levels, which play a relevant role as regulators of gene expression. Finally, we discuss challenges related to the search for the molecular determinants of lithium response and potential future research directions to pave the path towards a biomarker guided approach in lithium treatment.
