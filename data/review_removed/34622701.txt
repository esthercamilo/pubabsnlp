Impact of Automated Best Practice Advisories on Provider Response to <i>CYP2C19</i> Genotyping Results for Patients on Clopidogrel.
ObjectiveThe study objective was to examine provider acceptance and genotyping responses to a best practice advisory (BPA) concerning clopidogrel and <i>CYP2C19</i> intermediate and poor metabolizers within the context of a new pharmacogenomics program at a Midwestern health system<i>.</i> Other secondary objectives analyzed included appropriate BPA firing, the distribution of alleles in study population, indications for clopidogrel use, and impact of indication on therapy change. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, the progress of this program was assessed by quantifying how providers respond to BPAs generated in the electronic medical record (EMR), in the context of a single representative gene-drug-outcome relationship. Patient data was pulled via reports yielding patients with genotyped information in the EMR and cross-referenced with a report evaluating BPA firing occurrences. <b>Results:</b> By capturing antiplatelet therapy changes in response to <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping results, 37 patients were found that had 73 BPAs fire. Nine of those patients had alternative antiplatelet therapy ordered. Of these, 6 alternative antiplatelet therapies were ordered from the BPA. <b>Conclusion:</b> Providers utilized BPAs, but responded differently based on individual knowledge of genotypes and indications. Information obtained from this study can be used for provider education and as reference for future design and wording of BPAs.
