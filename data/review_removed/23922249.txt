Current practices regarding codeine administration among pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists.
Pharmacogenomic studies have revealed a wide variation in the metabolism of codeine to its active metabolite, morphine. A particular subset of patients, known as ultrarapid metabolizers, possesses multiple copies of the CYP2D6 gene responsible for codeine metabolism. This has been linked to serious morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients leading to considerable debate regarding the use of codeine for analgesia in the pediatric population. The current study surveyed the current practice of codeine prescription in pediatric health care providers from a single tertiary care pediatric hospital. Of the 298 responders, 43.3% (129 of 298) continue to prescribe codeine for pain management in children. The vast majority of codeine prescribers were primary health care providers (89.1%). Most of the primary care practitioners were in office-based (42.6%) or hospital-based (45.7%) group practices. There was no significant difference in codeine use based on years of experience. Given the risks associated with this practice, increased education targeting this group appears warranted.
