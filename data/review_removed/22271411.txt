Pharmacogenetics of the effects of colesevelam on colonic transit in irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea.
Protein products of klothoÎ² (KLB) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) impact fibroblast growth factor 19-mediated feedback inhibition of hepatic bile acid (BA) synthesis. Variants of KLB and FGFR4 influence colonic transit (CT) in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D).
