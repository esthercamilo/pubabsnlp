Pharmacogenetics for severe adverse drug reactions induced by molecular-targeted therapy.
Molecular-targeted drugs specifically interfere with molecules that are frequently overexpressed or mutated in cancer cells. As such, these drugs are generally considered to precisely attack cancer cells, thereby inducing fewer adverse drug reactions (ADRs). However, molecular-targeted drugs can still cause characteristic ADRs that, although rarely severe, can be life-threatening. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to predict which patients are at risk of developing ADRs after treatment with molecular-targeted therapy. The emerging field of pharmacogenetics aims to better distinguish the genetic variants associated with drug toxicity and efficacy to improve the selection of therapeutic strategies for each genetic profile. Here, we provide an overview of the current reports on the relationship between genetic variants and molecular-targeted drug-induced severe ADRs in oncology.
