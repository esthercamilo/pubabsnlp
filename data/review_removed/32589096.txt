Assessment of healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitudes, and perceived challenges of clinical pharmacogenetic testing in Egypt.
<b>Aim:</b> We evaluated healthcare practitioners' perspectives regarding clinical pharmacogenetics in Cairo, Egypt. <b>Materials & methods:</b> We administered a paper-based survey to pharmacists and physicians practicing at Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt. The survey assessed practitioners' knowledge, attitudes, and perspectives about pharmacogenetic testing. <b>Results:</b> The study included 184 respondents (67.9% pharmacists; 32.1% physicians. Overall, the pharmacogenetic knowledge was low (mean = 41.7%) but attitudes toward pharmacogenetic testing and its potential clinical application were generally positive. Pharmacists responded more favorably than physicians to statements attributing the responsibility of applying pharmacogenetics in the clinical setting to their profession. However, several challenges were identified; the most common being: lack of pharmacogenetic knowledge and skill, lack of pharmacogenetic testing devices, and limited funding. <b>Conclusion:</b> Future efforts to promote pharmacogenetic implementation should focus on foundational education, practical training, and exploration of potential funding sources.
