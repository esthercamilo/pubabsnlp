Association between genetic variants of membrane transporters and the risk of high-grade hematologic adverse events in a cohort of Mexican children with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Advances in the understanding of the pathobiology of childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have led towards risk-oriented treatment regimens and markedly improved survival rates. However, treatment-related toxicities remain a major cause of mortality in developing countries. One of the most common adverse effects of chemotherapy in B-ALL is the hematologic toxicity, which may be related to genetic variants in membrane transporters that are critical for drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. In this study we detected genetic variants present in a selected group genes of the <i>ABC</i> and <i>SLC</i> families that are associated with the risk of high-grade hematologic adverse events due to chemotherapy treatment in a group of Mexican children with B-ALL.
