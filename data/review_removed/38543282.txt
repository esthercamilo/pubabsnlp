Exploring Variability in Rifampicin Plasma Exposure and Development of Anti-Tuberculosis Drug-Induced Liver Injury among Patients with Pulmonary Tuberculosis from the Pharmacogenetic Perspective.
Genetic polymorphisms can exert a considerable impact on drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and the development of adverse drug reactions (ADR). However, the effect of genetic polymorphisms on the anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drug, and particularly rifampicin (RIF), exposure or anti-TB drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains uncertain. Here, we evaluated the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected in the RIF pharmacogenes (<i>AADAC</i>, <i>SLCO1B1</i>, <i>SLCO1B3</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>, and <i>NR1I2</i>) and RIF PK parameters, as well as anti-TB treatment-associated DILI. In total, the study enrolled 46 patients with drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. The RIF plasma concentration was measured using the LC-MS/MS method in the blood samples collected pre-dose and 2 and 6 h post-dose, whilst the DILI status was established using the results from blood biochemical analysis performed before and 10-12 days after treatment onset. The genotyping was conducted using a targeted NGS approach. After adjustment for confounders, the patients carrying the rs3732357 GA/AA genotype of the <i>NR1I2</i> gene were found to have significantly lower RIF plasma AUC<sub>0-6 h</sub> in comparison to those with GG genotype, while the difference in RIF plasma C<sub>max</sub> was insignificant. None of the analyzed SNPs was related to DILI. Hence, we are the first to report <i>NR1I2</i> intronic SNP rs3732357 as the genetic component of variability in RIF exposure. Regarding anti-TB treatment-associated DILI, the other preexisting factors promoting this ADR should be considered.
