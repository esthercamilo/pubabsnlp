Establishment of a forward primers-superposed amplification analysis for accurate aspirin pharmacogenomic measurement.
Genotyping of gDNA rs12041331 (PEAR1), rs6065 (GP1BA), and rs730012 (LTC4S) can provide systematic guidance on the use of aspirin. However, an accurate, reliable and economical approach to simultaneous detection of the above single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is not reported. Herein, we designed and substantiated an allele-specific (AS) forward primer-superposed amplification analysis for measurement of the SNPs in PEAR1, GP1BA and LTC4S genes, in which the values of âˆ†Cq (differences in threshold cycles between the wild-type forward primer-based assay and the mutated-type forward primer-based assay) were employed to decide genotype. Mismatch AS forward primers were screened with the singleplex amplification analysis. Moreover, Cq extension optimized by AS forward primer superposition was observed in the selected forward primer-based triplex analysis. Further, robustness assessment of the triplex analysis showed the amplification efficiency ranging from 0.9 to 1.1. Precision test demonstrated the coefficient of variation of less than 2%. And the detective results of 189 DNA samples was completely concordant with that of commercial Sanger sequencing. In summary, we developed a simple, accurate and economical approach to genotyping of rs12041331 (PEAR1), rs6065 (GP1BA) and rs730012 (LTC4S) to provide a valuable pharmacogenomics tool for guidance of aspirin delivery.
