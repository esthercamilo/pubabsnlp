Experience and expectations of pharmacogenetic tests in France.
Although French genomic medicine is reaching a turning point in its history and the implementation of genome sequencing in routine is being implemented as part of the France Genomic Medicine 2025 Plan (FGMP), many questions about secondary data management remain to be addressed. In particular, the use of pharmacogenetic (PGx) information that can be extracted from genome data is a concern. We sought to analyze the opinion of French health professionals on their desire to have access to this information. For this purpose, we created a 22-item questionnaire on the experiences, attitudes, expectations, and knowledge of French physicians and pharmacists about PGx. We collected the responses in different groups and determined a knowledge score with the last 3Â questions of the questionnaire. Then, we built a prediction model for this score and determined which factors may influence it. Half of the responders were physicians (158/311) and the other half were pharmacists (153/311), and the majority of them worked in a hospital (265/311). Almost two third (62.7%, 195/311) of the responders thought that pharmacogenetic data should be communicated with genomic results for the primary indication within the framework of FGMP, and 89.1% (277/311) of them that PGx tests could be an interesting tool to optimize patients' drug therapy in the future. Only 11.2% (35/311) of the responders reached the maximum knowledge score, while 25.4% (76/311) had already prescribed or recommended a PGx test. This study identified a need for training for French physicians and pharmacists in PGx, particularly given the interest of health professionals in it.
