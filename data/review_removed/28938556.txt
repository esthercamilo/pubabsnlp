<i>ABCG2</i> and <i>NCF4</i> polymorphisms are associated with clinical outcomes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients treated with R-CHOP.
The impact of pharmacogenetics on predicting survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unclear. We tested 337 DLBCL patients treated with rituximab-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) for 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 6 genes (<i>CD20</i>, <i>FCGR2A</i>, <i>NAD(P)H, ABCC2</i>, <i>ABCG2</i> and <i>CYP3A5</i>). Patients who carried the <i>NCF4</i> rs1883112 GG genotype showed significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (<i>P</i> = 0.023) and event-free survival (EFS) (<i>P</i> < 0.001) comparing with A allele. A significantly shortened PFS (<i>P</i> = 0.013) and EFS (<i>P</i> = 0.002) was also observed in the patients with <i>ABCG2</i> rs2231137 GG genotype. Furthermore, the elder (> 60 years old) or male patients with <i>ABCG2</i> rs2231137 GG genotype had poorer PFS and EFS than A allele. Moreover, <i>CD20</i> rs2070770 CC and <i>RAC2</i> rs13058338 AT genotypes were independent predictors of chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Cox proportional hazards analyses demonstrated that the GG genotype of <i>ABCG2</i> rs2231137 and <i>NCF4</i> rs1883112 were risk factors in DLBCL patients. In conclusion, the identified polymorphisms provide guide for the identification of DLBCL patients who are likely to benefit from chemotherapy.
