Attitudes toward pharmacogenetics in patients undergoing <i>CYP2C19</i> testing following percutaneous coronary intervention.
<b>Aim:</b> Patient knowledge and attitudes toward pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing may impact adoption of clinical testing. <b>Methods:</b> Questionnaires regarding knowledge, attitudes and ethics of PGx testing were distributed to 504 patients enrolled in the ADAPT study conducted at two urban hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. Responses were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> 311 completed the survey (62% response rate). 74% were unaware of PGx testing, but 79% indicated using PGx results to predict medication efficacy was important. In a multivariable model, higher education level (p = 0.031) and greater genetics knowledge (p < 0.001) were associated with more positive attitudes toward PGx testing. <b>Conclusion:</b> Greater patient knowledge of genetics was associated with a more positive attitude toward PGx testing, indicating that educational strategies aimed at increasing genetics knowledge may enhance adoption of PGx testing in the clinic.
