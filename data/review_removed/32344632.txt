Pharmacogenomic Markers of Methotrexate Response in the Consolidation Phase of Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment.
Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the staples of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. MTX targets the folate metabolic pathway (FMP). Abnormal function of the enzymes in FMP, due to genetic aberrations, leads to adverse drug reactions. The aim of this study was to investigate variants in pharmacogenes involved in FMP and their association with MTX pharmacokinetics (MTX elimination profile) and toxicity in the consolidation therapy phase of pediatric ALL patients. Eleven variants in the thymidylate synthetase (<i>TYMS</i>), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (<i>MTHFR</i>)<i>,</i> dihydrofolate reductase (<i>DHFR</i>), <i>SLC19A1</i> and <i>SLCO1B</i> genes were analyzed in 148 patients, using PCR- and sequencing-based methodology. For the Serbian and European control groups, data on allele frequency distribution were extracted from in-house and public databases. Our results show that the A allele of <i>SLC19A1</i> c.80 variant contributes to slow MTX elimination. Additionally, the AA genotype of the same variant is a predictor of MTX-related hepatotoxicity. Patients homozygous for <i>TYMS</i> 6bp deletion were more likely to experience gastrointestinal toxicity. No allele frequency dissimilarity was found for the analyzed variants between Serbian and European populations. Statistical modelling did not show a joint effect of analyzed variants. Our results indicate that <i>SLC19A1</i> c.80 variant and <i>TYMS</i> 6bp deletion are the most promising pharmacogenomic markers of MTX response in pediatric ALL patients.
