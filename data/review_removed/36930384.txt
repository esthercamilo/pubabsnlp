Genetic polymorphisms of pharmacogenomic VIP variants in the Hui population from Ningxia Province of China.
Pharmacogenomics has been widely used to study the very important pharmacogenetic (VIP) variants among different populations. However, there is little pharmacogenomic information about the Chinese Hui population. Our research aimed to reveal the outstandingly different loci in the Hui population, and provide a theoretical foundation for personalized drug use in the Hui population, so as to facilitate more effective treatment of diseases. This study genotyped 53 VIP variants of 26 genes in 200 independent Hui individuals based on the Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB). Remarkable differences in the genotype and allele frequencies between the Hui and 26 other populations from the 1000 Genomes Project were assessed using the Ï‡<sup>2</sup> test. The genotype and allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PTGS2 (rs20417), NAT2 (rs1801280), NAT2 (rs1208), ACE (rs4291), and CYP2D6 (rs1065852) were considerably different in the Hui population compared with those in the other 26 populations. Besides, using the PharmGKB database, we identified several VIP variants that may alter the drug metabolism of ibuprofen, rofecoxib (PTGS2), captopril (ACE), citalopram, and escitalopram (CYP2D6). We also discovered other variants associated with adverse reactions to cisplatin and cyclophosphamide (NAT2). Our study indicated that the loci of PTGS2 (rs20417), NAT2 (rs1801280 and rs1208), ACE (rs4291), and CYP2D6 (rs1065852) in the Hui population were obviously different from those in the other 26 populations, which provides reliable information for predicting drug efficacy. Besides, it supplements the pharmacogenomic knowledge of the Hui population and lays the foundation for the individualized treatment for the Hui population.
