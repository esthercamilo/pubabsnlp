Effect of pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics in adults with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation conditioned with Busulfan.
Busulfan (Bu) combined with cyclophosphamide (Cy) is commonly used as a myeloablative conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). There is inter-individual variability of Bu pharmacokinetics (PK) and hence in toxicity and efficacy. The introduction of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of Bu has decreased toxicity of the regimen. Hepatic metabolism of Bu is mediated through Glutathione-S-Transferases (GSTs), mainly GSTA1. Patients with GSTA1*A variants are considered normal metabolizers and GSTA1*B corresponds to poor metabolism, defined by nucleotide changes at -52 or -69 locus in GSTA1 promoter region. The aim of the study was to explore the correlation between GSTA1 polymorphisms and Bu-PK in 60 adult patients receiving an allo-HCT in the BuCyBu clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov I, ID NCT01779882) comparing the sequence BuCy to CyBu. DNA samples prior to conditioning were genotyped for candidate variants at -52 (rs3957356) and -69 (rs3957357) loci in the GSTA1 promoter. Thirty-three % of patients were GSTA1*A*A, 49% GSTA1*A*B and 18% GSTA1*B*B. In GSTA1*A*A patients, median Bu-AUC was 3.6 ± 0.7 mg*h/L, in GSTA1*A*B 4.5 ± 1.6 and in GSTA1*B*B 4.9 ± 1.4 (AUC 35% higher than GSTA1*A*A, p = 0.03), with a similar significant correlation with Bu-clearance (p = 0.04). The correlation between GSTA1 polymorphism and AUC remained significant in multivariate linear regression analysis. There was a trend for lower non-relapse mortality (NRM) in patients with low AUC. We could not demonstrate a correlation between GSTA1 polymorphisms and NRM, acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) in this small cohort, but there is a trend of higher aGvHD incidence in GSTA1*B*B patients.
