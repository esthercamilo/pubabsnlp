The influence of pharmacogenetics and cofactors on clinical outcomes in kidney transplantation.
Immunosuppressive drugs have a narrow therapeutic range and large inter-individual response variability. This has prompted pharmacogenetic studies, mostly with regard to their dose-concentration relationships, but also about proteins involved in their pharmacodynamics. Some polymorphisms of genes involved in their disposition pathways were shown to affect their dose-concentration relationships. The impact of pharmacogenetics on tissue distribution and the resulting clinical effects have less often been studied. More importantly, a few single nucleotide polymorphisms seem to have a significant impact on the incidence of acute rejection or the adverse effects of immunosuppressants. Environmental factors often interact with such genotype-phenotype relationships.
