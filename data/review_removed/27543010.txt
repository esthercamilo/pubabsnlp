Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA gene expression microarrays: Influence on platelet reactivity, clopidogrel response and drug-induced toxicity.
Genetic and epigenetic variability may influence the efficacy and safety of antiplatelet therapies, including clopidogrel. Therefore, the miRNA-mRNA interactions and drug toxicity were investigated in silico using available microarray data. Expressions profiles of platelet miRNA (GSE59488) from acute coronary syndrome and mRNA in peripheral blood cells (GSE32226) from coronary artery disease patients were used to miRNA-target mRNA integrated analysis by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis 6 software (IPA). Results showed that ST13 mRNA is regulated by hsa-miR-107 (miR-103-3p); BTNL3 and CFD mRNAs are regulated by hsa-miR-4701-3p (miR-1262); SLC7A8 is regulated by hsa-miR-145-5p (miR-145-5p); and SENP5 mRNA is regulated by hsa-miR-15b-5p (miR-16-5p) and hsa-miR-26a-5p (miR-26a-5p). Drug toxicity IPA tool showed that these miRNAs/mRNAs are associated with clopidogrel-related liver and renal injury. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that differential expression of miRNAs in platelets and interactions with their target mRNAs are associated with variability in platelet reactivity, clopidogrel response and drug-induced toxicity.
