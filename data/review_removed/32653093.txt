[Summary of the recommendations of the International Association of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Clinical Toxicology (IATDMCT) on the therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus].
Recently, the International Association of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (IATDMCT), that is the learning society for biological pharmacology and toxicology, issued recommendations on the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of tacrolimus. This is the second consensus after the one issued in 2009. In this document, the role of tacrolimus TDM for the four principal transplanted organs is discussed. The analytical aspects, pharmacogenetics, TDM alternative approaches and the positioning of biomarkers are also presented. Stronger recommendations are about trough concentration targets in kidney and liver transplantation and for other indication of tacrolimus use. For the first time, an area under the curve of tacrolimus concentrations target is recommended for recipients management. Eventually, another set of recommendations are proposed for pharmacodynamic biomarkers used in patients' follow-up.
