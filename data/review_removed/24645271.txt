[Pharmacogenomics of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients from Yakutia].
DNA polymorphism is an important component of the interindividual variation in reactions of patients to the same drugs. In this work, evaluation of the association between polymorphisms in 106 genes involved in key processes of cellular activity (xenobiotic metabolism, DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis), and outcomes in a cohort of Yakut ovarian cancer patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy was carried out. The polymorphism in the CDKN1B gene (rs34330) was found to be associated with complete tumor response and progression-free survival. SNPs in EPXH1 gene (rs2234922 and rs2260863) were correlated with hearing impairment. A SNP in NBN gene (rs1063045) was associated with severe emesis.
