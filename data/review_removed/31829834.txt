Effects of pharmacogenetic variants on vemurafenib-related toxicities in patients with melanoma.
<b>Aim:</b> The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vemurafenib are characterized by a wide interpatient variability. Since multiple polymorphic enzymes and drug transporters are involved in vemurafenib pharmacokinetics, we studied associations of polymorphisms on vemurafenib-associated toxicities. <b>Patients & methods:</b> Prospectively collected samples of 97 melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib alone (n = 62) or in combination with cobimetinib (n = 35) were genotyped for <i>ABCB1</i> (3435C>T), <i>ABCG2</i> (421C>A, 34G>A) and <i>CYP3A4</i> (<i>*22</i>, 15389C>T) polymorphisms. Associations between these variants and the incidence of toxicities were studied. <b>Results:</b><i>CYP3A4*22</i> was significantly associated with increased risk for grade ≥3 nausea, grade 1-4 hyperbilirubinemia, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. <i>ABCB1</i> 3435C>T was a predictor for grade ≥3 toxicity. <b>Conclusion:</b> Genetic variants in <i>CYP3A4</i> and <i>ABCB1</i> are associated with vemurafenib-associated toxicities.
