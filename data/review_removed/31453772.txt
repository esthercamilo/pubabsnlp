Implementation of pharmacogenetics in a clozapine treatment resistant patient: a case report.
We report the case of a young Caucasian male with disorganized chronic schizophrenia, an active smoker and nonresponder to 400 mg of clozapine/day. Therapeutic clozapine monitoring was analyzed revealing a low clozapine:norclozapine ratio. An additional pharmacogenetic test was carried out showing that the patient carried <i>*1F</i> variant (<i>CYP1A2</i> gene), which has been associated with nonresponse to clozapine in smoker patients. A genetic variation in the <i>SLC6A4</i> gene was also found, which could be related to the poor response to clozapine. The remainder of the genes analyzed (<i>CYP2D6</i>, <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>HTR2A</i>) were not directly associated with the patient's phenotype. The dose of clozapine was increased to 600 mg/day, reaching the therapeutic range. This case shows how pharmacogenetics can help in understanding the value of plasma levels to provide clinical improvement.
