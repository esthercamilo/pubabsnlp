Association of <i>CYP2D6</i> genotype predicted phenotypes with oxycodone requirements and side effects in children undergoing surgery.
Oxycodone is a commonly used oral opioid in children for treating postoperative pain. Highly polymorphic gene <i>CYP2D6</i> metabolizes oxycodone into its more potent metabolite, oxymorphone. We hypothesized that altered activity due to <i>CYP2D6</i> polymorphisms will influence oxycodone requirements {relative oxycodone use [oxycodone morphine equivalents (MEq)/total MEq] to maintain analgesia} (primary outcome) and risk for oxycodone induced side-effects such as respiratory depression (RD) and emesis (secondary outcomes). We also explored the influence of genotype availability and provider guidance on oral opioid prescription patterns.
