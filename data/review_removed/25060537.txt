From the era of genome analysis to the era of genomic drug discovery: a pioneering example of rheumatoid arthritis.
Although we have obtained comprehensive catalogs of genetic risk loci that are linked to human diseases, little is known regarding how to devise a systematic strategy to integrate genetic study results with diverse biological resources. Such strategies will be crucial for providing novel insights into disease biology and for aiding drug discovery as an ultimate goal. Here we describe the current progress in this field using a pioneering example of large-scale genetic association studies on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and destruction of joints. Through functional and bioinformatic annotations of risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes from >100 RA risk loci identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, we found novel biological insights into RA pathogenicity. Further, by integrating RA genetic findings with the complete catalog of approved drugs for RA and other diseases, we provide empirical data to indicate that human genetic-based approaches may be useful for supporting 'genetics-driven genomic drug discovery' efforts in complex human traits and suggest that further development of integrative approaches should be undertaken.
