The effect of CYP1A2 gene polymorphisms on Theophylline metabolism and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Turkish patients.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 gene polymorphisms are thought to be involved in the metabolism of theophylline (TP). We aimed to investigate the effect of CYP1A2*1C, CYP1A2*1D, CYP1A2*1E, and CYP1A2*1F polymorphisms of the CYP1A2 on TP metabolism by PCR-RFLP in 100 Turkish patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) receiving TP. One hundred and one healthy volunteers were included as control group. The genotype frequencies of the CYP1A2*1D and CYP1A2*1F were found to be significantly different in the patients compared to the controls. The "T" allele at -2467 delT and the "C" allele at -163 C > A in the CYP1A2 displayed association with a significantly increased risk for COPD. "T" allele at - 2467 delT was also associated with a high risk of disease severity in COPD. In conclusion, our data suggest that genetic alterations in CYP1A2 may play a role both in the pharmacogenetics of TP and in the development of COPD.
