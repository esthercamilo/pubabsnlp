Development of a Pharmacogenetic Lab-on-Chip Assay Based on the In-Check Technology to Screen for Genetic Variations Associated to Adverse Drug Reactions to Common Chemotherapeutic Agents.
Antineoplastic agents represent the most common class of drugs causing Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). Mutant alleles of genes coding for drug-metabolizing enzymes are the best studied individual risk factors for these ADRs. Although the correlation between genetic polymorphisms and ADRs is well-known, pharmacogenetic tests are limited to centralized laboratories with expensive or dedicated instrumentation used by specialized personnel. Nowadays, DNA chips have overcome the major limitations in terms of sensibility, specificity or small molecular detection, allowing the simultaneous detection of several genetic polymorphisms with time and costs-effective advantages. In this work, we describe the design of a novel silicon-based lab-on-chip assay able to perform low-density and high-resolution multi-assay analysis (amplification and hybridization reactions) on the In-Check platform.
