Genetic diversity of cytochrome P450 in patients receiving psychiatric care in Greece: a step towards clinical implementation.
<b>Aim:</b> We herein inferred the genetic diversity of CYP450 isoenzymes to predict the percentage of patients who need dose adjustment in drugs used in psychiatry. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Data of 784 Greek patients receiving psychiatric care who were genotyped for CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, CYP3A5 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes were inferred to gene-drug pairs according to the US FDA, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium and Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group annotations and published literature. <b>Results:</b> Atypical metabolism was found for 36.8% of patients in CYP2D6, 49.2% in CYP2C19, 45% in CYP1A2, 16.7% in CYP3A5 and 41.8% in CYP2C9. Dosage adjustment need was estimated for 10.2% of venlafaxine, 10.0% of paroxetine, 6.4% of sertraline, 30.8% of citalopram, 52.1% of escitalopram, 18.2% of fluvoxamine, 54.1% of tricyclic antidepressants, 16.7% of zuclopenthixol, 10.6% of haloperidolÂ and 13.3% of risperidone treated patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> Clinical psychiatric pharmacogenomic implementation holds promise to improve drug effectiveness and safety.
