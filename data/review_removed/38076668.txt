Relationship of <i>CYP3A4*1B</i> Single Nucleotide Polymorphism to the Efficiency and Safety Profiles of Haloperidol in Patients Enduring Acute Alcoholic Hallucinosis.
To date, haloperidol has been widely used to treat patients with acute alcoholic hallucinosis. There is strong evidence that haloperidol therapy is commonly associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The 392A > <i>G</i> polymorphism of the <i>CYP3A4</i>*<i>1B</i> gene (rs2740574) is known to affect the metabolism rates of haloperidol; hence it correlates with both therapy efficacy and safety parameters.
