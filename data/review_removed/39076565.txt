Correlation between Metabolic Parameters and Warfarin Dose in Patients with Heart Valve Replacement of Different Genotypes.
Warfarin has become the first choice for anticoagulation in patients who need lifelong anticoagulation due to its clinical efficacy and low price. However, the anticoagulant effect of warfarin is affected by many drugs, foods, etc. accompanied by a high risk of bleeding and embolism. The Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (<i>VKORC1</i>) and Cytochrome P450 2C9 (<i>CYP2C9</i>) genotypic variation can influence the therapeutic dose of warfarin. However, it is not clear whether there is a correlation between warfarin dose and liver function, kidney function and metabolic markers such as uric acid (UA) in patients with different genotypes. We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study to evaluate the factors affecting warfarin dose and to establish a dose conversion model for warfarin patients undergoing heart valve replacement.
