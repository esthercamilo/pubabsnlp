Institutional Profile: The University of California Pharmacogenomics Center: at the interface of genomics, biological mechanisms and drug therapy.
The Pharmacogenomics Center of the University of California, San Francisco (CA, USA) fosters research and educational activities focused on the genomic basis for variation in drug response. Investigators in the Center conduct multidisciplinary and multicenter research on a diverse array of clinically used drugs with the goal of understanding the genetic factors that contribute to variation in therapeutic and adverse drug response. The Center houses the large NIH-supported Pharmacogenomics of Membrane Transporters Project, which is a leader in understanding genetic variation in membrane transporters that are important in clinical drug response. Center investigators study racially and ethnically diverse populations, are pioneers in the education of PharmD, MD and PhD students in pharmacogenomics, and have led the establishment of unique graduate and postdoctoral training programs focused on pharmacogenomics. A key emphasis of the Center is on biological mechanisms with a goal of facilitating the development of safer and more effective medications.
