Effects of CYP3A5 Polymorphism on Rapid Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease: A Prospective, Multicentre Study.
Personalised medicine is potentially useful to delay the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to determine the effects of CYP3A5 polymorphism in rapid CKD progression. This multicentre, observational, prospective cohort study was performed among adult CKD patients (≥18 years) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, who had ≥4 outpatient, non-emergency eGFR values during the three-year study period. The blood samples collected were analysed for <i>CYP3A5*3</i> polymorphism. Rapid CKD progression was defined as eGFR decline of >5 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year. Multiple logistic regression was then performed to identify the factors associated with rapid CKD progression. A total of 124 subjects consented to participate. The distribution of the genotypes adhered to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (X<sup>2</sup> = 0.237, <i>p</i> = 0.626). After adjusting for potential confounding factors via multiple logistic regression, the factors associated with rapid CKD progression were <i>CYP3A5*3/*3</i> polymorphism (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 4.190, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.268, 13.852), adjustments to antihypertensives, young age, dyslipidaemia, smoking and use of traditional/complementary medicine. CKD patients should be monitored closely for possible factors associated with rapid CKD progression to optimise clinical outcomes. The <i>CYP3A5*3/*3</i> genotype could potentially be screened among CKD patients to offer more individualised management among these patients.
