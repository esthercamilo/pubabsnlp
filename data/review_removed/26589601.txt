Genetic Factors Influencing B-type Natriuretic Peptide-Mediated Production of Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate and Blood Pressure Effects in Heart Failure Patients.
Natriuretic peptides (NPs) represent a critical pathway in heart failure (HF). We explored genetic determinants of pharmacodynamic effects of B-type NP (BNP) and changes in plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and blood pressure (BP). HF patients (n = 135) received recombinant human BNP (nesiritide) at standard doses, and plasma cGMP levels were measured at baseline and during infusion. We tested the association of 119 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 candidate genes (NPR1, NPR2, NPR3, and membrane metallo-endopeptidase (MME)) with the change in cGMP and BP. Gene-based testing for association of genetic variation with endpoints was significant only for MME. Upon individual SNP testing, two loci in MME were associated with ΔcGMP; another (rs16824656) showed association with BP change. In summary, the pharmacodynamic effects of BNP vary substantially in HF patients and are associated with genetic variation in MME. MME genetic variation may be an important determinant of NP-mediated effects in humans.
