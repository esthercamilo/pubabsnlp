Interethnic differences in the prevalence of main cardiovascular pharmacogenetic biomarkers.
<b>Background:</b> The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of <i>CYP2C9</i>, <i>VKORC1</i>, <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>SLCO1B1</i> genes polymorphisms among residents of the Volga region (Chuvash and Mari) and northernÂ Caucasus (Kabardins and Ossetians). <b>Materials & methods:</b> The study involved 845 apparently healthy volunteers of both sexes of the four different ethnic groups living in the Russian Federation: 238 from the Chuvash ethnic group, 206 Mari, 157 Kabardins and 244 Ossetians. <b>Results:</b> Significant differences were identified in allele frequency of <i>CYP2C9</i>, <i>VKORC1</i>, <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>SLCO1B1</i> genes polymorphisms between the Chuvash and Kabardins, Chuvash and Ossetians, Mari and Kabardians, Mari and Ossetians.
