Genetic variation of pharmacogenomic VIP variants in Zhuang nationality of southern China.
Drug gene polymorphisms are strongly associated with disease. Previous studies have shown that the frequency of drug genes varies in different populations. At present, there are no reports about the polymorphism of the drug genome in the Zhuang population in southern China. This study conducted a pharmacogenomics study on the Zhuang population in southern China. Therefore, we conducted genotyping on 105 Zhuang samples, and compared the genotyping results with those of other 11 ethnic groups after statistical analysis. Our results show that, compared with the 11 populations in the HapMap data set, the differences between the CYP2E1 rs2070676 and CYP2D6 rs1065852 of the Zhuang nationality are the largest. This study fills in the blank of the drug genome information of the Zhuang nationality in southern China. The two sites of Rs2070676 (CYP2E1) and rs1065852 (CYP2D6) provide a reliable basis for the prediction of the efficacy of certain drugs. Its main purpose is to provide theoretical basis for safe drug use in the Zhuang region of southern China.
