Four decades of modern pharmacogenomics: from promise to clinical utility. World PGX Summit 2011. Boston, USA, 26-27 April, 2011.
The World PGX Summit was held in Boston and preceded by a 1-day workshop. The conference aimed at assessing the current 'state-of-the art' in advanced molecular profiling strategies for increased drug development success. The topics varied from regulatory policies, pharmaceutical case examples and vendor presentations on innovative technologies. The subject is obviously closely related to personalized medicine and it was interesting to hear the perspectives from healthcare providers and subscribers. It became clear during the meeting that we are on the verge of important changes in how pharmaceutical research and development operates but also how increased costs and high unmet medical needs require new models in which pharmacogenomics can play an important role.
