Chronic Doxepin Toxicity Masquerading as Epilepsy in a 10-Year-Old Boy.
Chronic tricyclic antidepressant toxicity is rarely described in children. Symptoms include confusion, ataxia, and seizures. Toxicity may result from dosing error, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genetic variability, and drug-drug interactions. Chronic doxepin toxicity has not been previously reported in children. Doxepin is prescribed for insomnia and depression, with a maximum off-label dose of 3Â mg/kg in children. We present a case of chronic doxepin toxicity mimicking epilepsy in a child attributable to three potential factors: supratherapeutic dosing, pharmacogenomic variability, and drug-drug interactions.
