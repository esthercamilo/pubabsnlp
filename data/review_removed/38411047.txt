Delayed gametocyte clearance in <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria is associated with polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR).
Primaquine (PQ) is the main drug used to eliminate dormant liver stages and prevent relapses in <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria. It also has an effect on the gametocytes of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>; however, it is unclear to what extent PQ affects <i>P. vivax</i> gametocytes. PQ metabolism involves multiple enzymes, including the highly polymorphic CYP2D6 and the cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR). Since genetic variability can impact drug metabolism, we conducted an evaluation of the effect of CYP2D6 and CPR variants on PQ gametocytocidal activity in 100 subjects with <i>P. vivax</i> malaria. To determine gametocyte density, we measured the levels of <i>pvs25</i> transcripts in samples taken before treatment (D0) and 72 hours after treatment (D3). Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to examine the effects of enzyme variants on gametocyte densities, adjusting for potential confounding factors. Linear regression models were adjusted to explore the predictors of PQ blood levels measured on D3. Individuals with the <i>CPR</i> mutation showed a smaller decrease in gametocyte transcript levels on D3 compared to those without the mutation (<i>P</i> = 0.02, by GEE). Consistent with this, higher PQ blood levels on D3 were associated with a lower reduction in <i>pvs25</i> transcripts. Based on our findings, the <i>CPR</i> variant plays a role in the persistence of gametocyte density in <i>P. vivax</i> malaria. Conceptually, our work points to pharmacogenetics as a non-negligible factor to define potential host reservoirs with the propensity to contribute to transmission in the first days of CQ-PQ treatment, particularly in settings and seasons of high <i>Anopheles</i> human-biting rates.
