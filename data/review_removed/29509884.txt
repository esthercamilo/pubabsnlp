Pharmacogenetics of the anti-HCV drug sofosbuvir: a preliminary study.
Sofosbuvir is a potent nucleotide HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor that is also a P-glycoprotein (encoded by the ABCB1 gene) and breast cancer resistance protein (encoded by the ABCG2 gene) substrate. Concerning previous anti-HCV therapies, pharmacogenetics had a significant impact, particularly considering the association of interleukin28B polymorphisms with dual-therapy (ribavirin + pegylated IFN) outcomes.
