Patient Perceptions and Potential Utility of Pharmacogenetic Testing in Chronic Pain Management and Opioid Use Disorder in the Camden Opioid Research Initiative.
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) has the potential to improve opioid medication management. Here, we present patient perception data, pharmacogenetic data and medication management trends in patients with chronic pain (arm 1) and opioid use disorder (arm 2) treated at Cooper University Health Care in Camden City, NJ. Our results demonstrate that the majority of patients in both arms of the study (55% and 65%, respectively) are open to pharmacogenetic testing, and most (66% and 69%, respectively) believe that genetic testing has the potential to improve their medical care. Our results further support the potential for <i>CYP2D6</i> PGx testing to inform chronic pain medication management for poor metabolizers (PMs) and ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs). Future efforts to implement PGx testing in chronic pain management, however, must address patient concerns about genetic test result access and genetic discrimination.
