Single nucleotide polymorphisms in ADAM17, IL23R and SLCO1C1 genes protect against infliximab failure in adults with Crohn's disease.
To predict primary failure of infliximab (IFX) therapy in Crohn's disease (CD) and to identify patients who maintain long-term effectiveness to IFX is currently not feasible. Some genetic variations are proposed as potential biomarkers.
