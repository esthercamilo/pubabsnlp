Clinical and genetic predictors of secondary sulfonylurea failure in Type 2 diabetes patients: the SUCLINGEN study.
<b>Background:</b> Due to several limitations in the study designs of sulfonylurea pharmacogenomics studies, we investigated the clinical and genetic predictors of secondary sulfonylurea failure in Type 2 diabetes patients. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Patients receiving the maximum sulfonylurea and metformin doses for >1 year were enrolled. Secondary sulfonylurea failure was defined as HbA1c >7.0% (>53 mmol/mol) after a 12-month follow-up. <b>Results:</b> By multivariate analysis, increased insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), baseline HbA1c >7.0%, residing in eastern Peninsular Malaysia, and the CC genotype of rs757110 <i>ABCC8</i> gene polymorphism were independent predictors of secondary sulfonylurea failure (p < 0.05) while sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia was protective against such failure (p < 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Sulfonylurea does not benefit patients with an increased risk of secondary sulfonylurea failure.
