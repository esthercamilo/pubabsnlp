A Template for Authoring and Adapting Genomic Medicine Content in the eMERGE Infobutton Project.
The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network is a national consortium that is developing methods and best practices for using the electronic health record (EHR) for genomic medicine and research. We conducted a multi-site survey of information resources to support integration of pharmacogenomics into clinical care. This work aimed to: (a) characterize the diversity of information resource implementation strategies among eMERGE institutions; (b) develop a master template containing content topics of important for genomic medicine (as identified by the DISCERN-Genetics tool); and (c) assess the coverage of content topics among information resources developed by eMERGE institutions. Given that a standard implementation does not exist and sites relied on a diversity of information resources, we identified a need for a national effort to efficiently produce sharable genomic medicine resources capable of being accessed from the EHR. We discuss future areas of work to prepare institutions to use infobuttons for distributing standardized genomic content.
