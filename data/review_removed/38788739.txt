Landscape of TPMT and NUDT15 Pharmacogenetic Variation in a Cohort of Canadian Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.
Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit considerable interindividual variability in medication response, highlighting the need for precision medicine approaches to optimize and tailor treatment. Pharmacogenetics (PGx) offers the ability to individualize dosing by examining genetic factors underlying the metabolism of medications such as thiopurines. Pharmacogenetic testing can identify individuals who may be at risk for thiopurine dose-dependent adverse reactions including myelosuppression. We aimed to evaluate PGx variation in genes supported by clinical guidelines that inform dosing of thiopurines and characterize differences in the distribution of actionable PGx variation among diverse ancestral groups.
