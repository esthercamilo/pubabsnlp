Influence of ABCB1, CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 gene polymorphisms on prothrombin time and the residual equilibrium concentration of rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in real clinical practice.
The study of ABCB1 and CYP3A4/3A5 gene polymorphism genes is promising in terms of their influence on prothrombin time variability, the residual equilibrium concentration of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation and the development of new personalized approaches to anticoagulation therapy in these patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of ABCB1 (rs1045642) C>T; ABCB1 (rs4148738) C>T and CYP3A5 (rs776746) A>G, CYP3A4*22(rs35599367) C>T gene polymorphisms on prothrombin time level and residual equilibrium concentration of rivaroxaban in patients with atrial fibrillation.
