Pharmacogenomic testing in oncology: a health system's approach to identify oncology provider perspectives.
<b>Aim:</b> Identify oncology healthcare providers' attitudes toward barriers to and use cases for pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing and implications for prescribing anticancer and supportive care medications. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A questionnaire was designed and disseminated to 71 practicing oncology providers across the MedStar Health System. <b>Results:</b> 25 of 70 (36%) eligible oncology providers were included. 88% were aware of PGx testing and 72% believed PGx can improve care. Of providers who had ordered a medication with PGx implications in the past month, interest in PGx for anticancer (90-100%) and supportive care medications (>75%) was high. Providers with previous PGx education were more likely to have ordered a test (odds ratio: 7.9; 95% CI: 1.1-56; p = 0.0394). <b>Conclusion:</b> Oncology provider prescribing practices and interest in PGx suggest opportunities for implementation.
