Brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met and CYP2B6 polymorphisms as predictors for ketamine effectiveness in patients with treatment-resistant depression.
Converging lines of evidence indicate that ketamine is a rapid antidepressant for individuals with treatment-resistant depression. Hitherto, no reliable a priori predictors of ketamine response have been reported. Pharmacogenetic biomarkers have yielded mixed results regarding potential candidate genes associated with ketamine's biochemistry as reliable predictors of response.
