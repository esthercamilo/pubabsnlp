An intensive longitudinal examination of topiramate treatment for alcohol use disorder: a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial.
Previous findings have been equivocal as to whether a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2832407) in GRIK1, which encodes a glutamate receptor subunit, moderates the effects of topiramate treatment for drinking reduction. We leveraged intensive longitudinal data to provide greater precision and allow an examination of intermediate outcomes addressing this question. We used data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the hypotheses that topiramate treatment reduces daily heavy drinking, desire to drink and positive alcohol expectancies and that these effects are stronger in rs2832407*C-allele homozygotes.
