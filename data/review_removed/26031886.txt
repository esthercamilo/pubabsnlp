Integration of Genomics in Primary Care.
Primary care is changing rapidly. The wide-scale expansion of electronic medical records is redefining the way we approach chronic disease management, and automated decision support is increasingly being leveraged to reduce risk and optimize quality. Many of these interventions are now beginning to integrate genomic data. We explore the convergence of these 2 forces (expansion of clinical informatics and integration of translational genomics), and we highlight several applications where these forces are helping our patients avoid potentially preventable events. Because gene-environment interactions are dynamic, the utility of gene-based decision support varies over time. Primary care providers will serve a key role as our patients navigate these changes.
