Determinants of early change in serum creatinine after initiation of dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy in South Africa.
Dolutegravir increases serum creatinine by inhibiting its renal tubular secretion and elimination. We investigated determinants of early changes in serum creatinine in a southern African cohort starting first-line dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy (ART).
