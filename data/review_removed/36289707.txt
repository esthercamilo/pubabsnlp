Digital Technologies: Advancing Individualized Treatments through Gene and Cell Therapies, Pharmacogenetics, and Disease Detection and Diagnostics.
Digital technologies are shifting the paradigm of medicine in a way that will transform the healthcare industry. Conventional medical approaches focus on treating symptoms and ailments for large groups of people. These approaches can elicit differences in treatment responses and adverse reactions based on population variations, and are often incapable of treating the inherent pathophysiology of the medical conditions. Advances in genetics and engineering are improving healthcare via individualized treatments that include gene and cell therapies, pharmacogenetics, disease detection, and diagnostics. This paper highlights ways that artificial intelligence can help usher in an age of personalized medicine.
