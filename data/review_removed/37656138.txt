Effects of CYP2D6 allelic variants on therapy with tamsulosin in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Tamsulosin is a first-line drug for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Despite its high ratings for efficacy and safety, these parameters may vary due toÂ genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 enzyme, which is involved in the metabolism of the drug. This variability may have great impact on the therapy of LUTS associated with BPH and may require an individualized approach to drug selection. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 on the efficacy and safety of tamsulosin therapy in patients with LUTS associated with BPH.
