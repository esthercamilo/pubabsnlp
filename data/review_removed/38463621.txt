Promoting advanced medical services in the framework of 3PM-a proof-of-concept by the "Centro" Region of Portugal.
Multidisciplinary team from three universities based in the "Centro" Region of Portugal developed diverse approaches as parts of a project dedicated to enhancing and expanding Predictive, Preventive, and Personalized Medicine (3PM) in the Region. In a sense, outcomes acted as a proof-of-concept, in that they demonstrated the feasibility, but also the relevance of the approaches. The accomplishments comprise defining a new regional strategy for implementing 3PM within the Region, training of human resources in genomic sequencing, and generating good practices handbooks dedicated to diagnostic testing via next-generation sequencing, to legal and ethical concerns, and to knowledge transfer and entrepreneurship, aimed at increasing literacy on 3PM approaches. Further approaches also included support for entrepreneurship development and start-ups, and diverse and relevant initiatives aimed at increasing literacy relevant to 3PM. Efforts to enhance literacy encompassed citizens across the board, from patients and high school students to health professionals and health students. This focus on empowerment through literacy involved a variety of initiatives, including the creation of an illustrated book on genomics and the production of two theater plays centered on genetics. Additionally, authors stressed that genomic tools are relevant, but they are not the only resources 3PM is based on. Thus, they defend that other initiatives intended to enable citizens to take 3PM should include multi-omics and, having in mind the socio-economic burden of chronic diseases, suboptimal health status approaches in the 3PM framework should also be considered, in order to anticipate medical intervention in the subclinical phase.
