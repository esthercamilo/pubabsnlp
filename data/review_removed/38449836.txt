Comparing feature selection and machine learning approaches for predicting <i>CYP2D6</i> methylation from genetic variation.
Pharmacogenetics currently supports clinical decision-making on the basis of a limited number of variants in a few genes and may benefit paediatric prescribing where there is a need for more precise dosing. Integrating genomic information such as methylation into pharmacogenetic models holds the potential to improve their accuracy and consequently prescribing decisions. Cytochrome P450 2D6 (<i>CYP2D6</i>) is a highly polymorphic gene conventionally associated with the metabolism of commonly used drugs and endogenous substrates. We thus sought to predict epigenetic loci from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to <i>CYP2D6</i> in children from the GUSTO cohort.
