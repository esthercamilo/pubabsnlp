Genome-wide analysis identify novel germline genetic variations in <i>ADCY1</i> influencing platinum-based chemotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer.
To explore the pharmacogenomic markers that affect the platinum-based chemotherapy response in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), we performed a two-cohort of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including 34 for WES-based and 433 for microarray-based analyses, as well as two independent validation cohorts. After integrating the results of two studies, the genetic variations related to the platinum-based chemotherapy response were further determined by fine-mapping in 838 samples, and their potential functional impact were investigated by eQTL analysis and <i>in vitro</i> cell experiments. We found that a total of 68 variations were significant at <i>P</i> < 1 × 10<sup>-3</sup> in cohort 1 discovery stage, of which 3 SNPs were verified in 262 independent samples. A total of 541 SNPs were significant at <i>P</i> < 1 × 10<sup>-4</sup> in cohort 2 discovery stage, of which 8 SNPs were verified in 347 independent samples. Comparing the validated SNPs in two GWAS, <i>ADCY1</i> gene was verified in both independent studies. The results of fine-mapping showed that the G allele carriers of <i>ADCY1</i> rs2280496 and C allele carriers of rs189178649 were more likely to be resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy. In conclusion, our study found that rs2280496 and rs189178649 in <i>ADCY1</i> gene were associated the sensitivity of platinum-based chemotherapy in NSCLC patients.
