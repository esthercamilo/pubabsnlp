Pharmacogenetics of pain management in Zimbabwean patients with sickle cell disease.
<b>Background:</b> Pain is a common cause of hospitalization in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. Failure to effectively control pain remains a challenge in patient care. <b>Materials & methods:</b> The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to determine the effect of <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>UGT2B7</i> polymorphisms on pain management in 106 Zimbabwean SCD patients. Participant information was collected on a questionnaire. Genotyping was conducted using the GenoPharm<sup>®</sup> pharmacogenomics open array panel containing <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>UGT</i> genetic variants implicated in opioid response. <b>Results:</b> The reduced function alleles <i>CYP2D6*17</i> and <i>*29</i> had high frequencies of 15.9% and 12.9%, respectively. <i>UGT2B7</i> rs73823859 showed a statistically significant correlation with pain levels (p = 0.0454). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study demonstrated the role of <i>UGT2B7</i> polymorphism in SCD patient pain management.
