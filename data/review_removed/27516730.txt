Pharmacometabolomics informs Pharmacogenomics.
The initial decades of the 21<sup>st</sup> century have witnessed striking technical advances that have made it possible to detect, identify and quantitatively measure large numbers of plasma or tissue metabolites. In parallel, similar advances have taken place in our ability to sequence DNA and RNA. Those advances have moved us beyond studies of single metabolites and single genetic polymorphisms to the study of hundreds or thousands of metabolites and millions of genomic variants in a single cell or subject. It is now possible to merge and integrate large data sets generated by the use of different "-omics" techniques to increase our understanding of the molecular basis for variation in disease risk and/or drug response phenotypes.
