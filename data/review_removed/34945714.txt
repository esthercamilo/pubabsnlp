The Contribution of Pharmacogenetic Drug Interactions to 90-Day Hospital Readmissions: Preliminary Results from a Real-World Healthcare System.
Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines exist for many medications commonly prescribed prior to hospital discharge, yet there are limited data regarding the contribution of gene-x-drug interactions to hospital readmissions. The present study evaluated the relationship between prescription of CPIC medications prescribed within 30 days of hospital admission and 90-day hospital readmission from 2010 to 2020 in a study population (N = 10,104) who underwent sequencing with a 14-gene pharmacogenetic panel. The presence of at least one pharmacogenetic indicator for a medication prescribed within 30 days of hospital admission was considered a gene-x-drug interaction. Multivariable logistic regression analyzed the association between one or more gene-x-drug interactions with 90-day readmission. There were 2211/2354 (93.9%) admitted patients who were prescribed at least one CPIC medication. Univariate analyses indicated that the presence of at least one identified gene-x-drug interaction increased the risk of 90-day readmission by more than 40% (OR = 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.84) (<i>p</i> = 0.01). A multivariable model adjusting for age, race, sex, employment status, body mass index, and medical conditions slightly attenuated the effect (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.02-1.73) (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Our results suggest that the presence of one or more CPIC gene-x-drug interactions increases the risk of 90-day hospital readmission, even after adjustment for demographic and clinical risk factors.
