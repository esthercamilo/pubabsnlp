Serotonin-Related Functional Genetic Variants Affect the Occurrence of Psychiatric and Motor Adverse Events of Dopaminergic Treatment in Parkinson's Disease: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
The serotonergic system is important in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis as it can take over dopamine production after a large portion of dopaminergic neurons is lost through neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of genetic variability of serotonergic genes on the occurrence of motor complications and psychiatric adverse events (AE) due to dopaminergic treatment. We enrolled 231 patients and their clinical data were collected. Genotyping was performed for eight genetic variants. Logistic regression was used for analysis. Carriers of the <i>HTR1A</i> rs6295 GC genotype (OR = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.15-5.78; <i>p</i> = 0.021), <i>TPH2</i> rs4290270 AA genotype (OR = 2.78; 95% CI = 1.08-7.03; <i>p</i> = 0.034), and at least one <i>TPH2</i> rs4570625 T allele (OR = 1.86; 95% CI = 1.00-3.44; <i>p</i> = 0.047) had increased risk for visual hallucinations (VH). Additionally, carriers of at least one <i>SLC6A4</i>&nbsp;<i>5-HTTPLR</i> rs25531 S (OR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.28-0.96; <i>p</i> = 0.037) or at least one L<sub>G</sub> allele (OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.14-0.97; <i>p</i> = 0.044) had a decreased chance for VH. Constructed haplotypes of the <i>TPH2</i> showed increased risk for VH (OR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.06-3.55; <i>p</i> = 0.032) and impulse control disorders (OR = 5.20; 95% CI = 1.86-14.50; <i>p</i> = 0.002). Finally, individual gene-gene interactions showed decreased odds for the development of motor AE. Our findings suggest that the serotonergic pathway may play an important role in the development of AE resulting from dopaminergic treatment.
