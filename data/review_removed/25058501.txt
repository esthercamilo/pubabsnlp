Gorgan (Turkmen in Iran) HLA genetics: transplantation, pharmacogenomics and anthropology.
HLA class I and II alleles have been studied in a population from Gorgan (North East Iranian city bordering Turkmenistan). This population is composed of mainly Turkmen who speak Oghuz Turkish language. Comparison of Gorgan people HLA profile has been carried out with about 7984 HLA chromosomes from other worldwide populations; extended haplotypes and three dimension genetic distances have been calculated by using neighbor-joining and correspondence relatedness analyses. Most frequent extended HLA haplotypes show a Siberian/Mediterranean admixture and closest populations are Chuvashians (North Caspian Sea, Russia) and other geographically close populations like Siberian Mansi, Buryats and other Iranians. New extended HLA haplotypes have been found, such as: A*31:01-B*35:01-DRB1*15:01-DQB1*03:01, A*01:01-B*35:01-DRB1*03:01-DQB1*02:01. Relationships of Turkmen with Kurgan (Gorgan) archaeological mounds, Scythians and Sarmatians are discussed. This study is also useful for a future transplantation Gorgan waiting list, Gorgan HLA and disease epidemiology and HLA pharmacogenomics.
