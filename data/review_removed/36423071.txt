Allelic Variants of HLA-C Upstream Region, <i>PSORS1C3</i>, <i>MICA</i>, <i>TNFA</i> and Genes Involved in Epidermal Homeostasis and Barrier Function Influence the Clinical Response to Anti-IL-12/IL-23 Treatment of Patients with Psoriasis.
Several biologic therapies have been developed to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis, with patients exhibiting different clinical benefits, possibly due to the heterogeneity of pathogenic processes underlying their conditions. Ustekinumab targets the IL-12/IL-23-p40 subunit and inhibits type-1 and type-17 T-cell responses. Although ustekinumab is effective as both short- and long-term treatment, therapeutic response varies considerably among patients. Ustekinumab biosimilars will be commercialized in the very next future, likely broadening the use of this drug in the treatment of psoriasis patients. Our pharmacogenomic study evaluated the influence of 417 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in psoriasis-risk alleles on the clinical response to ustekinumab in a cohort of 152 patients affected by moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis. Differences in SNP pattern characterizing HLA-Cw6<sup>+</sup> or HLA-Cw6<sup>-</sup> patients, showing high or low responses to ustekinumab, were also analysed. We identified twelve SNPs in HLA-C upstream region (rs12189871, rs4406273, rs9348862 and rs9368670), <i>PSORS1C3</i> (rs1265181), <i>MICA</i> (rs2523497), LCE3A-B intergenic region (rs12030223, rs6701730), <i>CDSN</i> (rs1042127, rs4713436), <i>CCHCR1</i> (rs2073719) and in <i>TNFA</i> (rs1800610) genes associated with excellent response to ustekinumab. We also found that HLA-Cw6<sup>+</sup> and HLA-Cw6<sup>-</sup> patients carried out distinct patterns of SNPs associated with different clinical responses. The assessment of HLA-C alleles, together with other genetic variants, could be helpful for defining patients who better benefit from anti-IL-12/IL-23 therapy.
