Survey of genetic counselors and clinical geneticists' use and attitudes toward pharmacogenetic testing.
Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing aims to improve therapeutic outcomes through tailoring treatment based on a patient's genetic risk for non-response and/or an adverse event. Given their expertise, geneticists could facilitate the use of PGx testing; however, the preparedness and perceived role of the clinical genetics community is unclear. To assess the attitudes, preparedness, and perceived roles of geneticists in the delivery of PGx testing, we conducted a survey of 1500 randomly selected board-certified genetic counselors and clinical geneticists in the United States [response rate: 37.8% (n = 516)]. Twelve percent of genetic counselors and 41% of clinical geneticists indicated that they had ordered or coordinated patient care for PGx testing, a seemingly high proportion at this early stage of adoption. Almost all respondents had some education on pharmacogenetics, although only 28% of counselors and 58% of clinical geneticists indicated they felt well-informed about PGx testing. About half of counselors (52%) and clinical geneticists (46%) felt they would play 'some' role in the delivery of PGx testing; 17 and 19%, respectively, felt that they would play 'no' or 'a little' role. At this early stage of PGx testing, the role of geneticists and genetic counselors is unclear. However, their experience may aid in readying PGx testing and informing delivery strategies into clinical practice.
