Genetic Association Study and Machine Learning to Investigate Differences in Platelet Reactivity in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke Treated with Aspirin.
Aspirin resistance (AR) is a pressing problem in current ischemic stroke care. Although the role of genetic variations is widely considered, the data still remain controversial. Our aim was to investigate the contribution of genetic features to laboratory AR measured through platelet aggregation with arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in ischemic stroke patients. A total of 461 patients were enrolled. Platelet aggregation was measured via light transmission aggregometry. Eighteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <i>ITGB3</i>, <i>GPIBA</i>, <i>TBXA2R</i>, <i>ITGA2</i>, <i>PLA2G7</i>, <i>HMOX1</i>, <i>PTGS1</i>, <i>PTGS2</i>, <i>ADRA2A</i>, <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>PEAR1</i> genes and the intergenic <i>9p21.3</i> region were determined using low-density biochips. We found an association of rs1330344 in the <i>PTGS1</i> gene with AR and AA-induced platelet aggregation. Rs4311994 in <i>ADRA2A</i> gene also affected AA-induced aggregation, and rs4523 in the <i>TBXA2R</i> gene and rs12041331 in the <i>PEAR1</i> gene influenced ADP-induced aggregation. Furthermore, the effect of rs1062535 in the <i>ITGA2</i> gene on NIHSS dynamics during 10 days of treatment was found. The best machine learning (ML) model for AR based on clinical and genetic factors was characterized by AUC = 0.665 and F1-score = 0.628. In conclusion, the association study showed that <i>PTGS1</i>, <i>ADRA2A</i>, <i>TBXA2R</i> and <i>PEAR1</i> polymorphisms may affect laboratory AR. However, the ML model demonstrated the predominant influence of clinical features.
