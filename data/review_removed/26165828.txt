Cytotoxicity of 35 medicinal plants from Sudan towards sensitive and multidrug-resistant cancer cells.
Cancer is a complex disease with multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations. Since decades, the hallmark of cancer therapy is chemotherapy. Cytotoxic drugs erase rapidly dividing cells without sufficient differentiation between normal and cancerous cells resulting in severe side effects in normal tissues. Recently, strategies for cancer treatment focused on targeting specific proteins involved in tumor growth and progression. The present study was designed to investigate the cytotoxicity of 65 crude extracts from 35 Sudanese medicinal plants towards various cancer cell lines expressing molecular mechanisms of resistance towards classical chemotherapeutics (two ATP-binding cassette transporters, ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCB5, tumor suppressor p53, epidermal growth factors receptor (EGFR). And the aim was to identify plant extracts and isolated compounds thereof with activity towards otherwise drug-resistant tumor cells.
