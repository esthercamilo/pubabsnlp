The impact of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz in African children.
Using a model-based approach, the efavirenz steady-state pharmacokinetics in African children is characterized, quantifying demographic and genotypic effects on the drug's disposition. Simulations are also conducted allowing prediction of optimized doses of efavirenz in this population.
