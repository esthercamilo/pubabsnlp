Pharmacogenetics of Between-Individual Variability in Plasma Clearance of Bedaquiline and Clofazimine in South Africa.
Plasma bedaquiline clearance is reportedly more rapid with African ancestry. Our objective was to determine whether genetic polymorphisms explained between-individual variability in plasma clearance of bedaquiline, its M2 metabolite, and clofazimine in a cohort of patients treated for drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa.
