Association of a Single-Nucleotide Variant rs11100494 of the <i>NPY5R</i> Gene with Antipsychotic-Induced Metabolic Disorders.
The usage of antipsychotics (APs) is the most robust and scientifically based approach in the treatment of schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs). The efficiency of APs is based on a range of target receptors of the central nervous system (CNS): serotoninergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic and cholinergic. Metabolic disorders are the most severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and lead to cardiovascular diseases with a high rate of mortality in patients with SSDs. Neuropeptide Y receptor Y5 (NPY5R) is known in the chain of interaction to target receptors for APs, agouti-related peptide receptors and proopiomelanocortin receptors. We studied the association of the single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) rs11100494 and rs6837793 of the <i>NPY5R</i> gene, and rs16147, rs5573, rs5574 of the <i>NPY</i> gene, with metabolic disorders in Russian patients with SSDs.
