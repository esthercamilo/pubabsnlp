Influence of <i>SH2B3</i>, <i>MTHFD1L</i>, <i>GGCX</i>, and <i>ITGB3</i> Gene Polymorphisms on theVariability on Warfarin Dosage Requirements and Susceptibility to CVD in the Jordanian Population.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the <i>SH2B3</i>, <i>MTHFD1L</i>, <i>GGCX</i>, and <i>ITGB3</i> gene variants on the efficacy of warfarin treatment and its effects on the risk of cardiovascular disorders in Jordanian patients. The selected genes and their polymorphisms are involved in many Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) associated with cardiovascular disease and the variability of warfarin therapy. The current study conducted a genetic association and pharmacogenetics study in (212) Jordanian cardiovascular patients treated with warfarin and (213) healthy controls. DNA extraction and the Mass ARRAYâ„¢ system were used to genotype ten selected polymorphisms within four genes (<i>SH2B3</i>, <i>MTHFD1L</i>, <i>GGCX</i>, and <i>ITGB3</i>). This study confirmed a genetic association of <i>MTHFD1L</i> rs6922269 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) with warfarin sensitivity during the initial and stabilization phases of treatment. Moreover, this SNP showed significant differences in the initial and maintenance doses of warfarin. This study also found an association between the genetic haplotypes (AGC and GAT) within the <i>SH2B3</i> gene and responsiveness to warfarin. However, possession of an <i>MTHFD1L</i> rs491552 variant allele was found to affect the outcome measure of the international normalized ratio (INR) during the stabilization phase of warfarin treatment. In contrast, there was no association between all selected SNPs and susceptibility to cardiovascular disorders. This study extends the current understanding of the high variability of the warfarin response, including variability in dose requirements and susceptibility to cardiovascular disease in the Jordanian-Arab population. Other studies on a larger sample and in different ethnic groups could help to better understand the pharmacogenetics of warfarin and its application in personalized medicine.
