The Role of Global and Local Ancestry on Clopidogrel Response in African Americans.
Pharmacogenomics has long lacked dedicated studies in African Americans, resulting in a lack of indepth data in this populations. The ACCOuNT consortium has collected a cohort of 167 African American patients on steady state clopidogrel with the goal of discovering population specific variation that may contribute to the response of this anti-platelet agent. Here we analyze the role of both global and local ancestry on the clinical phenotypes of P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) and high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) in this cohort. We found that local ancestry at the TSS of three genes, IRS-1, ABCB1 and KDR were nominally associated with PRU, and local ancestry-adjusted SNP association identified variants in ITGA2 associated to increased PRU. These finding help to explain the variability in drug response seen in African Americans, especially as few studies on genes outside of CYP2C19 has been conducted in this population.
