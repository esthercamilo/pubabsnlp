A pilot study of ADRA2A genotype association with doses of dexmedetomidine for sedation in pediatric patients.
Dexmedetomidine is titrated to achieve sedation in the pediatric and cardiovascular intensive care units (PICU and CVICU). In adults, dexmedetomidine response has been associated with an ADRA2A polymorphism (rs1800544); CC genotype is associated with an increased sedative response compared with GC and GG. To date, this has not been studied in children.
