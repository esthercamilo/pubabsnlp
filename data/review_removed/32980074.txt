Identifying End Users' Preferences about Structuring Pharmacogenetic Test Orders in an Electronic Health Record System.
Pharmacogenetics (PGx) testing can be used for detecting genetic variations that may affect an individual's anticipated metabolism of, or response to, medications. Although several studies have focused on developing tools for delivering results from PGx testing, there is a relative dearth of information about how to design provider-friendly electronic order-entry systems for PGx. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is preparing to implement a new electronic health records system. In this study, VA PGx test end users were surveyed about their preferences for how electronic test orders for PGx should be structured, including the nomenclature that should be used to search for and identify PGx-test orders, whether to offer single- versus multigene tests, and whether information about test methodology should be included in the order name. Responses were analyzed systematically to identify areas of agreement and disagreement with the survey options, and areas where respondents' opinions diverged. End users endorsed preferences for flexible ways to identify and order PGx tests and multigene panel tests; opinions on whether test methodology should be included in the test name were divergent. The results could be used for both informing the VA's new electronic health records implementation (including how PGx tests are searched for and ordered) and for providing insights for other health systems implementing PGx-testing programs.
