21-Gene recurrence scores: racial differences in testing, scores, treatment, and outcome.
African American (AA) women experience higher breast cancer mortality than white (W) women. These differences persist even among estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers. The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) predicts recurrence in patients with ER-positive/lymph node-negative breast cancer according to RS score-low risk (RS, 0-18), intermediate risk (RS, 19-31), and high risk (RS, >31). The high-risk group is most likely to benefit from chemotherapy, to achieve minimal benefit from hormonal therapy, and to exhibit lower ER levels (intrinsically luminal B cancers). In the current study, the authors investigated racial differences in RS testing, scores, treatment, and outcome.
