Individualized Drugs' Selection by Evaluation of Drug Properties, Pharmacogenomics and Clinical Parameters: Performance of a Bioinformatic Tool Compared to a Clinically Established Counselling Process.
Inefficacy and safety concerns are main medications' problems, especially in the case of poly-therapies, when drug-drug interactions may alter the expected drug disposition. Ongoing efforts are aimed to establish drug selection processes aimed to preemptive evaluation of a plethora of factors affecting patient's specific drug response, including pharmacogenomic markers, in order to minimize prescription of improper medications. In previous years, we established at the University Hospital Sant'Andrea of Rome, Italy, a Precision Medicine Service based on a multi-disciplinary experts' team. The team is in charge to produce a drug therapy counselling report, including pharmacogenomic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of this established "manual" process of therapy selection with a novel bioinformatic tool, the Drug-PIN system.
