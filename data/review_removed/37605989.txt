Pharmacogenetics of angiotensin modulators according to <i>APOE</i>-ϵ4 alleles and the <i>ACE</i> insertion/deletion polymorphism in Alzheimer's disease.
In Alzheimer's disease (AD), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) could reduce cerebrovascular dysfunction, while angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) might increase brain amyloid-β by suppressing effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 1, an amyloid-β-degrading enzyme. However, ACEis could benefit patients with AD by reducing the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein, by central cholinergic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and by peripheral modulation of glucose homeostasis. We aimed to investigate whether the <i>ACE</i> insertion/deletion polymorphism is associated with clinical changes in patients with AD, while considering apolipoprotein E (<i>APOE</i>)-ϵ4 carrier status and blood pressure response to angiotensin modulators.
