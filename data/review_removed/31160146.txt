Neuroimaging findings from an experimental pharmacology trial of naltrexone in heavy drinkers of East Asian descent.
Despite known genetic variation across races, studies examining pharmacogenetics of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) on clinical response to naltrexone have been conducted in predominantly Caucasian samples. Evidence is mixed for pharmacogenetic OPRM1 and naltrexone effects on neural responses to alcohol cues. The current study tests the pharmacogenetic effects of naltrexone and OPRM1 on neural responses to alcohol taste cues in heavy drinkers of East Asian descent.
