Use of hiPSC to explicate genomic predisposition to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.
The anticancer agents of the anthracycline family are commonly associated with the potential to cause severe toxicity to the heart. To solve the question of why particular a patient is predisposed to anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC), researchers have conducted numerous pharmacogenomic studies and identified more than 60 loci associated with AIC. To date, none of these identified loci have been developed into US FDA-approved biomarkers for use in routine clinical practice. With advances in the application of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, sequencing technologies and genomic editing techniques, variants associated with AIC can now be validated in a human model. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of known genetic variants associated with AIC from the perspective of how human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes can be used to help better explain the genomic predilection to AIC.
