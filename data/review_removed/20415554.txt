Pharmacogenetics education: 10 years of experience at Tel Aviv University.
Lack of knowledge among clinicians regarding pharmacogenetics is often cited as one of the barriers delaying its clinical uptake, albeit there are many other, more crucial aspects that impede the implementation of pharmacogenetics into routine medical practice. Pharmacogenetics has been incorporated to the MD teaching curriculum at the Tel Aviv University Faculty of Medicine (Tel Aviv, Israel) since 2001 and offered as an elective class for graduate students since 2003. I share here my pharmacogenetics teaching experience over the past decade and look forward to 2020 when - hopefully - the use of pharmacogenetics tools will have become more established in routine clinical care.
