Benchmark Software and Data for Evaluating CRISPR-Cas9 Experimental Pipelines Through the Assessment of a Calibration Screen.
Genome-wide genetic screens using CRISPR-guide RNA libraries are widely performed in mammalian cells to functionally characterize individual genes and for the discovery of new anticancer therapeutic targets. As the effectiveness of such powerful and precise tools for cancer pharmacogenomics is emerging, tools and methods for their quality assessment are becoming increasingly necessary. Here, we provide an R package and a high-quality reference data set for the assessment of novel experimental pipelines through which a single calibration experiment has been executed: a screen of the HT-29 human colorectal cancer cell line with a commercially available genome-wide library of single-guide RNAs. This package and data allow experimental researchers to benchmark their screens and produce a quality-control report, encompassing several quality and validation metrics. The R code used for processing the reference data set, for its quality assessment, as well as to evaluate the quality of a user-provided screen, and to reproduce the figures presented in this article is available at https://github.com/DepMap-Analytics/HT29benchmark. The reference data is publicly available on FigShare.
