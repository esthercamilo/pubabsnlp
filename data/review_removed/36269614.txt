Treating Hepatitis B Virus in Times of COVID-19: The Case for Clinical Pharmacogenomics Research in Tenofovir-Induced Kidney Toxicity.
The current pandemic has markedly shifted the focus of the global research and development ecosystem toward infectious agents such as SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19. A case in point is the chronic liver disease associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection that continues to be a leading cause of severe liver disease and death globally. The burden of HBV infection is highest in the World Health Organization designated western Pacific and Africa regions. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a nucleoside analogue used in treatment of HBV infection but carries a potential for kidney toxicity. TDF is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes and, therefore, its clearance in the proximal tubule of the renal nephron is controlled mostly by membrane transport proteins. Clinical pharmacogenomics of TDF with a focus on drug transporters, discussed in this perspective article, offers a timely example where resource-limited countries and regions of the world with high prevalence of HBV can strengthen the collective efforts to fight both COVID-19 and liver diseases impacting public health. We argue that precision/personalized medicine is invaluable to guide this line of research inquiry. In all, our experience in Ghana tells us that it is important not to forget the burden of chronic diseases while advancing research on infectious diseases such as COVID-19. For the long game with COVID-19, we need to address the public health burden of infectious agents and chronic diseases in tandem.
