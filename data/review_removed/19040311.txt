Use of pharmacogenetics, enzymatic phenotyping, and metabolite monitoring to guide treatment with azathioprine in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
Individualized therapy based on genetic background and monitoring of metabolites can optimize drug safety and efficacy. Such an approach is available for azathioprine (AZA), the thiopurine antimetabolite. AZA exerts therapeutic effects when metabolized to the active thiopurine nucleotide, 6-thioguanine (6-TGN). In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 6-TGN levels in the target range of 235-400 pmol/8x10(8) red blood cells (RBC) are associated with a high likelihood of response. Our objective was to evaluate whether drug escalation based on metabolite levels improves efficacy and maintains safety in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
