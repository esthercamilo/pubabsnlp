Pharmacotherapy for exercise-induced asthma: allowing normal levels of activity and sport.
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is experienced by the majority of an estimated 300 million individuals who have asthma, a condition that affects all ages and is increasing globally. Respiratory water loss with dehydration of the airways causing mediator release and airway narrowing is considered the cause of EIB, the severity of which will be increased if the inhaled air is cold or polluted. Adequate control of asthma is essential to minimize or prevent EIB and permit normal levels of physical activity and sport. This is important because exercise is a necessary component of daily living, assists in obtaining and maintaining a healthy body and has been demonstrated to benefit asthmatics. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids and inhaled β(2)-adrenoceptor agonists (IβA) are the pharmacological agents of choice to manage asthma and minimize EIB, assisted when necessary, by other drugs including leukotriene receptor antagonists and chromones. Tolerance from daily use of IβA is of concern and more flexible drug therapy needs to be considered. Optimal use of inhalers to deliver drugs effectively requires closer attention. Pharmacogenetics may hold the key to future drug therapy.
