Drugs-associated with red man syndrome: An integrative approach using disproportionality analysis and Pharmip.
Red man syndrome (RMS) is a non-IgE-mediated anaphylactoid adverse event frequently witnessed after a rapid infusion of vancomycin. This study aims to unravel drugs and associated off-label targets that induce RMS by exploiting FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and Pharmacovigilance/Pharmacogenomics Insilico Pipeline (PHARMIP).
