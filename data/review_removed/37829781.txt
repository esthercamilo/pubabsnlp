Correlation of pain perception and fentanyl consumption after major abdominal surgery with CGRP 4218T/C polymorphism: A prospective interventional study.
Genetic polymorphisms contribute to patients' variability in pain perception and response to opioid treatment. The present study evaluated the association of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) 4218T/C polymorphisms with fentanyl consumption over 24 h postoperatively in patients after major abdominal surgery.
