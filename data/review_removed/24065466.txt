Pharmacogenomics: current applications and future prospects towards personalized therapeutics.
Personalized Medicine is more than just a metabolic activity of a person. Pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics, pharmacoproteomics, and metabolomics play an important role in the development of personalized medicines. Personalized medicine uses information about a person's genes, proteins, enzyme activities, and cellular environment to diagnose and treat disease, cancer included. A major problem of personalized medicine is the fact that there is no portable bedside and low-cost bioanalytical technology that can be used in close proximity to the patient. This technology could play a significant role in defining the dosage setting for subsets of the population. The success of the personalized therapy is possible through the application of technology, which can provide a bridge between metabolism status and an individual's response to a particular drug and therapeutic modality.
