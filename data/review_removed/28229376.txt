The Pharmacogenetics of Tacrolimus in Corticosteroid-Sparse Pediatric and Adult Kidney Transplant Recipients.
Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor used as an immunosuppressant drug in solid organ transplantation, and is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)Â 3A4 and CYP3A5. Studies have shown an association between the CYP3A5 genotype and tacrolimus dose-adjusted trough concentrations. Variants in the genes PPARA, POR and CYP3A4 have recently been shown to influence tacrolimus metabolism. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic interaction between corticosteroid treatment and tacrolimus has been shown. In the present study, we investigated a potential association between CYP3A5*3, PPARA c.209-1003G>A, POR*28 and CYP3A4*22 and dose-adjusted tacrolimus trough concentrations in a primarily corticosteroid-free (>85%) population of Danish pediatric and adult kidney transplant recipients.
