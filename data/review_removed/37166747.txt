Effect of CYP2D6 pharmacogenetic phenotype and phenoconversion on serum concentrations of antidepressants and antipsychotics: a retrospective cohort study.

Including phenoconversion effects (PC) in result interpretation could maximize its potential benefits. However, studies on genetics of pharmacokinetic genes including the functional enzyme status are lacking.
