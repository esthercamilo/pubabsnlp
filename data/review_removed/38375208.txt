Pharmacogenomics and non-genetic factors affecting drug response in autism spectrum disorder in Thai and other populations: current evidence and future implications.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may affect family and social life profoundly. Although there is no selective pharmacotherapy for ASD, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recommended risperidone/aripiprazole to treat the associated symptoms of ASD, such as agitation/irritability. Strong associations of some pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic gene variants, e.g., <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>DRD2</i>, with risperidone-induced hyperprolactinemia have been found in children with ASD, but such strong genetic associations have not been found directly for aripiprazole in ASD. In addition to pharmacogenomic (PGx) factors, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and possibly cumulative effects of DDIs and PGx may affect the safety or effectiveness of risperidone/aripiprazole, which should be assessed in future clinical studies in children with ASD. Reimbursement, knowledge, and education of healthcare professionals are the key obstacles preventing the successful implementation of ASD pharmacogenomics into routine clinical practice. The preparation of national and international PGx-based dosing guidelines for risperidone/aripiprazole based on robust evidence may advance precision medicine for ASD.
