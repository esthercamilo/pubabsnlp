Rapid detection of the irinotecan-related UGT1A1 & 5-fluorouracil related DPYD polymorphism by asymmetric polymerase chain reaction melting curve analysis.
Determination of DPYD and UGT1A1 polymorphisms prior to 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan therapy is crucial for avoiding severe adverse drug effects. Hence, there is a pressing need for accurate and reliable genotyping methods for the most common DPYD and UGT1A1 polymorphisms. In this study, we introduce a novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) melting curve analysis method for discriminating DPYD c.1236G > A, c.1679 T > G, c.2846A > T, IVS14 + 1G > A and UGT1A1*1, *28, *6 (G71R) genotypes.
