The clinical pharmacogenomics implementation consortium: CPIC guideline for SLCO1B1 and simvastatin-induced myopathy.
Cholesterol reduction from statin therapy has been one of the greatest public health successes in modern medicine. Simvastatin is among the most commonly used prescription medications. A non-synonymous coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4149056, in SLCO1B1 markedly increases systemic exposure to simvastatin and the risk of muscle toxicity. This guideline explores the relationship between rs4149056 (c.521T>C, p.V174A) and clinical outcome for all statins. The strength of the evidence is high for myopathy with simvastatin. We limit our recommendations accordingly.
