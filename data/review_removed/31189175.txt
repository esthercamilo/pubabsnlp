Brain Volume-Related Polymorphisms of the Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β Gene and Their Effect on Antidepressant Treatment in Major Depressive Disorder.
Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) polymorphisms are known to influence hippocampal brain tissue volume in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the effects of the GSK-3β gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in those receiving antidepressant therapy are unknown.
