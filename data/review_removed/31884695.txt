Potential Clinical Relevance of Differences in Allele Frequencies Found within Very Important Pharmacogenes between Hmong and East Asian Populations.
Implementing pharmacogenetics for very important pharmacogenes (VIPs) holds the promise of improving clinical outcomes through optimal medication selection and dosing. However, significant differences in the frequency of actionable variants in VIPs may exist within subpopulations of a given ancestral group. Furthermore, these differences can potentially impact drug selection and dosing. The purpose of this study was to ascertain allele frequencies for VIPs and to predict medication requirements using Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines in Hmong and compare with published data for East Asians.
