Pharmacogenomics of antidepressant treatment effects.
There has been considerable promise and hope that pharmacogenomics will optimize existing treatments for major depression, as well as identify novel targets for drug discovery. Immediately after the sequencing of the human genome, there was much hope that tremendous progress in pharmacogenomics would rapidly be achieved. In the past 10 years this initial enthusiasm has been replaced by a more sober optimism, as we have gone a long way towards the goal of guiding therapeutics based on genomics. While the effort to translate discovery to clinical applications is ongoing, we now have a vast body of knowledge as well as a clear direction forward. This article will provide a critical appraisal of the state of the art in the pharmacogenomics of depression, both in terms of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.
