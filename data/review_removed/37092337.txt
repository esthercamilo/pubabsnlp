Pharmacogenomics of oxcarbazepine in the treatment of epilepsy.
Oxcarbazepine (OXC) is one of the preferred drugs for partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. However, clinical studies have found that there are considerable differences among different populations in OXC therapeutic efficacy or safety that result from the function changes of metabolic enzymes, transporters and other receptors involved in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics <i>in vivo</i>. The authors collected all the information on the clinically reported associations betweenÂ variants of common genes (e.g., <i>UGT1A9</i>, <i>HLA-B</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>) and OXC. In conclusion, these associations based on variants are beneficial for adjusting the medication regimen, which could be useful for individualized treatment with OXC.
