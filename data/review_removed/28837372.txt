Update upon efficacy and safety of etanercept for the treatment of spondyloarthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
TNF-α inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy both as monotherapy and in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the treatment of chronic inflammatory immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriasis (Ps) and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and may be administered off-label to treat disseminated granuloma annulare, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. There are several TNF-α inhibitors available for clinical use including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept. In this article, we discuss the efficacy and safety of etanercept in the treatment of spondyloarthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Etanercept is effective in the treatment of PsA, AS, JIA and uveitis. Independent predictors of achieving a sustained clinical improvement or MDA in children with JIA include shorter disease duration, no concurrent oral corticosteroid use, history of chronic anterior uveitis and age <9 years. IBD incidence was lower in patients receiving etanercept plus MTX. Intra-articular administration of etanercept seems to favor a prompt target joint improvement without serious adverse events. Etanercept improve endothelial function reducing the risk of acute cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular events. The most commonly reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis, epidermal and dermal conditions, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, headache and fatigue.
