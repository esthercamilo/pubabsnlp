Pharmacogenetics of the lipodystrophy syndrome associated with HIV infection and combination antiretroviral therapy.
Antiretroviral drugs have been associated with several toxicities that limit their success. Of the chronic toxicities, the lipodystrophy syndrome is of special concern due to the metabolic alterations that can accompany it. Why some patients treated with a particular antiretroviral regimen develop lipodystrophy, while others do not, is a medical mystery, but it has been suggested that individuals may (or may not) have a genetically conditioned predisposition. Pharmacogenetics is the science that studies how the genetic composition of individuals can give rise to interindividual variations in response to drugs and drug toxicity.
