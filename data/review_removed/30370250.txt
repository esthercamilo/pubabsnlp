Interactions Between <i>ABCB1</i> Genotype and Preoperative Statin Use Impact Clinical Outcomes Among Breast Cancer Patients.
Multiple clinical trials investigate statins' effects in breast cancer. The <i>ABCB1</i> genotype appears to influence statin response and toxicity in the cardiovascular setting. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the interplay between preoperative statin use, <i>ABCB1</i> genotype, and tumor-specific expression of the statin target 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) in breast cancer. Preoperative statin use, <i>ABCB1</i> C3435T genotype, and HMGCR expression in relation to outcome were analyzed in 985 primary breast cancer patients from a population-based prospective cohort in Sweden from 2002 to 2012. Preoperative statin use (<i>n</i> = 80) was not associated with <i>ABCB1</i> C3435T genotype (<i>n</i> = 576), HMGCR expression (<i>n</i> = 848), or clinical outcomes. <i>ABCB1</i> C3435T TT-carriers had lower risk of breast cancer events than any C-carriers (adjusted hazard ratio (HR<sub>adj</sub>) 0.74; 95%CI 0.49, 1.12), but only in non-statin users (<i>P</i> <sub><i>interactio</i></sub> <sub>n</sub> = 0.042). Statin users with TT genotype had higher risk of distant metastasis (HR<sub>adj</sub> 4.37; 95%CI 1.20, 15.91; <i>P</i> <sub><i>interaction</i></sub> = 0.009) and shorter overall survival than other patients (HR<sub>adj</sub> 3.77; 95%CI 1.37, 10.39; <i>P</i> <sub><i>interactio</i></sub> <sub>n</sub> = 0.019). In conclusion, there were nominally significant interactions between <i>ABCB1</i> genotype and preoperative statin use on clinical outcomes, while preoperative statin use was not associated with outcomes. Since this is an exploratory study of the impact of the <i>ABCB1</i> genotype in relation to statin use and clinical outcomes in the breast cancer setting, the results should be interpreted with caution and warrant replication in an independent cohort, preferably in a randomized setting. Since statin use is common in breast cancer patients, it would be of interest to further elucidate the clinical impact of the <i>ABCB1</i> genotype in breast cancer.
