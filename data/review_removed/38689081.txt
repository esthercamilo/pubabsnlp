Cuproptosis-Related Gene FDX1 Identified as a Potential Target for Human Ovarian Aging.
Cuproptosis is a recently discovered mode of cell death that has garnered attention due to its association with various diseases. However, the intricate genetic relationship between cuproptosis and ovarian aging has remained largely unexplored. This study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap by leveraging data sets related to ovarian aging and cuproptosis. Through comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, facilitated by R software, we uncovered FDX1 as a potential cuproptosis-related gene with relevance to ovarian aging. To gain insights into FDX1's role, we conducted spatial transcriptome analyses in the ovaries of both young and aged female mice. These experiments revealed a significant reduction in FDX1 expression in the aging group compared to the young group. To substantiate these findings at the genetic level, we turned to clinical infertility biopsies. Impressively, we observed consistent results in biopsies from elderly infertile patients, reinforcing the link between FDX1 and ovarian aging. Moreover, we delved into the pharmacogenomics of ovarian cell lines and discovered that FDX1 expression levels were intricately associated with heightened sensitivity to specific small molecule drugs. This observation suggests that modulating FDX1 could potentially be a strategy to influence drug responses in ovarian-related therapies. In sum, this study marks a pioneering effort in identifying FDX1 as a cuproptosis-related gene implicated in ovarian aging. These findings hold substantial promise, not only in shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of ovarian aging but also in positioning FDX1 as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target. With further research, FDX1 could play a pivotal role in advancing precision medicine and therapies for ovarian-related conditions.
