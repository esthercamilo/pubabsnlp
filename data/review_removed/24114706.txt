Genes and schizophrenia: from a Festschrift Seminar honoring William T. Carpenter Jr, MD.
Recent data have begun to elucidate the genetic architecture of schizophrenia, as well as provide new insights into the relationships of specific genetic factors across diagnostic boundaries, with specific symptom domains, and in the prediction of antipsychotic treatment response. Not surprisingly, work conducted at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center (MPRC), led by Dr William Carpenter, has helped to guide the thinking behind much of this work, as well as contributed valuable data toward these efforts. In this article, I will briefly summarize some of the major findings emerging from these lines of research and highlight the role of the Dr Carpenter and his colleagues at the MPRC in this area.
