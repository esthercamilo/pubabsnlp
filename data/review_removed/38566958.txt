Case report: Avoiding intolerance to antipsychotics through a personalized treatment approach based on pharmacogenetics.
The standard approach to treatment in psychiatry is known as "treatment as usual" (TAU), in which the same types of treatment are administered to a group of patients. TAU often requires numerous dose adjustments and medication changes due to ineffectiveness and/or the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This process is not only time-consuming but also costly. Antipsychotic medications are commonly used to treat various psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and mood disorders. Some of the inter-individual differences in efficacy and ADRs observed in psychopharmacotherapy can be explained by genetic variability in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antipsychotics. A better understanding of (in)efficacy and possible ADRs can be achieved by pharmacogenetic analysis of genes involved in the metabolism of antipsychotics. Most psychotropic drugs are metabolized by genetically variable CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 enzymes. To demonstrate the utility of pharmacogenetic testing for tailoring antipsychotic treatment, in this paper, we present the case of a patient in whom a pharmacogenetic approach remarkably altered an otherwise intolerant or ineffective conventional TAU with antipsychotics.
