Relative addictive potential of opioid analgesic agents.
Opioid overdoses and deaths continue to be a problem in the USA with a significant portion related to prescribed opioid analgesic agents. The role of pharmacogentic factors in opioid addiction is an active area of research. While all opioid analgesic agents have some addictive potential, it is clear that there are some with greater addictive potential. Oxycodone is the most widely abused opioid analgesic and it appears to predispose to chronic use with high likability by users. Fentanyl and hydromorphone are both very lipophilic allowing rapid penetration into the CNS, but are not rated as highly as other agents. Providers should consider the risk of addiction with the opioids they prescribe and give those with a lower addictive potential.
