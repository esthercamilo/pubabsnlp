Effect of L-Methylfolate Supplementation on Sleep for Patients with Reduced Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase Activity.
Clinicians have limited options outside controlled substances to address sleep disturbance, which left untreated can negatively affect patient outcomes in cardiovascular health, mental health, immunologic function, and more. For some, genetic factors may influence sleep disturbances. L-methylfolate, the active form of folate, plays a critical role in regulation of monoamine neurotransmitters known to have significant impact on sleep regulation: dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the enzyme methylene-tetrahydrofolate-reductase are common and can impact monoamine production. The goal of this study was to evaluate effects of L-methylfolate supplementation on sleep in a cohort with reduced methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) activity.
