Healthcare provider education to support integration of pharmacogenomics in practice: the eMERGE Network experience.
Ten organizations within the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network developed programs to implement pharmacogenomic sequencing and clinical decision support into clinical settings. Recognizing the importance of informed prescribers, a variety of strategies were used to incorporate provider education to support implementation. Education experiences with pharmacogenomics are described within the context of each organization's prior involvement, including the scope and scale of implementation specific to their Electronic Medical Records and Genomics projects. We describe common and distinct education strategies, provide exemplars and share challenges. Lessons learned inform future perspectives. Future pharmacogenomics clinical implementation initiatives need to include funding toward implementing provider education and evaluating outcomes.
