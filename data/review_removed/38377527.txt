Impact of Pharmacogenomics on Pediatric Psychotropic Medication Prescribing in an Ambulatory Care Setting.
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Evidence for pharmacogenomic (PGx) guided treatment in child and adolescent psychiatry is growing. This study evaluated the impact of PGx testing on psychotropic medication prescribing in an ambulatory child and adolescent psychiatry and a developmental pediatrics clinic. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This was a single-center, retrospective, descriptive analysis of patients who underwent PGx testing between January 2015 and October 2022 at a child and adolescent psychiatry clinic or developmental pediatrics clinic. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with at least one psychotropic medication modification made 6-month posttesting that could be attributed to CYP2C19, CYP2D6, HLA-B*15:02, or HLA-A*31:01. Secondary outcomes included reason for testing, types of therapeutic modifications made, and whether the therapeutic modifications concorded with PGx guidelines. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 193 patients were analyzed. The average age was 10 ± 4 years old, 60% were male, 78% were Caucasian. Sixty-eight percent had a primary diagnosis of a neurodevelopmental disorder, namely autism spectrum disorder (51%), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (14%). The reasons for PGx testing included medication inefficacy (34%), medication intolerance (20%), and family request (19%). At the time of PGx testing, 37% of patients were taking ≥1 psychotropic medication with PGx annotation. Overall, 35 PGx-related therapeutic modifications were made in 32 (17%) patients. These included continuing current PGx medication (6.2%) and starting PGx medication (5.2%). These modifications mainly involved antidepressants. Out of these 35 PGx-related therapeutic modifications, 94% were concordant with PGx guidelines. Among 29 patients who were prescribed at least one CYP2D6 inhibitor, 25 (86%) underwent CYP2D6 phenoconversion. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> It is critical to apply pediatric age-specific considerations when utilizing PGx testing in child and adolescent psychiatry. PGx testing stewardship could provide a framework to guide the clinical utility of PGx in a pediatric population with mental health conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders.
