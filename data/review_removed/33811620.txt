Influence of CYP2C9, VKORC1, and CYP4F2 polymorphisms on the pharmacodynamic parameters of warfarin: a cross-sectional study.
Warfarin is the most commonly evaluated drug in pharmacogenetic-guided dosing studies. However, gaps remain regarding the influence of the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9, VKORC1, and CYP4F2 on specific pharmacodynamic parameters like the warfarin sensitivity index (WSI), prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR), and log-INR variability.
