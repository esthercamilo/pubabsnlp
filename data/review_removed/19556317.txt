Glypican 5 is an interferon-beta response gene: a replication study.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. Interferon-beta is the most usual therapy in relapsing-remiting MS. However, approximately 50% of the treated patients do not respond adequately. Very recently, a genome-wide association study on interferon-beta pharmacogenetics has described polymorphisms at several genes that are associated with response to this treatment. Our aim is to replicate the results obtained at the two loci most strongly implicated in the response to interferon-beta treatment, HAPLN1 and GPC5.
