The Daniel K. Inouye College of Pharmacy Scripts: Precision Medicine Through the Use of Pharmacogenomics: Current Status and Barriers to Implementation.
The precision medicine initiative brought forth by President Barack Obama in 2015 is an important step on the journey to truly personalized medicine. A broad knowledge and understanding of the implications of the pharmacogenomic literature will be critical to the achievement of this goal. While a great amount of data has been published in the areas of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics, there are still relatively few instances in which the need for clinical intervention can be stated without doubt, and which are widely accepted and practiced by the medical community. As our knowledge base rapidly expands, issues such as insurance reimbursement for genetic testing and education of the health care workforce will be paramount to achieving the goal of precision medicine for all patients.
