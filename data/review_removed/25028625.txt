Pharmacogenetics of tacrolimus: ready for clinical translation?
Tacrolimus (Tac) exhibits an interindividual pharmacokinetic variability that affects the dose required to reach the target concentration in blood. Tac is metabolized by two enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family, CYP3A5 and CYP3A4. The effect of the <i>CYP3A</i>5 genotype on Tac bioavailability has been demonstrated, and the main determinant of this pharmacogenetic effect is a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 3 of <i>CYP3A5</i> (6986 A>G; SNP rs776746; also known as <i>CYP3A5*3</i>). The mean dose-adjusted blood Tac concentration was significantly higher among <i>CYP3A5*3</i> homozygotes than that of carriers of the wild-type allele (<i>CYP3A5*1</i>). In a recent prospective study, a group of kidney transplant patients received a Tac dose either according to the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype (the adapted group) or according to the standard regimen (the control group). All patients received induction therapy with mycophenolate mofetil, corticosteroids, and either basiliximab or intravenous anti-thymocyte globulin. Patients in the adapted-dose group required 3-8 days (median 6 days) to reach the target range compared with 3-25 days (median 7 days) in the control group (<i>P</i>=0.001). The total number of dose modifications was also lower in the adapted-dose group. This study also suggested that the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype might contribute minimally to the reduction of early acute rejection. However, additional studies are necessary to determine whether the pharmacogenetic approach could help reduce the necessity for induction therapy and co-immunosuppressors.
