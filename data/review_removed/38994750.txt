Steroid-tacrolimus drug-drug interaction and the effect of CYP3A genotypes.
Tacrolimus, metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes, is susceptible to drug-drug interactions (DDI). Steroids induce CYP3A genes to increase tacrolimus clearance, but the effect is variable. We hypothesized that the extent of the steroid-tacrolimus DDI differs by CYP3A4/5 genotypes.
