[PHARMACOGENOMICS AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE: TOWARDS A SYSTEMATIC GENOMIC SCREENING?].
Recent advances in medical genomics open new perspectives for personalized medicine through the identification of genetic variants that influence drug response and/or the risk of side effects. Today, the clinical applications of pharmacogenetics remain scarce as a consequence of the cost and turn-around-time of genetic tests. However, a few tests are recommended, for instance before the prescription of some anti-cancer agents or the anti-retroviral agent abacavir. In the future, we will probably move either towards rapid targeted tests or towards a large screening, before any diagnosis, of all the genetic factors influencing the therapeutic response. In that case, physicians will have to consult the patient genomic data before drug prescription in order to personalize the choice of the therapeutic agent or its dosage. However, such a genomic approach brings economical and ethical questions and will require further progress in our capacity to interpret and store the personal genomic data without compromising their confidentiality.
