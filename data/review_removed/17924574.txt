GPCR NaVa database: natural variants in human G protein-coupled receptors.
The superfamily of human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is large and regulates a plethora of important physiological processes by transducing extracellular signals over cell membranes. A diversity of natural variants occurs in these receptors, including rare mutations and common polymorphisms. These variants differ in their impact on DNA, ranging from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to copy number variants, and in their impact on protein function. Natural variants furthermore vary in their effects on human phenotypes from neutral to disease-associated. As mutation data are highly dispersed over numerous sources, a single resource for variants would aid investigators of GPCRs. The GPCR NaVa database therefore integrates data on natural variants in human GPCRs from online databases, the scientific literature, and patents. Where available, variants contain information on their location in the DNA (and protein sequence), the involved nucleotides (and amino acids), the average frequency of each allele, reported disease associations, and references to public databases and the scientific literature. The GPCR NaVa database aims to facilitate studies into pharmacogenetics, genotype-phenotype, and structure-function relationships of GPCRs. The GPCR NaVa database is interlinked with the family-specific GPCRDB resource and is accessible as a stand-alone database through a user-friendly website at http://nava.liacs.nl (last accessed 28 August 2007).
