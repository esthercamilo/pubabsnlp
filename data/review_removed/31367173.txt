Diversity in the Era of Precision Medicine - From Bench to Bedside Implementation.
Recent evidence shows how patients' unique genetic makeup can affect disease outcomes and the increasing availability of targeted treatments promises a future in health care, whereby treatments will be tailored to individual needs. This article reports on the topics discussed at the 13th Annual Texas Conference on Health Disparities, organized by the Texas Center for Health Disparities at the University of North Texas Health Science Center; the meeting focused on the theme, "Diversity in the Era of Precision Medicine" and was held during June 2018 in Fort Worth, Texas. The primary focus of this conference, which brought together clinical and basic scientists, was on the inclusion of diversity in precision medicine to bridge the gap in health disparities. Here, we present the highlights of the conference that include the potential application of precision medicine at the population level, the effects of precision medicine and direct-to-consumer testing on health disparities, genetic basis of health disparities, pharmacogenomics, and strategies to enhance participation of under-represented populations in precision medicine. Furthermore, we conclude with recommendations for future implementation, including how to mitigate disparities in genomics services and enhance participation of diverse groups in clinical trials.
