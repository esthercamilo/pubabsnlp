Advances in the diagnosis of drug eruptions.
Drug eruptions affecting the skin or mucosas (toxicoderma) are the most common adverse effects of drugs and represent one of the more common diagnostic challenges for the dermatologist. A better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of drug reactions, pharmacogenetics, and pharmacoepidemiology will help us to resolve the main dilemmas and to anticipate and even prevent such reactions. Many drug eruptions are due to T cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions that can involve activation of different proinflammatory mechanisms, which would explain the varied manifestations. Some aspects defy the classical understanding of antigen processing and presentation. New immunological hypotheses, such as the «p-i concept», have been introduced to complement the hapten theory and, at least in part, help to explain why drug reactions tend to affect the skin and why certain viral infections increase the risk of drug eruptions. In this paper we analyze these pathogenic concepts and the role of HLA genes in the susceptibility to certain severe adverse drug reactions, and also examine other advances in the diagnosis of drug eruptions. We briefly discuss a number of recently described reactions to new drugs.
