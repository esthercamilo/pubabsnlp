<i>ADRB2</i> and <i>ADCY9</i> Sequence Variations in Brazilian Asthmatic Patients.
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory condition, characterized by variable airflow limitation, leading to clinical symptoms such as dyspnea and chest tightness. These symptoms result from an underlying inflammatory process. The Î²2 agonists are bronchodilators prescribed for the relief of the disease. Nevertheless, their efficacy exhibits substantial interindividual variability. Currently, there is widespread recognition of the association between specific genetic variants, predominantly located within the <i>ADRB2</i> and <i>ADCY9</i> genes and their efficacy. This association, usually represented by the presence of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have a strong impact in the protein functionality. The prevalence of these mutations varies based on the ethnic composition of the population and thus understanding the profiles of variability in different populations would contribute significantly to standardizing the use of these medications. In this study, we conducted a sequence-based genotyping of the relevant SNPs within the <i>ADRB2</i> and <i>ADCY9</i> genes in patients undergoing treatment with bronchodilators and/or corticosteroids at two healthcare facilities in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We investigated the presence of c.46A>G, c.79C>G, c.252G>A, and c.491C>T SNPs within the <i>ADRB2</i>, and c.1320018 A>G within the <i>ADCY9</i>. Our results were in line with existing literature data with both for individuals in Brazil and Latin American.
