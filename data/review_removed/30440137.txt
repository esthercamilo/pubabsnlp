[Clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients received capecitabine based adjuvant chemotherapy and the corresponding pharmacogenomics analysis].
<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the association between Thymidine phosphorylase(TYMP)genetic variation and clinical outcomes of postoperative gastric cancer (GC) patients received capecitabine based regimens. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 198 GC patients underwent surgical treatment and received capecitabine based adjuvant chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Peripheral blood and the postoperative tissue specimen of the GC patients were collected for the genotyping of polymorphism and TYMP mRNA expression, respectively. The correlation between polymorphism and clinical outcomes and safety of postoperative GC patients were analysed. <b>Results:</b> Located in the upstream, rs11479 was of clinical significance. The prevalence of rs11479 in TYMP among the GC patients were as follows: CC genotype 125 cases (63.13%), CT genotype 65 cases (32.83%), TT genotype 8 cases (4.04%), minor allele frequency of rs11479 is 0.20. The distribution of three genotypes were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (<i>P</i>=0.901). The analysis results of patients with different genotypes found that the 3-year disease free survival rate of the patients with CT/TT genotype and CC genotype were 73.97% and 65.60%, respectively, which was statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.003). In terms of overall survival, the 3-year overall survival rate of the two genotypes were 83.56% and 72.80% (<i>P</i>=0.012), respectively. Adjusted in multivariate Cox regression analysis, CT/TT genotype was an independent favorable factor for disease free survival (<i>OR</i>=0.55, <i>P</i>=0.011). Safety analysis indicated that there was no significant association between genotypes and grade 2 adverse reaction. Additionally, of the 79 postoperative tissue specimens, the results showed that the expression of TYMP in cancer tissues of the patients with CT/TT genotypes were significantly higher than those of the wild type CC genotype patients (<i>P</i><0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> The polymorphism rs11479 of TYMP have favorable influence on the clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients received capecitabine based adjuvant chemotherapy treatment through changing the mRNA expression of TYMP.
