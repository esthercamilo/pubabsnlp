Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Biologics in Crohn's Disease.
Reactive therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is considered the standard of care for optimizing biologics in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD). Preliminary data show that proactive TDM is associated with positive outcomes in IBD and can be also used to efficiently guide therapeutic decisions in specific clinical scenarios. Higher biological drug concentrations are associated with favorable therapeutic outcomes in specific IBD populations or phenotypes including pediatric CD, perianal fistulizing CD, small bowel CD, and following an ileocolonic resection for CD. Future perspectives of TDM include the use of rapid testing, pharmacogenomics, and pharmacokinetic dashboards toward individualized therapy.
