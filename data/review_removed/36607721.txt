<i>UGT2B7 c.-161C>T</i> polymorphism frequency in Croatian population.
Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase-2B7 (UGT2B7), enzyme responsible for the elimination of a number of xenobiotics through glucuronidation, is expressed in the gut, kidneys, intestines, and brain. However, data on the frequency of <i>UGT2B7</i> polymorphisms in the Croatian population are limited. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of the <i>UGT2B7 c.-161C>T</i> (rs7668258) polymorphism in the Croatian population and to compare it with reported frequencies in other populations. This polymorphism is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the <i>UGT2B7</i> c.<i>802C>T</i> (<i>UGT2B7*2</i>, rs7439366) variant, which is important in clinical medicine. The study reports data of 501 participants from University Hospital Centre Zagreb. All data were collected and analysed retrospectively. Genotyping was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the TaqMan<sub>Â®</sub> Drug Metabolism Genotyping Assay for <i>UGT2B7 c.-161C>T</i> (rs7668258). We found that 120 (23.95 %) participants were carriers of the <i>UGT2B7 c</i>.-<i>161CC</i> genotype and 255 (50.9 %) were heterozygous carriers (<i>UGT2B7 c</i>.-<i>161CT</i>), while 126 (25.15 %) were homozygous carriers of the variant allele (<i>UGT2B7 c</i>.-<i>161TT</i>). The frequency of the variant <i>UGT2B7 c</i>.-<i>161C</i>><i>T</i> allele in this study was T=0.506. The frequency of the <i>UGT2B7 c</i>.-<i>161C>T</i> allelic variants and genotypes in the Croatian population is similar to other European populations.
