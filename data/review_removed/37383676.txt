A Pharmacogenetics-Based Approach to Managing Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: Current Perspectives and Future Steps.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used medications to treat acid-related conditions, including gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Gastroenterology guidelines mention the importance of CYP2C19 in PPI metabolism and the influence of <i>CYP2C19</i> genetic variations on variable responses to PPIs, but do not currently recommend the genotyping of <i>CYP2C19</i> prior to prescribing PPIs. There are strong data to support the influence of <i>CYP2C19</i> genetic variations on the pharmacokinetics of PPIs and clinical outcomes. Existing pharmacogenetic guideline recommendations for dose increases focus on <i>H. pylori</i> and erosive esophagitis indications, but PPIs are also the main therapy for treating GERD. Recent data suggest GERD patients being treated with a PPI may also benefit from genotype-guided dosing. We summarize the literature supporting this contention and highlight future directions for improved management of patients with GERD through precision medicine approaches.
