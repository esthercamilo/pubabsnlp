Influence of Renal Impairment and Genetic Subtypes on Warfarin Control in Japanese Patients.
The genotypes of vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (<i>VKORC1</i>) and cytochrome P450 2C9 (<i>CYP2C9</i>) can influence therapeutic warfarin doses. Conversely, nongenetic factors, especially renal function, are associated with warfarin maintenance doses; however, the optimal algorithm for considering genes and renal dysfunction has not been established. This single-center prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the factors affecting warfarin maintenance doses and develop pharmacogenetics-guided algorithms, including the factors of renal impairment and others. To commence, 176 outpatients who were prescribed warfarin for thromboembolic stroke prophylaxis in the stroke center, were enrolled. Patient characteristics, blood test results, dietary vitamin K intake, and <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>VKORC1 (-1639G>A)</i> genotypes were recorded. <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>VKORC1 (-1639G>A)</i> genotyping revealed that 80% of the patients had <i>CYP2C9 *1/*1</i> and <i>VKORC1</i> mutant AA genotypes. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the optimal pharmacogenetics-based model comprised age, body surface area, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), genotypes, vitamin K intake, aspartate aminotransferase levels, and alcohol intake. eGFR exercised a significant impact on the maintenance doses, as an increase in eGFR of 10 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> escalated the warfarin maintenance dose by 0.6 mg. Reduced eGFR was related to lower warfarin maintenance doses, independent of <i>VKORC1</i> and <i>CYP2C9</i> genotypes in Japanese patients.
