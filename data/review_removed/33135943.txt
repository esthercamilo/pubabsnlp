Compounding for women's health: a compounder's perspective - need, regulations, and future.
Compounding medicine involves various health-care professionals working together to produce medications that treat patient conditions including menopause and other women's health-related illnesses. These medications are compounded under the standards and guidelines mandated by individual state pharmacy boards, the US Food and Drug Administration, and other professional organizations. Contrary to commercial medications, the personalized medicine aspect of compounding medications ensures that the patient's allergies, doses, and drug delivery preferences are addressed during formulation. In the foreseeable future, compounders will continue to formulate medications that are unavailable in the commercial sector, following strict safe-practice guidelines. More importantly, the application of pharmacogenomics and three-dimensional printing to compounding medications could revolutionize compounding formulations and generate new approaches for personalized medicine.
