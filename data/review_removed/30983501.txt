Impact of CYP3A5 phenotype on tacrolimus concentrations after sublingual and oral administration in lung transplant.
<b>Aim:</b> This study evaluated the impact of <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype and other patient characteristics on sublingual (SL) tacrolimus exposure and compared the relationship with oral administration. <b>Patients & methods:</b> Tacrolimus concentrations were retrospectively collected for adult lung transplant recipients, who were genotyped for <i>CYP3A5*3</i>, <i>CYP3A4*22</i>, <i>CYP3A7*1C</i>, and <i>POR*28</i>. Regression analyses were performed to determine covariates that impacted the SL and oral tacrolimus concentration/dose ratios. <b>Results:</b> An interaction of <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype and CYP3A inhibitor increased the SL concentration/dose, while cystic fibrosis decreased the SL concentration/dose. The oral concentration/dose was independently associated with these covariates and was increased by serum creatinine and number of tacrolimus doses. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study suggests personalized dosing strategies for tacrolimus likely need to consider characteristics beyond <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype.
