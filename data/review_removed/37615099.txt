Effects of <i>CYP3A4</i> and <i>CYP2C9</i> genotype on systemic anastrozole and fulvestrant concentrations in SWOG S0226.
<b>Objective & methods:</b> This study tested associations of genotype-predicted activity of CYP3A4, other pharmacogenes, <i>SLC28A7</i> (rs11648166) and <i>ALPPL2</i> (rs28845026) with systemic concentrations of the endocrine therapies anastrozole and fulvestrant in SWOG S0226 trial participants. <b>Results:</b> Participants in the anastrozole-only arm with low CYP3A4 activity (i.e. <i>CYP3A4*22</i> carriers) had higher systemic anastrozole concentrations than patients with high CYP3A4 activity (β-coefficient = 10.03; 95% CI: 1.42, 18.6; p = 0.025). In an exploratory analysis, participants with low CYP2C9 activity had lower anastrozole concentrations and higher fulvestrant concentrations than participants with high CYP2C9 activity. <b>Conclusion:</b> Inherited genetic variation in <i>CYP3A4</i> and <i>CYP2C9</i> may affect concentrations of endocrine therapy and may be useful to personalize dosing and improve treatment outcomes.
