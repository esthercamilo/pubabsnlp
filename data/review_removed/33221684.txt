Establishment and application of a predictive model for gefitinib-induced severe rash based on pharmacometabolomic profiling and polymorphisms of transporters in non-small cell lung cancer.
Rash is a well-known predictor of survival for patients with gefitinib therapy with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, whether patients with more severe rash obtain the more survival benefits from gefitinib is still unknown, and predicted model for severe rash is needed.
