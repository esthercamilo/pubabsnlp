Predictors of Efavirenz Plasma Exposure, Auto-Induction Profile, and Effect of Pharmacogenetic Variations among HIV-Infected Children in Ethiopia: A Prospective Cohort Study.
(1) Background: Efavirenz plasma concentration displays wide between-patient variability partly due to pharmacogenetic variation and autoinduction. Pediatric data on efavirenz pharmacokinetics and the relevance of pharmacogenetic variation are scarce, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa, where >90% of HIV-infected children live and population genetic diversity is extensive. We prospectively investigated the short- and long-term effects of efavirenz auto-induction on plasma drug exposure and the influence of pharmacogenetics among HIV-infected Ethiopian children. (2) Method: Treatment-naïve HIV-infected children aged 3-16 years old (<i>n</i> = 111) were enrolled prospectively to initiate efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Plasma efavirenz concentrations were quantified at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 weeks of cART. Genotyping for <i>CYP2B6, CYP3A5, UGT2B7, ABCB1,</i> and <i>SLCO1B1</i> common functional variant alleles was performed. (3) Results: The efavirenz plasma concentration reached a peak at two months, declined by the 3rd month, and stabilized thereafter, with no significant difference in geometric mean over time. On average, one-fourth of the children had plasma efavirenz concentrations ≥4 µg/mL. On multivariate analysis, <i>CYP2B6*6</i> and <i>ABCB1c.3435 C</i> > <i>T</i> genotypes and low pre-treatment low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were significantly associated with higher plasma efavirenz concentration regardless of treatment duration. Duration of cART, sex, age, nutritional status, weight, and <i>SLCO1B, CYP3A5, UGT2B7,</i> and <i>ABCB</i>1 rs3842 genotypes were not significant predictors of efavirenz plasma exposure. (4) Conclusion: Pre-treatment LDL cholesterol and <i>CYP2B6*6</i> and <i>ABCB1c.3435 C > T</i> genotypes predict efavirenz plasma exposure among HIV-infected children, but treatment-duration-dependent changes in plasma efavirenz exposure due to auto-induction are not statistically significant.
