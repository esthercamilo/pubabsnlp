Genome-wide association studies and epigenome-wide association studies go together in cancer control.
Completion of the human genome a decade ago laid the foundation for: using genetic information in assessing risk to identify individuals and populations that are likely to develop cancer, and designing treatments based on a person's genetic profiling (precision medicine). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) completed during the past few years have identified risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms that can be used as screening tools in epidemiologic studies of a variety of tumor types. This led to the conduct of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). This article discusses the current status, challenges and research opportunities in GWAS and EWAS. Information gained from GWAS and EWAS has potential applications in cancer control and treatment.
