CYP2C19 genotype has prognostic value in specific populations following coronary stenting.
The prognostic value of the CYP2C19 genotype in post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients remains controversial. The recently-published, limited-sample PHARMCLO trial indicates a personalized pharmacogenomic approach may reduce adverse events. This study aimed to determine the prognostic value of CYP2C19 genotypes.
