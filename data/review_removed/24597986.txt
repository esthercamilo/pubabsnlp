Association between reduced folate carrier G80A polymorphism and methotrexate toxicity in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a meta-analysis.
Abstract Methotrexate (MTX) is a key component of chemotherapeutic regimens for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and enters the cell via active transport mediated by the reduced folate carrier (RFC1). A major single-nucleotide polymorphism of the RFC1 gene, G80A, which affects the activity of RFC1, may influence MTX toxicity in pediatric ALL. We collected all studies that investigated the association of RFC1 G80A polymorphism and MTX toxicity in pediatric ALL, and found inconsistency among their results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize all of these studies in order to clarify the correlation between the RFC1 G80A polymorphism and MTX toxicity in pediatric ALL. A recessive model demonstrated no influence of the RFC1 G80A genotype on MTX toxicity. In conclusion, the RFC1 G80A polymorphism does not seem to be a good marker of MTX-related toxicity in pediatric ALL.
