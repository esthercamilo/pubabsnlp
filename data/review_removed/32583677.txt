The effects of <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>VKORC1</i> gene polymorphisms on warfarin maintenance dose in Turkish cardiac patients.
<b>Aim:</b> Our aim was to examine the effect of <i>CYP2C9</i> and <i>VKORC1</i> polymorphisms on warfarin dose requirements in Turkish patients. <b>Materials & methods:</b> 24 warfarin prescribed patients were included and analyzed for eight <i>VKORC1</i> and 6 <i>CYP2C9</i> polymorphisms in the study. <b>Results:</b> Patients with <i>CYP2C9</i> *1/*1 and <i>VKORC1</i> -1639 GG and GA genotypes required higher warfarin doses in comparison to wild type <i>VKORC1</i> genotype. Patients with <i>CYP2C9</i> *1/*3 and <i>VKORC1</i> -1639 GG genotypes simultaneously, required the lowest dose of warfarin (4.64 mg/day). Patients with <i>CYP2C9</i> *1/*1 and <i>VKORC1</i> 9041 AA genotype were found to require higher warfarin doses. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results provide additional evidence to support the hypothesis that <i>CYP2C9</i> *2, *3, <i>VKORC1</i> 9041 G > A polymorphisms explain considerable proportion of inter-individual variability in warfarin dose requirement.
