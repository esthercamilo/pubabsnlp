Vitamin D pathway gene polymorphisms and hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis C-affected patients treated with new drugs.
Since HCV infection may lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and vitamin D (deficiency) is related to cancer, we investigated if SNPs in genes involved in vitamin D pathway could predict HCV-related HCC presence in patients treated with new anti-HCV drugs.
