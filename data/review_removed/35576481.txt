An antiplatelet response gene expression signature is associated with bleeding.
Gene expression biosignatures may hold promise to individualize antiplatelet therapy in conjunction with current guidelines and risk scores. The Aspirin Response Signature (ARS) score is comprised of a weighted sum of correlated, pro-thrombotic gene transcripts measured in whole blood. In prior work where volunteers were exposed to aspirin 325 mg daily, higher ARS score was associated with lower platelet function; separately, in a clinical cohort of patients, higher ARS scores were associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. To better understand this apparent paradox, we measured ARS gene expression and score in volunteers to determine aspirin dose-response and ticagrelor relationships with ARS score and separately in patients to assess whether ARS is associated with incident bleeding.
