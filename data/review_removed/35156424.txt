<i>CYP2C19</i> Genotype-Guided Antiplatelet Therapy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Diverse Clinical Settings.
Background Studies have demonstrated increased risk of major atherothrombotic events in <i>CYP2C19</i> loss-of-function (LOF) variant carriers versus non-carriers treated with clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We sought to evaluate real-world outcomes with the clinical implementation of <i>CYP2C19</i>-guided antiplatelet therapy after PCI. Methods and Results Data from 9 medical centers where genotyping was performed in the setting of PCI were included. Alternative therapy with prasugrel or ticagrelor was recommended for patients with a <i>CYP2C19</i> LOF variant. The primary outcome was the composite of major atherothrombotic events (all-cause death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, stent thrombosis, or hospitalization for unstable angina) within 12 months following PCI. Moderate or severe/life-threatening bleeding within 12 months was a secondary outcome. Among 3342 patients, 1032 (31%) were LOF carriers, of whom 571/1032 (55%) were treated with alternative therapy. In LOF carriers, the rate of major atherothrombotic events was lower in patients treated with alternative therapy versus clopidogrel (adjusted HR, 0.56; 95% CI 0.39-0.82). In those without a LOF allele, no difference was observed (adjusted HR, 1.07; 95% CI 0.71-1.60). There was no difference in bleeding with alternative therapy versus clopidogrel in either LOF carriers or those without a LOF allele. Conclusions Real-world data demonstrate lower atherothrombotic risk in <i>CYP2C19</i> LOF carriers treated with alternative therapy versus clopidogrel and similar risk in those without a LOF allele treated with clopidogrel or alternative therapy. These data suggest that PCI patients treated with clopidogrel should undergo genotyping so that <i>CYP2C19</i> LOF carriers can be identified and treated with alternative therapy.
