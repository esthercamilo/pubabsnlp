Effects of Ketoconazole, a CYP4F2 Inhibitor, and CYP4F2*3 Genetic Polymorphism on Pharmacokinetics of Vitamin K<sub>1</sub>.
The objective of this study was to evaluate whether cytochrome P450 (CYP)4F2 is involved in the exposure of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> through a drug interaction study with ketoconazole, a CYP4F2 inhibitor, and a pharmacogenetic study with CYP4F2*3. Twenty-one participants with different CYP4F2*3 polymorphisms were enrolled (8 for *1/*1, 7 for *1/*3, and 6 for *3/*3). All participants were treated twice daily for 5 days with 200 mg of ketoconazole or placebo. Finally, a single dose of 10 mg vitamin K<sub>1</sub> was administered, plasma levels of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> were measured, and its pharmacokinetics was assessed. Ketoconazole elevated the plasma levels of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> and increased the average area under the concentration-time curve (AUC<sub>inf</sub> ) and peak concentration by 41% and 40%, respectively. CYP4F2*3 polymorphism also affected plasma levels of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> and its pharmacokinetics in a gene dose-dependent manner. The average AUC<sub>inf</sub> value was 659.8 ng·h/mL for CYP4F2*1/*1, 878.1 ng·h/mL for CYP4F2*1/*3, and 1125.2 ng·h/mL for CYP4F2*3/*3 (P = .010). This study revealed that ketoconazole and CYP4F2*3 polymorphism substantially increased the exposure of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> in humans. These findings provide a plausible explanation for variations in warfarin dose requirements resulting from interindividual variations in vitamin K<sub>1</sub> exposure due to CYP4F2-related drug interactions and genetic polymorphisms.
