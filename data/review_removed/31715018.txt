Evaluation of Current Regulation and Guidelines of Pharmacogenomic Drug Labels: Opportunities for Improvements.
Pharmacogenomic drug labels in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) provide an instrument for clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics. We compared pharmacogenomic guidance by Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and by the European agencies the European Medicines Agency (EMA), College ter Beoordeling van Geneesmiddelen Medicines Evaluation Board (CBG-MEB), and Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (FIDMD), collectively assigned as EMA/FIDMD+MEB shortened as EMA/FM. Of 54 drugs with an actionable gene-drug interaction in the CPIC and DPWG guidelines, only 50% had actionable pharmacogenomic information in the SmPCs and the agencies were in agreement in only 18% of the cases. We further compared 450 additional drugs, lacking CPIC or DPWG guidance, and found 126 actionable gene-drug labels by the FDA and/or the EMA/FM. Based on these 126 drugs in addition to the 54 above, the consensus of actionable pharmacogenomic labeling between the FDA and the EMA/FM was only 54%. In conclusion, guidelines provided by CPIC/DPWG are only partly implemented into the SmPCs and the implementation of pharmacogenomic drug labels into the clinics would strongly gain from a higher extent of consensus between agencies.
