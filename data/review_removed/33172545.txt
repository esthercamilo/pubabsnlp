[Pharmacogenomics: precision tool in routine prescription].
Pharmacogenomics is an emerging tool to improve the efficacy and safety of drug treatment through the DNA analysis in the genes related to drug concentrations (pharmacokinetics) and drug actions (pharmacodynamics). Clinicians need to integrate the genomic data in their benefit-risk assessment and then provide the right drug to the right patient at the right time. This tool can help to prevent an ineffective treatment, select right dose and reduce adverse drug reactions that are common in the current practice under the trial-observation-adjustment model. Pharmacogenomics may have extensive impacts on unique paediatric patients to enhance a better relationship between medical professionals and affected children or their guardians and to improve the drug compliance. Clinicians should embrace the advancements in pharmacogenomics and actively participate in clinical research to identify the ancestor-related alleles and develop the population-specific gene panel. It will allow patients to enjoy more achievements in pharmacogenomics by implementing it in first line clinical practice.
