Genetic variability affects absolute and relative potencies and kinetics of the anesthetics isoflurane and sevoflurane in Drosophila melanogaster.
Genetic variability affects the response to numerous xenobiotics but its role in the clinically-observed irregular responses to general anesthetics remains uncertain. To investigate the pharmacogenetics of volatile general anesthetics (VGAs), we developed a Serial Anesthesia Array apparatus to expose multiple Drosophila melanogaster samples to VGAs and behavioral assays to determine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of VGAs. We studied the VGAs isoflurane and sevoflurane in four wild type strains from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, two commonly used laboratory strains (Canton S and w <sup>1118</sup> ), and a mutant in Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ND23 <sup>60114</sup> ). In all seven strains, isoflurane was more potent than sevoflurane, as predicted by their relative lipid solubilities, and emergence from isoflurane was slower than from sevoflurane, reproducing cardinal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in mammals. In addition, ND23 <sup>60114</sup> flies were more sensitive to both agents, as observed in worms, mice, and humans carrying Complex I mutations. Moreover, we found substantial variability among the fly strains both in absolute and in relative pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of isoflurane and sevoflurane. These data indicate that naturally occurring genetic variations measurably influence cardinal pharmacologic properties of VGAs and that flies can be used to identify relevant genetic variations.
