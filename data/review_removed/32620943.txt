Pharmacogenomics for immunotherapy and immune-related cardiotoxicity.
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has become a standard of care in a subset of solid tumors. Although cancer survivorship has extended, rates of durable response of ICB remain poor; furthermore, cardiac adverse effects are emerging, which impact several mechanical aspects of the heart. Cardio-oncology programs implement a clinical assessment to curtail cardiovascular disease progression but are limited to the current clinical parameters used in cardiology. Pharmacogenomics provides the potential to unveil heritable and somatic genetic variations for guiding precision immunotherapy treatment to reduce the risk of immune-related cardiotoxicity. A better understanding of pharmacogenomics will optimize the current treatment selection and dosing of immunotherapy. Here, we summarize the recent pharmacogenomics studies in immunotherapy responsiveness and its related cardiotoxicity and highlight how patient genetics and epigenetics can facilitate researchers and clinicians in designing new approaches for precision immunotherapy. We highlight and discuss how single-cell technologies, human-induced pluripotent stem cells and systems pharmacogenomics accelerate future studies of precision cardio-oncology.
