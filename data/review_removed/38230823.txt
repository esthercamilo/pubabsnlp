Additive effects of TPMT and NUDT15 on thiopurine toxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia across multiethnic populations.
Thiopurines such as mercaptopurine (MP) are widely used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) inactivate thiopurines, and no-function variants are associated with drug-induced myelosuppression. Dose adjustment of MP is strongly recommended in patients with intermediate or complete loss of activity of TPMT and NUDT15. However, the extent of dosage reduction recommended for patients with intermediate activity in both enzymes is currently not clear.
