Combination of germline variations associated with survival of folinic acid, fluorouracil and irinotecan-treated metastatic colorectal cancer patients.
<b>Aim:</b> Germline variants could modify survival of metastatic colorectal cancer patients (mCRC). <b>Patients & methods:</b> The association of 285 haplotype-tagging SNPs in 11 candidate genes and overall survival (OS) was tested in two cohorts totalizing 417 FOLFIRI-treated mCRC. Gene expression was investigated <i>in vitro</i> and in public datasets. <b>Results:</b> In the combined cohort, <i>CES1</i> rs9921399T>C was associated with prolonged OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.40) whereas <i>ABCC1</i> rs17501011G>A (HR = 2.08) and <i>UGT1</i> rs1113193G>A (HR = 2.12) were associated with shorter OS (p ≤ 0.005). A combined effect of these polymorphisms was observed with HR of 1.98-2.97 (p < 0.05). The <i>ABCC1</i> rs17501011A variant reduced reporter-gene activity (p < 0.05) whereas <i>ABCC1</i> tumor expression was associated with shorter survival (p ≤ 0.013). <b>Conclusion:</b> We identified a combination of genetic determinants that could predict mCRC survival.
