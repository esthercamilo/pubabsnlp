Pharmacogenetic research in Kazakhstan.
Pharmacogenomics is an emerging field of medicine that combines genetics and pharmacology. Pharmacogenomic research is relatively new in Kazahkstan, but, in recent years, significant progress has been made in this field. The National Scientific Laboratory for Biotechnology has launched several government-funded research projects focused on finding genetic markers that determine susceptibility to various drugs. Another goal of pharmacogenetic research in the laboratory is to find the pharmacogenomic markers that target cardiovascular diseases, accounting for allelic frequencies in selected genes in the Kazakh population. In addition, pharmacogenomic testing kits allow patients to choose the drug dosage. For example, the drug Warfarin has been developed within the framework of the "Technology Commercialization Project," funded jointly by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the World Bank.
