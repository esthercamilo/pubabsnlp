Pharmacogenetics in drug discovery and development: a translational perspective.
The ability to predict a patient's drug response on the basis of their genetic information is expected to decrease attrition during the development of new, innovative drugs, and reduce adverse events by being able to predict individual patients at risk. Most pharmacogenetic investigations have focused on drug-metabolism genes or candidate genes that are thought to be involved in specific diseases. However, robust new genetic tools now enable researchers to carry out multi-candidate gene-association and genome-wide studies for target discovery and drug development. Despite the expanding role of pharmacogenetics in industry, however, there is a paucity of published data. New forms of effective and efficient collaboration between industry and academia that may enhance the systematic collection of pharmacogenetic data are necessary to establish genetic profiles related to drug response, confirm pharmacogenetic associations and expedite the development of new drugs and diagnostic tests.
