Identification of clinical and pharmacogenetic factors influencing metformin response in Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Metformin, a hypoglycemic drug for Type 2 diabetes mellitus, shows variability in pharmacokinetics and response due to membrane transporters. This study followed 34 Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients on metformin treatment. Genetic variants in 11 metformin transport-related genes were analyzed, revealing associations. Specifically, <i>SLC47A1</i> rs2289669 A/A and <i>SLC22A4</i> rs1050152 T/T genotypes correlated with glycated hemoglobin values at 6 months. <i>SLC47A1</i> rs2289669 G/A genotype influenced glucose levels at 6 months, while <i>SLC29A4</i> rs3889348 A/A, <i>SLC47A1</i> rs2289669 A/A, <i>SLC22A4</i> rs1050152 C/T and <i>SLC47A2</i> rs12943590 A/A genotypes were linked to glucose levels at 12 months. Additionally, <i>ABCB1</i> rs2032582 C/A and <i>ABCG2</i> rs2231137 C/T genotypes impacted cholesterol levels at 12 months. These findings shed light on metformin response determinants, offering insights for further research.
