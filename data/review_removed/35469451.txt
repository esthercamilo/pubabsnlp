Patients' perspectives of a pharmacist-provided clinical pharmacogenomics service.
<b>Aim:</b> To assess the perspectives and experiences of patients who participated in a pharmacist-provided clinical pharmacogenomics (PGx) service. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted individual semistructured interviews with 16 patients who received a pharmacist-provided PGx service. Qualitative data were analyzed to identify pertinent themes. <b>Results:</b> The major themes identified were: heterogeneity of patient PGx experiences and preferences, pharmacists as appropriate providers of PGx services, considerations regarding the use of PGx results in routine healthcare and perceived applications of PGx testing. Theme-derived considerations included the need to establish appropriate pre-genotyping expectations, individualize patient education, facilitate collaboration with patients' providers and sustainably update patients' PGx information over time. <b>Conclusion:</b> Patient-specific perspectives such as these are important to consider when providing clinical PGx services, with intention of optimizing patient experiences.
