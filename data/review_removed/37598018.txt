Pharmaceutical care model in precision medicine in China.
Pharmacy service is to provide individualized pharmaceutical care for patients, which should follow the current evidence-based pharmacy, and constantly verify the evidence and then produce new evidence. In pharmaceutical care, differences are often found in the efficacy and adverse reactions of drugs among individuals, even within individuals, which are closely related to patients' genetics, liver and kidney functions, disease states, and drug interactions. Back in the 1980s, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been applied to routinely monitor the blood drug concentration of patients taking antiepileptic drugs or immunosuppressants after transplantation to provide individualized dosage recommendations and accumulate a large amount of pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) data. As individualized pharmaceutical care proceeds, the concept of precision medicine was introduced into pharmacy services in combination with evidence-based pharmacy, PK/PD theories, and big data to further promote the TDM technology and drugs, and carry out pharmacogenomics analysis. The TDM and pharmacogenomics have been applied gradually to the fields of antimicrobial, antitumor, and antipsychotic drugs and immunosuppressants. Based on the concept of precision pharmacy, we adopted approaches including PK/PD, quantitative pharmacology, population pharmacokinetics, and big data machine learning to provide more personalized pharmacy services, which is mainly for special patients, such as critical patients, patients with interaction risk of multiple drugs, patients with liver and renal insufficiency, pregnant women, children, and elderly patients. As the service pattern of precision pharmacy has been constructed and constantly improved, better evidence in clinical practice will be produced to provide patients with better precision pharmacy service.
