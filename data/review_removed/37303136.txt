Toward Integration of Pharmacogenomic Tests into Daily Clinical Practice: A General Survey for Polish Healthcare Workers.
BACKGROUND Pharmacogenomics (PGx) has a direct influence on personalized drug therapy for various types of disorders and has been proven to have an important role in the future of medicine. The present study evaluated the awareness of PGx testing of clinicians and healthcare workers in the Republic of Poland. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct assessment of Polish healthcare professionals' attitudes toward introducing PGx tests into daily clinical practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS We used a comprehensive anonymous questionnaire with queries on level of education, background knowledge of PGx tests, advantages and barriers for implementation of such tests, and clinicians' desire to order the test that was distributed online to doctors, healthcare workers, related students/Ph.D. students, and administrative staff managing healthcare units. RESULTS We gathered 315 responses. According to the answers, two-thirds of participants had heard about PGx before (64.4%). An overwhelming majority of respondents appreciated the benefits of PGx (93.3%). Indeed, prior knowledge and level of education showed significant associations with positive attitudes toward PGx clinical testing (Pâ‰¤0.05). However, all participants agreed there are major challenges for including such tests as part of routine clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS While the awareness and interest in PGx clinical testing in Polish healthcare providers are rising, some main barriers for implementation of these tests still need to be addressed in Poland.
