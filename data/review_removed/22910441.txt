Implementing personalized medicine: development of a cost-effective customized pharmacogenetics genotyping array.
Although there is increasing evidence to support the implementation of pharmacogenetics in certain clinical scenarios, the adoption of this approach has been limited. The advent of preemptive and inexpensive testing of critical pharmacogenetic variants may overcome barriers to adoption. We describe the design of a customized array built for the personalized-medicine programs of the University of Florida and Stanford University. We selected key variants for the array using the clinical annotations of the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB), and we included variants in drug metabolism and transporter genes along with other pharmacogenetically important variants.
