Pharmacogenomics testing in patients with liver transplant and potential impact on prospective management.
<b>Aim:</b> Pharmacogenomics (PGx) tests are performed on whole-blood or saliva specimens. In patients with a transplanted liver, PGx results may be discordant with hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme activity. We evaluate the incidence and impact of PGx testing in liver transplant recipients, detail potential errors and describe clinical decision support (CDS) solution implemented. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A retrospective cohort study of liver transplant recipients at Mayo Clinic who underwent PGx testing between 1 January 1996 and 7 October 2019 were characterized. Impact of a CDS solution was evaluated. <b>Results:</b> There were 129 PGx tests in 117 patients. PGx testing incidence increased before (per year incidence rate ratio = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.20-1.74, p < 0.001) and after transplant (incidence rate ratio = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.27-1.72, p < 0.001). Three erroneous PGx tests were avoided 6 months following CDS implementation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Incidence of PGx testing in liver transplant recipients is increasing, leading to erroneous therapeutic decisions. CDS interventions and education are needed to prevent errors.
