[Cytochrome pharmacogenetics applied to the prescription of antidepressants: Instructions for use].
CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms affect the exposure, efficacy, and safety of antidepressants. This article is an instruction manual and a guide for the deployment, in hospitals, of pharmacogenetics as an aid to the prescription of an antidepressant. It synthesizes the recommendations of two learned societies, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG), to produce a recommendation table adapted to a wide panel of antidepressants.
