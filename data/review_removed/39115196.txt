Update on the PriME-PGx initiative: evolution of pharmacogenetics in daily clinical practice.
In 2021, the Clinical Pharmacology Department of Hospital Universitario de La Princesa launched the PriME-PGx initiative (Multidisciplinary Initiative of the Hospital Universitario de La Princesa for the Implementation of Pharmacogenetics) to promote the expansion of pharmacogenetics in hospitalized patients. We establish seven pharmacogenetic profiles based on the specific needs of seven departments: Oncology, Pain Unit, Neuropsychiatry, Internal or Infectious Medicine, Cardiology, Gastroenterology and Immunosuppressants. The experience of the last 3 yearsÂ reflects a total of 1421 reports (37.4% being oncology profiles), with a gradual increase in the number of requests each year. With this project, we aim to expand the availability and utility of pharmacogenetic biomarkers to achieve personalised therapy that avoids adverse drug reactions and therapeutic failure.
