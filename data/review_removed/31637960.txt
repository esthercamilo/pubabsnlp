The future of pharmacogenetics in the treatment of migraine.
Migraine is considered one of the most disabling neurological disorder with a high socioeconomic burden. Pharmacological management includes many classes of drugs which in the most cases, are administrated in polytherapy. The therapeutic scheme of migraineurs is often affected by comorbidities which need concomitant medications, thus increasing the risk of side effects related to drug-drug interactions. Pharmacogenetics is a promising tool to achieve a personalized cure based on individual genetic profile while the availability of free online knowledge bases allows to check the potential DDIs of selected medications. Combining, these approaches may offer to clinicians a useful tool to improve the appropriateness of migraine polytherapy choice, aiming to increase the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of pharmacological treatments.
