Pharmacotherapy and pregnancy: highlights from the Second International Conference for Individualized Pharmacotherapy in Pregnancy.
To address provider struggles to provide evidence-based, rational drug therapy to pregnant women, a second conference was convened to highlight the current research in the field. Speakers from academic centers and institutions spoke about: the unique physiology and pathology of pregnancy; pharmacokinetic changes in pregnancy; thyroid disorders in pregnancy; pharmacogenetics in pregnancy; the role of CYP2D6 in pregnancy; treating addiction in pregnancy; the power of teratology networks to inform clinical decisions; the use of anti-depressants in pregnancy; and how to utilize computer-based modeling to aid with individualized pharmacotherapy in pregnancy. The Conference highlighted several areas of collaboration with the current Obstetrics Pharmacology Research Units Network (OPRU) and hoped to stimulate further collaboration and knowledge in the area with the common goal to improve the ability to safely and effectively use individualized pharmacotherapy in pregnancy.
