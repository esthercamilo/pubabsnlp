[Pharmacogenetics of timolol].
In recent years, β-adrenergic blockers have become the first choice drugs for glaucoma treatment. Timolol holds the main position among them, being a part of most combined antiglaucoma preparations. The use of timolol maleate in clinical practice may be accompanied by severe side effects affecting different organs and systems. The fact that cells with β-adrenergic receptors are widely common within the human body explains pharmacodynamic effects of timolol maleate. Because of these undesirable side effects, timolol maleate often evokes negative reaction from doctors and patients, which to certain extent limits its usage in ophthalmological practice. Obviously, efficacy and safety of timolol administration depends on individual characteristics making personalized approach necessary for every patient. Such particular approach, being the foundation of personalized medicine, increases efficacy and safety of timolol while reducing costs by using targeted doses.
