The impact of genetics on the management of patients on warfarin awaiting surgery.
Two older patients with atrial fibrillation, receiving warfarin for thromboembolic prophylaxis, with a target range of 2.0-3.0, were significantly over anticoagulated prior to elective intervention, in spite of having adhered to the standard protocol of 5 days of warfarin interruption. Neither patient had any abnormality of liver function nor was taking any interacting drug known to inhibit warfarin metabolism or affect sensitivity to warfarin. Both had variant cytochrome P2C9 (CYP2C9) alleles which reduce the metabolic capacity of the CYP2C9 enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the S-warfarin enantiomer. Need for preoperative administration of vitamin K or postponement of an operation because of an INR >1.5 could be explained by variant alleles for CYP2C9 and age.
