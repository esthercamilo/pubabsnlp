Genetic and Phenotypic Factors Affecting Glycemic Response to Metformin Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic agent widely used in clinical practice for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The wide interindividual variability of response to metformin therapy was shown, and recently the impact of several genetic variants was reported. To assess the independent and combined effect of the genetic polymorphism on glycemic response to metformin, we performed an association analysis of the variants in <i>ATM</i>, <i>SLC22A1</i>, <i>SLC47A1</i>, and <i>SLC2A2</i> genes with metformin response in 299 patients with T2DM. Likewise, the distribution of allele and genotype frequencies of the studied gene variants was analyzed in an extended group of patients with T2DM (<i>n</i> = 464) and a population group (<i>n</i> = 129). According to our results, one variant, rs12208357 in the <i>SLC22A1</i> gene, had a significant impact on response to metformin in T2DM patients. Carriers of <i>TT</i> genotype and <i>T</i> allele had a lower response to metformin compared to carriers of <i>CC</i>/<i>CT</i> genotypes and <i>C</i> allele (<i>p</i>-value = 0.0246, <i>p</i>-value = 0.0059, respectively). To identify the parameters that had the greatest importance for the prediction of the therapy response to metformin, we next built a set of machine learning models, based on the various combinations of genetic and phenotypic characteristics. The model based on a set of four parameters, including gender, rs12208357 genotype, familial T2DM background, and waist-hip ratio (WHR) showed the highest prediction accuracy for the response to metformin therapy in patients with T2DM (AUC = 0.62 in cross-validation). Further pharmacogenetic studies may aid in the discovery of the fundamental mechanisms of type 2 diabetes, the identification of new drug targets, and finally, it could advance the development of personalized treatment.
