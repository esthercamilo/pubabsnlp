Racial differences in advanced colorectal cancer outcomes and pharmacogenetics: a subgroup analysis of a large randomized clinical trial.

A subgroup analysis of a multisite National Cancer Institute-sponsored trial (N9741) was performed comparing outcomes of black and white patients with metastatic CRC receiving uniform treatment.
