Role of chemical structures and the 1331T>C bile salt export pump polymorphism in idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury.
Several pharmaceutical compounds have been shown to exert inhibitory effects on the bile salt export pump (BSEP) encoded by the ABCB11 gene. We analysed the combined effect on drug-induced liver injury (DILI) development of the ABCB11 1331T>C polymorphism and the presence of specific chemical moieties, with known BSEP inhibiting properties, in the causative drug.
