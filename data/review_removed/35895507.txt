Interaction study of salvianolic acids for injection on pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel in rats using LC-MS/MS.
Salvianolic acids for injection (SAI) is developed from traditional Chinese medicine and approved for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, which is often prescribed for patients in combination with SAI. This present study aimed to assess the effects of SAI on the pharmacogenomics, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of clopidogrel, thereby ensuring the safety and efficacy of coadministration. In vitro cytochrome P450 isoenzyme assays were performed in human liver microsomes using LC-MS/MS method to assess the metabolites of CYPs substrates. The effects of SAI on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviors of clopidogrel were investigated in rats. The main pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed using LC-MS/MS. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, and inhibition of platelet aggregation were measured to evaluate the effects of pharmacodynamics. Our study revealed that the clinical dose of SAI has no significant inhibitory effect on clopidogrel-related liver microsome metabolic CYP450 isoenzymes. Moreover, SAI did not affect the pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel when rats were administered both single and multiple doses. In pharmacodynamic study, SAI has no effect on platelet aggregation rate, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time of clopidogrel but could significantly prevent the risk of bleeding caused by clopidogrel.
