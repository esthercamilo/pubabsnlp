Pharmacogenetics and Treatment Response in Narcolepsy Type 1: Relevance of the Polymorphisms of the Drug Transporter Gene ABCB1.
Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is a chronic hypersomnia clinically characterized by daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. Narcolepsy type 1 treatments target individual symptoms: wake-promoting agents (eg, modafinil) are effective for sleepiness, antidepressants (eg, venlafaxine) on cataplexy, whereas sodium oxybate on both. Narcolepsy type 1 patients variably respond to modafinil and venlafaxine independently of individual clinical features.Given the potential influence of drug transmembrane transport (glycoprotein-P) on drug response, we explored the relation between genetic polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene and clinical response to modafinil/venlafaxine in NT1.
