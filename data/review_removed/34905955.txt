Pharmacogenetic loci for rosuvastatin are associated with intima-media thickness change and coronary artery disease risk.
<b>Aim:</b> Polymorphisms at <i>LPA</i>, <i>LDLR</i>, <i>APOE</i>, <i>APOC1</i>, <i>MYLIP</i> and <i>ABCG2</i> are attractive targets for assessment of their impact on lipid-lowering therapy with rosuvastatin. The present study investigated whether polymorphisms at these genes are associated with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) development, and reduction of atherogenic lipids and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) in CAD patients, taking rosuvastatin. <b>Materials & methods:</b> 190 CAD patients and 1697 subjects were enrolled in pharmacogenetic and genetic association study, respectively. SNP genotyping was done using the MassARRAY-4 system. <b>Results:</b><i>MYLIP</i> rs6924995, rs3757354, <i>APOC1</i> rs445925, <i>LDLR</i> rs6511720, <i>APOE</i> rs7412, <i>ABCG2</i> rs2199936, rs1481012 variants were significantly associated with CAD susceptibility (p = 0.016, 0.0003, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.013, 0.016, 0.0035, respectively), as well as with CIMT regression (except <i>ABCG2</i> variants; p = 0.05, 0.039, 0.039, 0.016, 0.0065), and changes in plasma lipids during rosuvastatin therapy. <b>Conclusion:</b> The studied polymorphisms possess pleiotropic effects on plasma lipids and CIMT, CAD susceptibility, and determine lipid-lowering response to rosuvastatin.
