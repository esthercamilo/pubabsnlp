Pharmacogenomics of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.
Cisplatin ototoxicity affects different individuals in a widely variable manner. These variations are likely to be explained by genetic differences among those affected. It would be highly advantageous to identify genetic variants that predispose to cisplatin ototoxicity in order to minimize the risk to susceptible subgroups. Although this area of research is very important, only a few studies have rigorously examined the genetic basis for cisplatin-induced susceptibility to hearing loss. This article addresses recent progress in clarifying the incidence of cisplatin ototoxicity and the risk factors and controversies regarding the identification of genetic variants associated with cisplatin-induced hearing loss.
