An Exploratory Application of Multilayer Networks and Pathway Analysis in Pharmacogenomics.
Over the years, network analysis has become a promising strategy for analysing complex system, i.e., systems composed of a large number of interacting elements. In particular, multilayer networks have emerged as a powerful framework for modelling and analysing complex systems with multiple types of interactions. Network analysis can be applied to pharmacogenomics to gain insights into the interactions between genes, drugs, and diseases. By integrating network analysis techniques with pharmacogenomic data, the goal consists of uncovering complex relationships and identifying key genes to use in pathway enrichment analysis to figure out biological pathways involved in drug response and adverse reactions. In this study, we modelled omics, disease, and drug data together through multilayer network representation. Then, we mined the multilayer network with a community detection algorithm to obtain the top communities. After that, we used the identified list of genes from the communities to perform pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) to figure out the biological function affected by the selected genes. The results show that the genes forming the top community have multiple roles through different pathways.
