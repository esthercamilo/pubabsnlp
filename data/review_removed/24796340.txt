Association of cyclooxygenase-2 genetic variant with cardiovascular disease.
A genetic variant (rs20417) of the PTGS2 gene, encoding for COX-2, has been associated with decreased COX-2 activity and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, this genetic association and the role of COX-2 in CVD remain controversial.
