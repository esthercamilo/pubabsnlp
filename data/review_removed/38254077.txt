A consideration of CYP2D6 genetic variations in the Ghanaian population as a potential 'culprit' for the tramadol 'abuse crisis'.
Cytochrome P450 2D6 is involved in the metabolism of several important medicines including opioids. Variations in CYP2D6 have been implicated in drug response and according to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium Guideline (CPIC) for CYP2D6, dosing for CYP2D6 substrates should be based on variants carried by individuals. Although CYP2D6 variations in Ghana had been previously recorded, not all variants have been reported in the Ghanaian population. In this exploratory study we set to investigate certain unreported variations in the Ghanaian population in addition to the previously reported ones and use that to understand the tramadol 'abuse' crisis that is currently being experienced in Ghana.
