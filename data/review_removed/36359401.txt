Individualization of Mycophenolic Acid Therapy through Pharmacogenetic, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Testing.
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a widely used immunosuppressive agent and exerts its effect by inhibiting inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the main regulating enzyme of purine metabolism. However, significant unexplained differences in the efficacy and tolerability of MPA therapy pose a clinical challenge. Therefore, broad pharmacogenetic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic approaches are needed to individualize MPA therapy. In this prospective cohort study including 277 renal transplant recipients, IMPDH2 rs11706052 SNP status was assessed by genetic sequencing, and plasma MPA trough levels were determined by HPLC and IMPDH enzyme activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Among the 277 patients, 84 were identified with episodes of biopsy-proven rejection (BPR). No association was found between rs11706052 SNP status and graft rejection (OR 1.808, and 95% CI, 0.939 to 3.479; <i>p</i> = 0.076). Furthermore, there was no association between MPA plasma levels and BPR (<i>p</i> = 0.69). However, the patients with graft rejection had a significantly higher predose IMPDH activity in PBMCs compared to the controls without rejection at the time of biopsy (110.1 ± 50.2 vs. 95.2 ± 45.4 pmol/h; <i>p</i> = 0.001), and relative to the baseline IMPDH activity before transplantation (<i>p</i> = 0.042). Our results suggest that individualization of MPA therapy, particularly through pharmacodynamic monitoring of IMPDH activity in PBMCs, has the potential to improve the clinical outcomes of transplant patients.
