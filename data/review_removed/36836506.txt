Pharmacokinetics of Tamoxifen and Its Major Metabolites and the Effect of the African Ancestry Specific CYP2D6*17 Variant on the Formation of the Active Metabolite, Endoxifen.
Tamoxifen (TAM) is widely used in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. TAM is metabolized into the active secondary metabolite endoxifen (ENDO), primarily by CYP2D6. We aimed to investigate the effects of an African-specific <i>CYP2D6</i> variant allele, <i>CYP2D6*</i>17, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAM and its active metabolites in 42 healthy black Zimbabweans. Subjects were grouped based on <i>CYP2D6</i> genotypes as CYP2D6*1/*1 or *1/*2 or *2/*2 (CYP2D6*1 or *2), CYP2D6*1/*17 or 2*/*17, and CYP2D6*17/*17. PK parameters for TAM and three metabolites were determined. The pharmacokinetics of ENDO showed statistically significant differences among the three groups. The mean ENDO AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> in <i>CYP2D6*17/*17</i> subjects was 452.01 (196.94) h·*ng/mL, and the AUC0-∞ in <i>CYP2D6*1/*17</i> subjects was 889.74 h·ng/mL, which was 5-fold and 2.8-fold lower than in CYP2D6*1 or *2 subjects, respectively. Individuals who were heterozygous or homozygous for <i>CYP2D6*17</i> alleles showed a 2- and 5-fold decrease in Cmax, respectively, compared to the <i>CYP2D6*1 or *2</i> genotype. <i>CYP2D6*17</i> gene carriers have significantly lower ENDO exposure levels than <i>CYP2D6*1 or *2</i> gene carriers. Pharmacokinetic parameters of TAM and the two primary metabolites, N-desmethyl tamoxifen (NDT) and 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4OHT), did not show any significant difference in the three genotype groups. The African-specific <i>CYP2D6*17</i> variant had effects on ENDO exposure levels that could potentially have clinical implications for patients homozygous for this variant.
