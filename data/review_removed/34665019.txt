Pharmacogenetics of sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia in Type 2 diabetes patients: the SUCLINGEN study.
<b>Aim:</b> This study investigated the incidence of sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia and its predictors in Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. <b>Patients & methods:</b> In this prospective, observational study, T2D patients on maximal sulfonylurea-metformin therapy >1 year were enrolled. Hypoglycemia was defined as having symptoms or a blood glucose level <3.9 mmol/l. <b>Results:</b> Of the 401 patients, 120 (29.9%) developed sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia during the 12-month follow-up. The <i>ABCC8</i> rs757110, <i>KCNJ11</i> rs5219, <i>CDKAL1</i> rs7756992 and <i>KCNQ1</i> rs2237892 gene polymorphisms were not associated with sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia (p > 0.05). Prior history of hypoglycemia admission (odds ratio = 16.44; 95% CI: 1.74-154.33, p = 0.014) independently predicted its risk. <b>Conclusion:</b> Sulfonylurea-treated T2D patients who experienced severe hypoglycemia are at increased risk of future hypoglycemia episodes.
