Genomics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge, Attitude and Practice of Pharmacists Working in United Arab Emirates: Findings from Focus Group Discussions-A Qualitative Study.
(1) Background: Genomics and pharmacogenomics are relatively new fields in medicine in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Understanding the knowledge, attitudes and current practices among pharmacists is an important pillar to establish the roadmap for implementing genomic medicine and pharmacogenomics; (2) Methods: A qualitative method was used, with focus group discussions (FGDs) being conducted among pharmacists working in public and private hospitals in Abu Dhabi Emirate. Snowball sampling was used. Thematic inductive analysis was performed by two researchers independently. NVIVO software was used to establish the themes; (3) Results: Lack of knowledge of genomics and pharmacogenomics among pharmacists was one of the most prominent findings. Therefore, the role of pharmacist in making the right decisions was highlighted to be a barrier for pharmacogenomics implementation in the UAE. Pharmacists have a positive attitude toward pharmacogenomics, but they are preoccupied with concern of confidentiality. In addition, religion and culture shadowed their attitudes toward genetic testing; (4) Conclusions: It is highly recommended to introduce new courses and training workshops for healthcare providers to improve the opportunities for genomics and pharmacogenomics application in the UAE. Pharmacists agreed that the health authorities should take the lead for improving trust and confidence in the system for a better future in the era of genomics and pharmacogenomics.
