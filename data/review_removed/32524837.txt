Measuring preferences for <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping in patients with acute coronary syndrome - a discrete choice experiment.
<b>Aim:</b> To evaluate the relative importance of <i>CYP2C19</i> genotype-guided treatment attributes to patients. <b>Patients & methods:</b> A discrete choice experiment questionnaire was administered to 63 patients with acute coronary syndrome. Attributes examined in the discrete choice experiment questionnaire were: cost of genetic testing (S$50, S$100, S$200); cost of antiplatelet medication (S$100, S$500, S$1000); heart attack or stroke risk (5 in 100, 15 in 100, 25 in 100); bleeding risk (5 in 100, 15 in 100, 25 in 100); doctor's recommendation (yes, neutral). Mixed logit model was used for analysis. <b>Results & conclusion:</b> All attributes were important in patients' decision-making. Most displayed strong preference for doctor's recommendation and reduced heart attack or stroke risk. Genotyping was chosen by 63.5% of the patients.
