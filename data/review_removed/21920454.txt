Pharmacogenomics: a new clinical or regulatory paradigm? European experiences of pharmacogenomics in drug regulation and regulatory initiatives.
Are regulatory agencies and processes up to speed? This is an often asked question. Recent advances in science and the improved knowledge of the human genome have a considerable influence on drug development and their impact on the regulatory aspect is also significant for several reasons, including changing stakeholder expectations and treatment paradigms. One of the challenges faced by the regulators is the need to adapt regulatory processes to accommodate the newer methodologies and techniques while ensuring that the biomarkers, tests and/or diagnostics, and the clinical trials are appropriate and fit for purpose. The change in emphasis in pharmacological treatment from a phenotype-based approach to newer methods is attractive but is it ready for universal adoption? This paper details some of the regulatory responses to the developments in this area.
