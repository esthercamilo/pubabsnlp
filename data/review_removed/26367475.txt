Differential Consequences of Tramadol in Overdosing: Dilemma of a Polymorphic Cytochrome P450 2D6-Mediated Substrate.
Tramadol is a centrally acting opioid analgesic that is prone to polymorphic metabolism via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. The generation of the active metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol, which occurs through the CYP 2D6 pathway, significantly contributes to the drug's activity. However, dosage adjustments of tramadol are typically not practiced in the clinic when treating patients who are homozygous extensive metabolizers, heterozygous extensive metabolizers, or poor metabolizers. In the event of a tramadol overdose, the consequences may be influenced importantly by the genotype or phenotype status of the subject. Depending on the individual subject's CYP 2D6 status, one may see excessive miotic-related toxicity driven by the excessive availability of O-desmethyltramadol or one may manifest mydriatic-related toxicity driven by the excessive availability of tramadol. This report provides pharmacokinetic perspectives in situations of tramadol overdosing.
