High-Dose Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> during Tuberculosis Treatment in Mongolia. A Randomized Controlled Trial.
Existing trials of adjunctive vitamin D in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are variously limited by small sample sizes, inadequate dosing regimens, and high baseline vitamin D status among participants. Comprehensive analyses of the effects of genetic variation in the vitamin D pathway on response to vitamin D supplementation are lacking.
