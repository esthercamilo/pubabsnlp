Genetic predisposition in type 2 diabetes: A promising approach toward a personalized management of diabetes.
Diabetes mellitus, also known simply as diabetes, has been described as a chronic and complex endocrine metabolic disorder that is a leading cause of death across the globe. It is considered a key public health problem worldwide and one of four important non-communicable diseases prioritized for intervention through world health campaigns by various international foundations. Among its four categories, Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the commonest form of diabetes accounting for over 90% of worldwide cases. Unlike monogenic inherited disorders that are passed on in a simple pattern, T2D is a multifactorial disease with a complex etiology, where a mixture of genetic and environmental factors are strong candidates for the development of the clinical condition and pathology. The genetic factors are believed to be key predisposing determinants in individual susceptibility to T2D. Therefore, identifying the predisposing genetic variants could be a crucial step in T2D management as it may ameliorate the clinical condition and preclude complications. Through an understanding the unique genetic and environmental factors that influence the development of this chronic disease individuals can benefit from personalized approaches to treatment. We searched the literature published in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus and ISI Web of Science for the current status of T2D and its associated genetic risk variants and discus promising approaches toward a personalized management of this chronic, non-communicable disorder.
