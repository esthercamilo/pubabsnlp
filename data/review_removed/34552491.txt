Research Progress of Pharmacogenomics in Drug-Induced Liver Injury.
<b>Background:</b> Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a common and serious adverse drug reaction with insufficient clinical diagnostic strategies and treatment methods. The only clinically well-received method is the Roussel UCLAF Causality Assessment Method scale, which can be applied to both individuals and prospective or retrospective studies. However, in severe cases, patients with DILI still would develop acute liver failure or even death. Pharmacogenomics, a powerful tool to achieve precision medicine, has been used to study the polymorphism of DILI related genes. <b>Summary:</b> We summarized the pathogenesis of DILI and findings on associated genes and variations with DILI, including but not limited to HLA genes, drug metabolizing enzymes, and transporters genes, and pointed out further fields for DILI related pharmacogenomics study to provide references for DILI clinical diagnosis and treatment. <b>Key Messages:</b> At present, most of the studies are mainly limited to CGS and GWAS, and there is still a long way to achieve clinical transformation. DNA methylation could be a new consideration, and ethnic differences and special populations also deserve attention.
