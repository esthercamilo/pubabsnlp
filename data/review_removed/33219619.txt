Factor VIII pharmacokinetics associates with genetic modifiers of VWF and FVIII clearance in an adult hemophilia A population.
Factor VIII (FVIII) pharmacokinetics (PK) in adult hemophilia A populations are highly variable and have been previously determined to be influenced by von Willebrand factor:antigen (VWF:Ag), ABO blood group, and age. However, additional genetic determinants of FVIII PK are largely unknown.
