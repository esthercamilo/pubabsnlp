Responses of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis to methotrexate: a genomic outlook.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic disease characterized by persistent joint inflammation. JIA is the most common pediatric chronic rheumatic disease and no curative therapy is currently available. Methotrexate (MTX) is an important treatment for JIA even though a high inter-individual variability in response is observed in patients. Among the factors of this variability, genetics and epigenetics might play an important role.
