Pharmacogenomics study in a Taiwan methadone maintenance cohort.
Pharmacogenomics is research to study the drug treatment responses in subgroups of patients according to their genetic variants or genetic expression information. Methadone maintenance treatment, which is usually prescribed for patients with heroin dependence, was launched in Taiwan by the government in 2006. In this study, 366 patients who had taken methadone continually in the previous 7 days were examined. Data from administration of the Treatment Outcomes Profile (TOP), Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS), Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS), and Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS) were obtained from patients' report records. Genes encoding the liver cytochrome P-450 (CYP) enzymes that are involved with the metabolism of methadone (CYP2B6, 3A4 and 2C19) were selected and genotyped in this cohort. We found that the SNPs on <i>CYP2B6</i> were associated with plasma <i>S</i>-methadone concentration; SNPs on <i>CYP3A4</i> were associated with withdrawal symptoms and side effects; and SNPs on <i>CYP2C19</i> were associated with methadone dose. SNPs in the genes encoding the morphine phase II metabolic enzyme, <i>UGT2B7</i>, were associated with withdrawal symptom scores. In pharmacodynamic genes, the SNPs on <i>OPRM1</i> were associated with insomnia and change in libido side effects. We conclude that SNP markers may be useful for future methadone dosage adjustment and to reduce adverse reactions.
