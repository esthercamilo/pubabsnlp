Risk Factors of Renal Tubular Dysfunction in Thai People Living with HIV Receiving Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate.
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) associates with renal tubular dysfunction (RTD) in some people living with HIV (PLWH). We studied clinical and genetic factors associated with RTD in Thai PLWH receiving TDF. RTD was diagnosed in 13 of 65 (20%) patients. The median (interquartile range) age and CD4 cell counts were 43.8 (40.4-50.9) years and 554 (437-716) cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The median duration of TDF use was 46.9 (31.5-54.1) months. Univariate logistic regression demonstrated body mass index (BMI), concomitant use of protease inhibitor (PI), hyperlipidemia, and homozygous C/C SNP rs1059751 of <i>ABCC4</i> gene as predisposing factors of RTD. In multivariate model, concomitant use of PI [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 11.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.59- 81.56; <i>P</i> = 0.015], hyperlipidemia (aOR 8.59; 95% CI, 1.46-50.40; <i>P</i> = 0.017), and BMI (aOR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.98; <i>P</i> = 0.037) remained associated with RTD in patients receiving TDF. PLWH receiving TDF with the presence of these factors should be closely monitored for RTD.
