Response to fluoxetine in children and adolescents: a weighted gene co-expression network analysis of peripheral blood.
The inconclusive and non-replicated results of pharmacogenetic studies of antidepressant response could be related to the lack of acknowledgement of its mechanism of action. In this scenario, gene expression studies provide and interesting framework to reveal new candidate genes for pharmacogenetic studies or peripheral biomarkers of fluoxetine response. We propose a system biology approach to analyse changes in gene expression induced by eight weeks of treatment with fluoxetine in peripheral blood. 21 na√Øve child and adolescents participated in the present study. Our analysis include the identification of gene co-expression modules, using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), followed by protein-protein interaction (PPi) network construction coupled with functional annotation. Our results revealed two modules of co-expression genes related to fluoxetine treatment. The constructed networks from these modules were enriched for biological processes related to cellular and metabolic processes, cell communication, immune system processes, cell death, response to stimulus and neurogenesis. Some of these processes, such as immune system, replicated previous findings in the literature, whereas, neurogenesis, a mechanism proposed to be involved in fluoxetine response, had been identified for first time using peripheral tissues. In conclusion, our study identifies several biological processes in relation to fluoxetine treatment in peripheral blood, offer new candidate genes for pharmacogenetic studies and valuable markers for peripheral moderator biomarkers discovery.
