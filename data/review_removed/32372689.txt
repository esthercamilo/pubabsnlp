Differences in telomere length between patients with bipolar disorder and controls are influenced by lithium treatment.
<b>Aim:</b> To assess the role of lithium treatment in the relationship between bipolar disorder (BD) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL). <b>Materials & methods:</b> We compared LTL between 131 patients with BD, with or without a history of lithium treatment, and 336 controls. We tested the association between genetically determined LTL and BD in two large genome-wide association datasets. <b>Results:</b> Patients with BD with a history lithium treatment showed longer LTL compared with never-treated patients (p = 0.015), and similar LTL compared with controls. Patients never treated with lithium showed shorter LTL compared with controls (p = 0.029). Mendelian randomization analysis showed no association between BD and genetically determined LTL. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our data support previous findings showing that long-term lithium treatment might protect against telomere shortening.
