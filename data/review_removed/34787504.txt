Building an information system to facilitate pharmacogenomics clinical translation with clinical decision support.
Pharmacogenomics clinical decision support (PGx-CDS) is an important tool to incorporate PGx information into existing clinical workflows and facilitate PGx clinical translation. However, due to the lack of a computable formalization to represent the primary PGx knowledge, the complexity of genomics information and the lag of current commercial electronic health record (EHR) system for precision medicine, it is difficult to develop computerized PGx-CDS. Therefore, we explored a novel approach to build an information system, named the Pharmacogenomics Clinical Translation Platform (PCTP), for PGx clinical implementation. The PCTP can represent, store, and manage the primary PGx knowledge in a structured and computable format. Moreover, it has the potential to provide various PGx-CDS services and simplify the integration of PGx-CDS into EHRs.
