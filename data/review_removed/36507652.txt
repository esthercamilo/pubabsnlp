Correlation between assessment of cytochrome P450 1A2 activity and enzyme activity scores, and their relation to clozapine exposure.
Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is involved in the metabolism of antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine and olanzapine. Personalization of these treatments requires an accurate estimation of CYP1A2 activity. In this study, we aimed (1) to evaluate the correlation between activity score (AS), covariate-corrected activity score (CCS) and the phenotype of CYP1A2 using a caffeine test probe and (2) to investigate their relationship with dose-adjusted clozapine concentrations in a subgroup of the cohort.
