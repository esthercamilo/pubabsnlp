Using a personalized clinical decision support system for bromdihydrochlorphenylbenzodiazepine dosing in patients with anxiety disorders based on the pharmacogenomic markers.
Although pharmacogenetic tests provide the information on a genotype and the predicted phenotype, these tests themselves do not provide the interpretation of data for a physician. There are currently approximately two dozen pharmacogenomic clinical decision support systems used in psychiatry. Implementation of clinical decision support systems capable of forming recommendations on drug and dose selection according to the results of pharmacogenetic testing is an urgent task. Fulfillment of this task may allow increasing the efficacy of therapy and decreasing the risk of undesirable side effects.
