CYP2C19 Genotype-Dependent Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction Between Voriconazole and Ritonavir-Boosted Atazanavir in Healthy Subjects.
Voriconazole, a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal agent, is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP3A. Genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 not only plays a prominent role in its disposition but may also influence potential drug interactions with CYP450 modulators such as ritonavir. This study assessed 2-way drug interactions of voriconazole added on to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir in both CYP2C19 extensive-metabolizer (EM) and poor-metabolizer (PM) healthy subjects. Each subject received voriconazole alone on days 1-3, followed by a 7-day washout. Atazanavir/ritonavir 300/100 mg once daily was given on days 11-30 and voriconazole on days 21-30. Voriconazole doses were 200 mg (400 mg on days 1 and 21) twice daily and 50 mg (100 mg on days 1 and 21) twice daily for CYP2C19 EM and PM subjects, respectively. On coadministration, voriconazole AUC and C<sub>min</sub> decreased by 33% (90%CI, 22%-42%) and 39% (90%CI, 28%-49%), respectively, in CYP2C19 EMs, whereas voriconazole C<sub>max</sub> and AUC increased 4.4-fold (90%CI, 3.6-fold to 5.4-fold) and 5.6-fold (90%CI, 4.5-fold to 7.0-fold), respectively, in PMs. Adding voriconazole resulted in a 20%-30% decrease in atazanavir C<sub>min</sub> in both EMs and PMs. Ritonavir exposure was generally unchanged in either population. The safety and tolerability profiles of the combination were comparable with atazanavir/ritonavir and voriconazole administered alone. The most frequent adverse events with voriconazole were visual disturbance and headache. Coadministration of voriconazole and atazanavir/ritonavir is not recommended unless the benefit/risk to the patient justifies the use of the combination.
