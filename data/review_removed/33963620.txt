Concomitant use of isavuconazole and CYP3A4/5 inducers: Where pharmacogenetics meets pharmacokinetics.
Isavuconazole is a triazole antifungal drug, approved for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Isavuconazole is metabolised by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and it has been shown that the CYP3A inducer rifampin reduces isavuconazole exposure. By extrapolation, the concomitant use of isavuconazole with moderate and strong CYP450 inducers is contraindicated, although it is known that some CYP450 inducers are less potent in comparison with rifampin.
