Pharmacogenomic Biomarkers of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Receptor Malfunction in Females with Impaired Ovarian Response-A Genetic Survey.
Follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) plays an essential role as one of the most important molecules in response to some of infertility related medications. Impaired ovarian reserve and poor response to such treatments are partially dependent on the FSHR molecule itself. However, the function and drug sensitivity for this receptor may change due to various allele and polymorphisms in the <i>FSHR</i> gene. Studies indicated some of the FSHR-mediated treatments utilized in clinical centers display different outcomes in specific populations, which may arise from FSHR altered genotypes in certain patients. To support the increased demands for reaching the personalized drug and hormone therapy in clinics, focusing on actionable variants through Pharmacogenomic analysis of this receptor may be necessary. The current study tries to display a perspective view on genetic assessments for Pharmacogenomic profiling of the <i>FSHR</i> gene via providing a systematic and critical overview on the genetics of FSHR and its diverse responses to ligands for infertility treatment in females with impaired ovarian responses and show the potential effects of the patient genetic make-up on related binding substances efficacy. All identified functional drug-related alleles were selected through a comprehensive literature search and analyzed. Advanced technologies for the genetic evaluation of them are also discussed properly.
