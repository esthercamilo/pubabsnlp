Distribution of <i>HLA-B</i> Alleles and Haplotypes in Qatari: Recommendation for Establishing Pharmacogenomic Markers Screening for Drug Hypersensitivity.
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins are present at the cellular surface of antigen-presenting cells and play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response. Class I genes, specifically certain <i>HLA-B</i> alleles, are associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and are used as pharmacogenetic markers. Although ADRs are a common causes of hospitalization and mortality, the data on the prevalence of <i>HLA-B</i> pharmacogenetics markers in Arab countries are scarce. In this study, we investigated the frequencies of major <i>HLA-B</i> pharmacogenomics markers in the Qatari population. Next-generation sequencing data from 1,098 Qatari individuals were employed for <i>HLA-B</i> typing using HLA-HD version 1.4.0 and IPD-IMGT/HLA database. In addition, <i>HLA-B</i> pharmacogenetics markers were obtained from the HLA Adverse Drug Reaction Database. In total, 469 major <i>HLA-B</i> pharmacogenetic markers were identified, with <i>HLA-B</i>*51:01 being the most frequent pharmacogenetic marker (26.67%) in the Qatari population. Moreover, <i>HLA-B</i>*51:01 is associated with phenytoin- and clindamycin-induced ADRs. The second most frequent pharmacogenetic marker was the <i>HLA-B</i>*58:01 allele (6.56%), which is associated with allopurinol-induced ADRs. The third most frequent pharmacogenetic marker was the <i>HLA-B</i>*44:03 allele, which is associated with phenytoin-induced ADRs. The establishment of a pharmacogenetics screening program in Qatar for cost effective interventions aimed at preventing drug-induced hypersensitivity can be aided by the highly prevalent <i>HLA-B</i> pharmacogenetic markers detected here.
