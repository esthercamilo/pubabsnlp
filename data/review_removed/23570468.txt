The future of pharmacogenetics for osteoporosis.
The possibility to predict the outcome of medical treatments, both in terms of efficacy and development of adverse effects, is the main goal of modern personalized medicine. The principal aim of pharmacogenetics is to design specific predictive genetic tests, to be performed prior to any drug treatment, and to tailor the therapy for each patient based on the results of these tests. Few pharmacogenetic tests are today validated and commonly applied in clinical practice, and none in the area of osteoporosis and bone disorders. Surely, the complex regulation of bone metabolism and the involvement of numerous different molecular pathways makes it difficult to individuate responsible genes and polymorphisms involved in the modulation of anti-osteoporotic drug response and, subsequently, in designing specific predictive analyses.
