The Festival of Genetics and Personalized Medicine.
Implementation of personalized medicine in the clinic is a lengthy and multifaceted approach that is also dependent on the raising of the general public's awareness of genomics. The Festival of Genetics and Personalized Medicine aims to familiarize the general public with the principles and applications of genetics and personalized medicine using numerous approaches - namely, a theatrical performance; a roundtable discussion of emerging topics in the field, such as pharmacogenomics, clinical genetics, bioinformatics, bioethics and health economics; the 'Genome: Unlocking Life's Code' exhibition, with its do-it-yourself format; and a live demonstration of 2MoBiL, a portable molecular biology laboratory. This festival attracted more than 900 participants and helped disseminate to a broader audience the principles of genetics and personalized medicine.
