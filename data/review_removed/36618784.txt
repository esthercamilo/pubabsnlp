Refinement of a pharmacogenomics app for dosing guidelines for oncology: findings from the usability evaluation.
This study extended a precision medicine clinical decision support mobile application (app) for use with oncology medications. Two gene variants (<i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>DPYD</i>) associated with pharmacogenomic dosing algorithms in oncology was added to a prototype app. Usability of the app was evaluated. The use of smartphones and mobile apps for prescribing medications has exponentially increased since the introduction of physician order entry. Decision support apps have improved provider performance and studies have shown broader adoption is crucial for the success of these tools. Therefore, successful use of mobile apps will depend on perceptions of users. Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation theory will be the guiding framework for this study.
