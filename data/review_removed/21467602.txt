Cutaneous adverse drug reactions in children: an analysis of reports from the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety (CPNDS).
Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs) are the most prevalent adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in hospitalized children, with an estimated rate of 2-3%. The Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety (CPNDS) is a pan-Canadian active surveillance network identifying genomic biomarkers of risk for serious ADRs. The purpose of this paper is to describe the characteristics of paediatric CADR cases reported to the CPNDS from February 2005 to December 2008. The CPNDS database was mined and details of CADRs and key clinical data from cases were extracted. Reports were individually analyzed and classified in two main groups: severe and non-severe CADRs, with subcategories. In total, 326 CADR cases were included in the study; 214 (65.6%) severe and 112 (34.4%) non-severe CADRs. Overall L-asparaginase (n=56, 16%), amoxicillin (n=29, 8.3%), cotrimoxazole (n=25, 7.2%), carbamazepine (n=17, 4.9%) and lamotrigine (n=13, 3.7%) accounted for 40% of all suspected medications. We have demonstrated the ability to comprehensively collect clinical data on a wide range of severe and non-severe CADRs to drugs commonly used in the care of children. Our study provides additional real world evidence to promote the proactive detection, collection, reporting and assessment of CADRs in children.
