Impact of Vitamin D Supplementation on the Clinical Outcomes and Epigenetic Markers in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome.
Vitamin D has recently been found to influence the renin-angiotensin system (RAS); it can reduce the effects of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI) by decreasing plasma renin. This study examines the effect of vitamin D supplements on cardiac fibrosis markers, echocardiographic parameters, and epigenetic markers in patients with established acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It also looks at the incidence of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms <i>Apa I (rs7975232), Bsm I (rs1544410), Taq I (rs731236),</i> and <i>Fok I (rs2228570)</i> and its association with the development of secondary major acute cardiovascular events (MACE) and heart failure (HF). A randomized controlled trial in which patients were divided into two groups was performed. Group 1 comprised of 125 ACS patients who received ACS standard therapy alone, while Group 2 consisted of 125 ACS patients who received ACS standard therapy plus vitamin D according to their vitamin D levels. Patients were monitored for 24 months to find subsequent MACE and HF. Vitamin D therapy for ACS patients resulted in a substantial decline in end systolic and end diastolic volumes (<i>p</i> = 0.0075 and 0.002, respectively), procollagen type III N-terminal peptide (PIIINP) and soluble ST2 levels (<i>p</i> = 0.007 and 0.001, respectively), as well as in ejection fraction and vitamin D level (<i>p</i> = 0.0001 and 0.008, respectively). In addition, vitamin D treatment was linked to a significant decline in the levels of noncoding RNA, such as mir361, lncRNA MEG3, and lncRNA Chaer (<i>p</i> = 2.9 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, 2.2 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, and 1.2 × 10<sup>-5</sup>, respectively). Furthermore, patients who suffered MACE had significantly higher levels of the <i>Bsm I CC</i> and <i>Fok I GG</i> genotypes (<i>p</i> = 4.8 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and 0.003, respectively), while patients with HF had significantly higher levels of the <i>Taq I AA</i> genotype (<i>p</i> = 4.2 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Supplementing ACS patients with vitamin D has been demonstrated to limit cardiac fibrosis and echocardiographic parameters, as well as epigenetic markers. Additionally, MACE and HF among ACS patients may be related to genetic variations among VDR gene polymorphisms.
