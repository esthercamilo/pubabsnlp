Pharmacogenomics as a Competitive Strategy for Compounding Pharmacies.
Patients' responses to medical treatment vary greatly; while many may benefit from pharmacological therapy, others may suffer from harmful drug reactions or show no response at all. To provide an effective individualized care, one must understand the elements that lead to varying patient outcomes and how these factors may interplay in an individual's treatment outcome. Pharmacogenomics is the future of pharmacy, and there is a growing demand for this service. Compounding pharmacies are already at the forefront of meeting patients' unique drug requirements. This gives them the opportunity to provide their patients with more valuable services than only selling drugs dictated by the formula! This article discusses pharmacogenomics as a competitive strategy for compounding pharmacies.
