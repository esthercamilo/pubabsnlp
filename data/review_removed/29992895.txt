Nanovehicle-based Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Delivery for Therapeutic Purposes: A New Molecular Approach in Pharmacogenomics.
RNA interference (RNAi) is a process for regulating the gene expression in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silence target genes. siRNA-based therapy as a new molecular treatment approach, offers therapeutic prospects for many common diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Nevertheless, the efficacy of siRNA delivery has, so far, remained a challenging issue. This is due to their easy degradation through the circulation system and the difficulties in the intracellular delivery to specific tissues where they silence the target genes. There have been many efforts to develop suitable, safe and effective siRNA delivery systems in the past decades. These efforts specifically aimed to protect siRNA from serum nucleases and deliver it to an intracellular region in the desired target cells. In this context, one of the new and popular approaches is nanovehicle-mediated siRNA delivery systems.
