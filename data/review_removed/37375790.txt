Bioinformatics Tools for the Analysis of Active Compounds Identified in Ranunculaceae Species.
The chemical compounds from extracts of three Ranunculaceae species, <i>Aconitum toxicum</i> Rchb., <i>Anemone nemorosa</i> L. and <i>Helleborus odorus</i> Waldst. & Kit. ex Willd., respectively, were isolated using the HPLC purification technique and analyzed from a bioinformatics point of view. The classes of compounds identified based on the proportion in the rhizomes/leaves/flowers used for microwave-assisted extraction and ultrasound-assisted extraction were alkaloids and phenols. Here, the quantifying of pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomics and pharmacodynamics helps us to identify the actual biologically active compounds. Our results showed that (i) pharmacokinetically, the compounds show good absorption at the intestinal level and high permeability at the level of the central nervous system for alkaloids; (ii) regarding pharmacogenomics, alkaloids can influence tumor sensitivity and the effectiveness of some treatments; (iii) and pharmacodynamically, the compounds of these Ranunculaceae species bind to carbonic anhydrase and aldose reductase. The results obtained showed a high affinity of the compounds in the binding solution at the level of carbonic anhydrases. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors extracted from natural sources can represent the path to new drugs useful both in the treatment of glaucoma, but also of some renal, neurological and even neoplastic diseases. The identification of natural compounds with the role of inhibitors can have a role in different types of pathologies, both associated with studied and known receptors such as carbonic anhydrase and aldose reductase, as well as new pathologies not yet addressed.
