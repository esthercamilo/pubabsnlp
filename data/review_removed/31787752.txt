Pharmacogenomic biomarker information differences between drug labels in the United States and Hungary: implementation from medical practitioner view.
Pharmacogenomic biomarker availability of Hungarian Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPC) was assembled and compared with the information in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labels of the same active substance (July 2019). The level of action of these biomarkers was assessed from The Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase database. From the identified 264 FDA approved drugs with pharmacogenomic biomarkers in drug label, 195 are available in Hungary. From them, 165 drugs include pharmacogenomic data disposing 222 biomarkers. Most of them are metabolizing enzymes (46%) and pharmacological targets (41%). The most frequent therapeutic area is oncology (37%), followed by infectious diseases (12%) and psychiatry (9%) (p < 0.00001). Most common biomarkers in Hungarian SmPCs are CYP2D6, CYP2C19, estrogen and progesterone hormone receptor (ESR, PGS). Importantly, US labels present more specific pharmacogenomic subheadings, the level of action has a different prominence, and offer more applicable dose modifications than Hungarians (5% vs 3%). However, Hungarian SmPCs are at 9 oncology drugs stricter than FDA, testing is obligatory before treatment. Out of the biomarkers available in US drug labels, 62 are missing completely from Hungarian SmPCs (p < 0.00001). Most of these belong to oncology (42%) and in case of 11% of missing biomarkers testing is required before treatment. In conclusion, more factual, clear, clinically relevant pharmacogenomic information in Hungarian SmPCs would reinforce implementation of pharmacogenetics. Underpinning future perspective is to support regulatory stakeholders to enhance inclusion of pharmacogenomic biomarkers into Hungarian drug labels and consequently enhance personalized medicine in Hungary.
