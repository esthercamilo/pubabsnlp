<i>MIR27A</i> Gene Polymorphism Modifies the Effect of Common <i>DPYD</i> Gene Variants on Severe Toxicity in Patients with Gastrointestinal Tumors Treated with Fluoropyrimidine-Based Anticancer Therapy.
To reduce severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity, pharmacogenetic guidelines recommend a dose reduction for carriers of four high-risk variants in the <i>DPYD</i> gene (*2A, *13, c.2846A>T, HapB3). The polymorphism in the <i>MIR27A</i> gene has been shown to enhance the predictive value of these variants. Our study aimed to explore whether rs895819 in the <i>MIR27A</i> gene modifies the effect of five common <i>DPYD</i> variants: c.1129-5923C>G (rs75017182, HapB3), c.2194G>A (rs1801160, *6), c.1601G>A (rs1801158, *4), c.496A>G (rs2297595), and c.85T>C (rs1801265, *9A). The study included 370 Caucasian patients with gastrointestinal tumors who received fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy. Genotyping was performed using high-resolution melting analysis. The <i>DPYD</i>*6 allele was associated with overall severe toxicity and neutropenia with an increased risk particularly pronounced in patients carrying the <i>MIR27A</i> variant. All carriers of <i>DPYD</i>*6 exhibited an association with asthenia regardless of their <i>MIR27A</i> status. The increased risk of neutropenia in patients with c.496G was only evident in those co-carrying the <i>MIR27A</i> variant. <i>DPYD</i>*4 was also significantly linked to neutropenia risk in co-carriers of the <i>MIR27A</i> variant. Thus, we have demonstrated the predictive value of the *6, *4, and c.496G alleles of the <i>DPYD</i> gene, considering the modifying effect of the <i>MIR27A</i> polymorphism.
