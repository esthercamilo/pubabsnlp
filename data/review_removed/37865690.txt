Computational prognostic evaluation of Alzheimer's drugs from FDA-approved database through structural conformational dynamics and drug repositioning approaches.
Drug designing is high-priced and time taking process with low success rate. To overcome this obligation, computational drug repositioning technique is being promptly used to predict the possible therapeutic effects of FDA approved drugs against multiple diseases. In this computational study, protein modeling, shape-based screening, molecular docking, pharmacogenomics, and molecular dynamic simulation approaches have been utilized to retrieve the FDA approved drugs against AD. The predicted MADD protein structure was designed by homology modeling and characterized through different computational resources. Donepezil and galantamine were implanted as standard drugs and drugs were screened out based on structural similarities. Furthermore, these drugs were evaluated and based on binding energy (Kcal/mol) profiles against MADD through PyRx tool. Moreover, pharmacogenomics analysis showed good possible associations with AD mediated genes and confirmed through detail literature survey. The best 6 drug (darifenacin, astemizole, tubocurarine, elacridar, sertindole and tariquidar) further docked and analyzed their interaction behavior through hydrogen binding. Finally, MD simulation study were carried out on these drugs and evaluated their stability behavior by generating root mean square deviation and fluctuations (RMSD/F), radius of gyration (Rg) and soluble accessible surface area (SASA) graphs. Taken together, darifenacin, astemizole, tubocurarine, elacridar, sertindole and tariquidar displayed good lead like profile as compared with standard and can be used as possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of AD after in-vitro and in-vivo assessment.
