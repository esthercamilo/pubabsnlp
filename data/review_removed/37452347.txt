Pharmacovariome scanning using whole pharmacogene resequencing coupled with deep computational analysis and machine learning for clinical pharmacogenomics.
This pilot study aims to identify and functionally assess pharmacovariants in whole exome sequencing data. While detection of known variants has benefited from pharmacogenomic-dedicated bioinformatics tools before, in this paper we have tested novel deep computational analysis in addition to artificial intelligence as possible approaches for functional analysis of unknown markers within less studied drug-related genes.
