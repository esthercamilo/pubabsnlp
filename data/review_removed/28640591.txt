Managing Psychotropic Medications in Complex, Real-World Patients Using Comprehensive Therapeutic Drug Monitoring.
There are multiple treatment options for depression, anxiety, psychosis, and other psychiatric disorders, and psychiatry patients are often comorbid with complex, polypharmacy treatment regimens. Unlike cardiovascular disease and diabetes, there are no readily available biomarkers to gauge treatment success with psychotropic medications, often resulting in subjective determination of medication therapy effectiveness. The physiochemical properties of psychiatric medications in general lend themselves to quantitative measurement in blood, offering an avenue to optimize treatment for each patient. Herein, we describe a novel application that employs comprehensive therapeutic drug monitoring of both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medications to holistically personalize therapy for complex psychiatry patients.
