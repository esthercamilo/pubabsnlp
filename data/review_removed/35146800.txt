Alpelisib to treat CLOVES syndrome, a member of the PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndrome spectrum.
CLOVES syndrome is a rare congenital overgrowth disorder caused by mutations in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) gene. It is part of the PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndrome (PROS) spectrum and its treatment is challenging. PROS malformations have traditionally been treated by surgery, but research into pharmacological treatments capable of blocking the PIK/AKT/mTOR pathway has increased over the past decade. The results have been promising and suggest that compassionate use of these treatments in patients with PROS disorders could have clinical benefits. Another promising drug is alpelisib (BYL719), which is a selective inhibitor that competitively binds to the p110a subunit of PIK3 in the intracellular PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. Compassionate use of low-dose alpelisib had striking effects in an uncontrolled case series of 19 PROS patients, several with life-threatening complications. Moreover, there were few adverse effects and the treatment did not impair linear growth, despite the young age of many of the patients. We present the case of a patient with CLOVES syndrome who was started on compassionate treatment with alpelisib after surgical debulking of a cystic lymphangioma and treatment with sirolimus. This promising drug significantly reduced the size of the lymphangioma and prevented progression of the tissue overgrowth in the gluteal region. This case suggests that low-dose PI3K inhibition may provide collateral benefits that extend beyond mitigation of disease-specific features of PROS.
