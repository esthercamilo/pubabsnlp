Potential of pharmacogenetics in minimizing drug therapy problems in cystic fibrosis.
With advancements in CF drug development, people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) now take a median of seven medications daily, increasing treatment complexity, risk of drug therapy problems (DTPs), and interference with treatment goals. Given that some of these DTPs can be prevented with preemptive pharmacogenetic testing, the overall goal of this study was to test the clinical utility of a multi-gene pharmacogenetics (PGx) panel in potentially reducing DTPs in PwCF.
