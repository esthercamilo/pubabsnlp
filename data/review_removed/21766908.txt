Development of cocaine-induced interstitial lung damage in two CYP2C and VKORC1 variant allele carriers.
Often, the connection between drug use and the development of related inflammatory damage or idiosyncratic toxicities is hard to recognize and objectify. The presence of cytochrome P450 (CYP) variant genotypes appears to be a substantial susceptibility risk factor in the development of drug-induced pulmonary adverse events. We hypothesized that the presence of variant alleles may be associated with serious complications of illicit drug use.
