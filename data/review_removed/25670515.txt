Pharmacogenetics of opioid response.
For opioids requiring CYP2D6 O-demethylation to active metabolites, poor metabolizers have reduced metabolite formation and minimal pain reduction. Clinically, this has only reliably been shown for tramadol. Ultra-rapid metabolizers have an increased risk of toxicity especially for codeine. ABCB1 genetics show no consistent findings. In Asian populations, the high OPRM1 118A>G frequency associates with higher opioid dosage requirements. Clinical translation of opioid genetics is premature because many important pain and addiction phenotype factors contribute.
