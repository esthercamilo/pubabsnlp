Low-frequency variants at the <i>CYP2C9</i> locus among Puerto Rican patients on warfarin: <i>in silico</i> predictions of functionality and conservation.
<b>Aim:</b> Perform <i>in silico</i> predictions of functional consequences of <i>CYP2C9</i> variants identified by next-generation sequencing in Puerto Ricans. <b>Methods:</b> Identified low-frequency <i>CYP2C9</i> variants (minor allele frequencies <2%) were evaluated using the Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD v1.3) tools and molecular modeling/docking analysis to predict impact on CYP2C9 activity. <b>Results:</b><i>CYP2C9*5</i>,<i>*8</i>,<i>*9</i>,<i>*11</i>,<i>*12,*21</i> and a novel <i>*61</i> induce conformational changes that affect the binding site of <i>S</i>-warfarin. Most of these deleterious variants occur at higher frequency among individuals with large African ancestry. <b>Conclusion:</b> The unfavorable distance of <i>S</i>-warfarin from heme group, and low-binding interactions due to these <i>CYP2C9</i> variants, suggest major complications during warfarin therapy. This study contributes to the field by predicting functional alterations of rare <i>CYP2C9</i> variants for the first time in Hispanics.
