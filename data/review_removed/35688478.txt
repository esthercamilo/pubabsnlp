Zhx2 Is a Candidate Gene Underlying Oxymorphone Metabolite Brain Concentration Associated with State-Dependent Oxycodone Reward.
Understanding the pharmacogenomics of opioid metabolism and behavior is vital to therapeutic success, as mutations can dramatically alter therapeutic efficacy and addiction liability. We found robust, sex-dependent BALB/c substrain differences in oxycodone behaviors and whole brain concentration of oxycodone metabolites. BALB/cJ females showed robust state-dependent oxycodone reward learning as measured via conditioned place preference when compared with the closely related BALB/cByJ substrain. Accordingly, BALB/cJ females also showed a robust increase in brain concentration of the inactive metabolite noroxycodone and the active metabolite oxymorphone compared with BALB/cByJ mice. Oxymorphone is a highly potent, full agonist at the mu opioid receptor that could enhance drug-induced interoception and state-dependent oxycodone reward learning. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in a BALB/c F2 reduced complexity cross revealed one major QTL on chromosome 15 underlying brain oxymorphone concentration that explained 32% of the female variance. BALB/cJ and BALB/cByJ differ by fewer than 10,000 variants, which can greatly facilitate candidate gene/variant identification. Hippocampal and striatal cis-expression QTL (eQTL) and exon-level eQTL analysis identified <i>Zhx2</i>, a candidate gene coding for a transcriptional repressor with a private BALB/cJ retroviral insertion that reduces <i>Zhx2</i> expression and sex-dependent dysregulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Whole brain proteomics corroborated the <i>Zhx2</i> eQTL and identified upregulated CYP2D11 that could increase brain oxymorphone in BALB/cJ females. To summarize, <i>Zhx2</i> is a highly promising candidate gene underlying brain oxycodone metabolite levels. Future studies will validate <i>Zhx2</i> and its site of action using reciprocal gene editing and tissue-specific viral manipulations in BALB/c substrains. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Our findings show that genetic variation can result in sex-specific alterations in whole brain concentration of a bioactive opioid metabolite after oxycodone administration, reinforcing the need for sex as a biological factor in pharmacogenomic studies. The cooccurrence of female-specific increased oxymorphone and state-dependent reward learning suggests that this minor yet potent and efficacious metabolite of oxycodone could increase opioid interoception and drug-cue associative learning of opioid reward, which has implications for cue-induced relapse of drug-seeking behavior and for precision pharmacogenetics.
