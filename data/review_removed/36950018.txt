Pharmacogenetic association of the <i>NR1H3</i> promoter variant with antihypertensive response among patients with hypertension: A longitudinal study.
<b>Background:</b> The genetic factors in assessing therapeutic efficacy and predicting antihypertensive drug response are unclear. Therefore, this study aims to identify the associations between variants and antihypertensive drug response. <b>Methods:</b> A longitudinal study including 1837 hypertensive patients was conducted in Northern China and followed up for a median 2.24 years. The associations of 11 candidate variants with blood pressure changes in response to antihypertensive drugs and with the risk of cardiovascular events during the follow-up were examined. The dual-luciferase assay was carried out to assess the effect of genetic variants on gene transcriptional activity. <b>Results:</b> The variant rs11039149A>G in the promoter of nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 3 (<i>NR1H3</i>) was associated with the change in systolic blood pressure (ΔSBP) in response to calcium channel blockers (CCBs) monotherapy. Patients carrying rs11039149AG genotype showed a significant increase of systolic blood pressure (SBP) at follow-up compared with AA carriers, and the difference of ΔSBP between AG and AA carriers was 5.94 mm Hg (95%CI: 2.09-9.78, <i>p</i> = 0.002). In 1,184 patients with CCBs therapy, SBP levels decreased in AA carriers, but increased in AG carriers, the difference of ΔSBP between AG and AA carriers was 8.04 mm Hg (95%CI: 3.28-12.81, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Further analysis in 359 patients with CCBs monotherapy, the difference of ΔSBP between AG and AA carriers was 15.25 mm Hg (95%CI: 6.48-24.02, <i>p</i> = 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in ΔSBP between AG and AA carriers with CCBs multitherapy. The rs11039149A>G was not associated with the cardiovascular events incidence during the follow-up. Additionally, transcriptional factor forkhead box C1 (<i>FOXC1</i>) bound to the <i>NR1H3</i> promoter containing rs11039149A and significantly increased the transcriptional activity, while rs11039149 A to G change led to a loss-of-function and disabled <i>FOXC1</i> binding. For the other 10 variants, associations with blood pressure changes or risk of cardiovascular events were not observed. <b>Conclusion:</b> Hypertensive patients with rs11039149AG genotype in the <i>NR1H3</i> gene have a significant worse SBP control in response to CCBs monotherapy compared with AA carriers. Our findings suggest that the <i>NR1H3</i> gene might act as a promising genetic factor to affect individual sensitivity to antihypertensive drugs.
