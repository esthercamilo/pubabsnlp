The clinical utility of combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing for patients with depression: a meta-analysis.
<b>Aim:</b> To perform a meta-analysis of prospective, two-arm studies examining the clinical utility of using the combinatorial pharmacogenomic test, GeneSight Psychotropic, to inform treatment decisions for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). <b>Patients & methods:</b> The pooled mean effect of symptom improvement and pooled relative risk ratio (RR) of response and remission were calculated using a random effect model. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 1556 patients were included from four studies, with outcomes evaluated at week 8 or week 10. Patient outcomes were significantly improved for patients with MDD whose care was guided by the combinatorial pharmacogenomic test results compared with unguided care (symptom improvement Δ = 10.08%, 95% CI: 1.67-18.50; p = 0.019; response RR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.17-1.67; p < 0.001; remission RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.17-1.89; p = 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> GeneSight Psychotropic guided care improves outcomes among patients with MDD.
