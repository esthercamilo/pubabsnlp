Pharmacogenetics of the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2.
The solute carrier, human organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2, OATP-A, OATP1 and OATP) is highly expressed in the intestine, kidney, cholangiocytes and the blood-brain barrier. This localization suggests that OATP1A2 may be vitally important in the absorption, distribution and excretion of a broad array of clinically important drugs. Several nonsynonymous polymorphisms have been identified in the gene encoding OATP1A2, SLCO1A2 (SLC21A3), with some of these variants demonstrating functional changes in the transport of OATP1A2 substrates.
