Topic Evolution Analysis for Omics Data Integration in Cancers.
One of the vital challenges for cancer diseases is efficient biomarkers monitoring formation and development are limited. Omics data integration plays a crucial role in the mining of biomarkers in the human condition. As the link between omics study on biomarkers discovery and cancer diseases is deepened, defining the principal technologies applied in the field is a must not only for the current period but also for the future. We utilize topic modeling to extract topics (or themes) as a probabilistic distribution of latent topics from the dataset. To predict the future trend of related cases, we utilize the Prophet neural network to perform a prediction correction model for existing topics. A total of 2,318 pieces of literature (from 2006 to 2020) were retrieved from MEDLINE with the query on "omics" and "cancer." Our study found 20 topics covering current research types. The topic extraction results indicate that, with the rapid development of omics data integration research, multi-omics analysis (Topic 11) and genomics of colorectal cancer (Topic 10) have more studies reported last 15 years. From the topic prediction view, research findings in multi-omics data processing and novel biomarker discovery for cancer prediction (Topic 2, 3, 10, 11) will be heavily focused in the future. From the topic visuallization and evolution trends, metabolomics of breast cancer (Topic 9), pharmacogenomics (Topic 15), genome-guided therapy regimens (Topic 16), and microRNAs target genes (Topic 17) could have more rapidly developed in the study of cancer treatment effect and recurrence prediction.
