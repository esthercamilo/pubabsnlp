Influence of <i>APOA5</i> Locus on the Treatment Efficacy of Three Statins: Evidence From a Randomized Pilot Study in Chinese Subjects.
Pharmacogenetics or pharmacogenomics approaches are important for addressing the individual variabilities of drug efficacy especially in the era of precision medicine. One particular interesting gene to investigate is <i>APOA5</i>, which has been repeatedly linked with the inter-individual variations of serum triglycerides. Here, we explored <i>APOA5</i>-statin interactions in 195 Chinese subjects randomized to rosuvastatin (5-10 mg/day), atorvastatin (10-20 mg/day), or simvastatin (40 mg/day) for 12 weeks by performing a targeted genotyping analysis of the <i>APOA5</i> promoter SNP rs662799 (-1131T > C). There were no significant differences between the treatment arms for any of the statin-induced changes in clinical biomarkers. Reductions in LDL cholesterol were influenced by the <i>APOA5</i> genotype in all three treatment groups. By contrast, changes in HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were only affected by the <i>APOA5</i> genotype in the atorvastatin and simvastatin groups and not in the rosuvastatin group. Our results suggest that future studies may need to consider stratifying subjects not only by genetic background but also by prescribed statin type.
