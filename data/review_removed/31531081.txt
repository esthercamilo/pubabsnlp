Comparison of Two Different Techniques Of Warfarin Dosing Determination - A Chemometrics Study.
A high prevalence of genetic polymorphisms increases sensitivity to warfarin therapy. In this study, we investigated 47 patients with effective long-term therapy by warfarin well-controlled by monitoring of International Normalised Ratio (INR). All patients were tested for gene polymorphisms VKORC1, CYP2C9*C2, and CYP2C9*C3, which were used for a dose calculation employing a program www.WarfarinDosing.org. The main goal was to investigate whether the warfarin doses determined by INR are in accordance with the doses calculated according to the pharmacogenetic algorithm. For this purpose, several chemometric tools, namely principal component analysis, cluster analysis, correlation analysis, correspondence analysis, Passing-Bablock regression, Bland-Altman method, descriptive statistics, and ANOVA were used. We also analysed the relationship between the dose of warfarin determined by INR and several constitutional and genetic factors. Statistically significant association between clinically optimized warfarin dose and indication for the treatment, age, and warfarin sensitivity determined by VKORC1, CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms were confirmed. Finally, we confirmed a good concordance between the INR determined warfarin doses and pharmacogenetic approach.
