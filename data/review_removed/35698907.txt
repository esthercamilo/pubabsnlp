The influence of <i>TNIK</i> gene polymorphisms on risperidone response in a Chinese Han population.
<b>Aim:</b> To investigate whether the <i>TNIK</i> gene affects risperidone treatment outcomes in the Chinese population. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 148 unrelated inpatients who received risperidone for six weeks were enrolled. The selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs2088885, rs7627954 and rs13065441) were genotyped using the MassARRAY<sup>®</sup> SNP IPLEX platform. <b>Results:</b> The analysis showed that one novel SNP of <i>TNIK</i>, rs7627954, had a significant association with the response to risperidone (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.472; p = 0.034). This work also identified rs2088885 as significantly associated with risperidone response (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.257; p = 0.022). The result revealed that the rs2088885-rs7627954 C-T haplotype was more prevalent in good responders than in poor responders (p = 0.0278). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study revealed that the rs2088885 and rs7627954 SNPs of <i>TNIK</i> are associated with risperidone treatment response.
