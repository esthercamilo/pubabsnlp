Pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic modelling of the CYP3A activity marker 4Î²-hydroxycholesterol during efavirenz treatment and efavirenz/rifampicin co-treatment.
To assess the effect of the major efavirenz metabolizing enzyme (CYP2B6) genotype and the effects of rifampicin co-treatment on induction of CYP3A by efavirenz.
