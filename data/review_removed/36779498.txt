Functional Characterization of Six <i>SLCO1B1</i> (OATP1B1) Variants Observed in Finnish Individuals with a Psychotic Disorder.
Variants in the <i>SLCO1B1</i> (solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1) gene encoding the OATP1B1 (organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1) protein are associated with altered transporter function that can predispose patients to adverse drug effects with statin treatment. We explored the effect of six rare <i>SLCO1B1</i> single nucleotide variants (SNVs) occurring in Finnish individuals with a psychotic disorder on expression and functionality of the OATP1B1 protein. The SUPER-Finland study has performed exome sequencing on 9381 individuals with at least one psychotic episode during their lifetime. <i>SLCO1B1</i> SNVs were annotated with PHRED-scaled combined annotation-dependent (CADD) scores and the Ensembl variant effect predictor. In vitro functionality studies were conducted for the SNVs with a PHRED-scaled CADD score of >10 and predicted to be missense. To estimate possible changes in transport activity caused by the variants, transport of 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in OATP1B1-expressing HEK293 cells was measured. According to the findings, additional tests with rosuvastatin and estrone sulfate were conducted. The amount of OATP1B1 in crude membrane fractions was quantified using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based quantitative targeted absolute proteomics analysis. Six rare missense variants of <i>SLCO1B1</i> were identified in the study population, located in transmembrane helix 3: c.317T>C (p.106I>T), intracellular loop 2: c.629G>T (p.210G>V), c.633A>G (p.211I>M), c.639T>A (p.213N>L), transmembrane helix 6: 820A>G (p.274I>V), and the C-terminal end: 2005A>C (p.669N>H). Of these variants, <i>SLCO1B1</i> c.629G>T (p.210G>V) resulted in the loss of in vitro function, abolishing the uptake of DCF, estrone sulfate, and rosuvastatin and reducing the membrane protein expression to 31% of reference OATP1B1. Of the six rare missense variants, <i>SLCO1B1</i> c.629G>T (p.210G>V) causes a loss of function of OATP1B1 transport in vitro and severely decreases membrane protein abundance. Carriers of <i>SLCO1B1</i> c.629G>T might be susceptible to altered pharmacokinetics of OATP1B1 substrate drugs and might have increased likelihood of adverse drug effects such as statin-associated musculoskeletal symptoms.
