A Prognostic and Carboplatin Response Predictive Model in Ovarian Cancer: A Mono-Institutional Retrospective Study Based on Clinics and Pharmacogenomics.
Carboplatin is the cornerstone of ovarian cancer (OC) treatment, while platinum-response, dependent on interindividual variability, is the major prognostic factor for long-term outcomes. This retrospective study was focused on explorative search of genetic polymorphisms in the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME) genes for the identification of biomarkers prognostic/predictive of platinum-response in OC patients. Ninety-two advanced OC patients treated with carboplatin-based therapy were enrolled at our institution. Of these, we showed that 72% of patients were platinum-sensitive, with a significant benefit in terms of OS (<i>p</i> = 0.001). We identified an inflammatory-score with a longer OS in patients with lower scores as compared to patients with the maximum score (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Thirty-two patients were genotyped for 1931 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and five copy number variations (CNVs) by the DMET Plus array platform. Among prognostic polymorphisms, we found a potential role of UGT2A1 both as a predictor of platinum-response (<i>p</i> = 0.01) and as prognostic of survival (<i>p</i> = 0.05). Finally, we identified 24 SNPs related to OS. UGT2A1 correlates to an "inflammatory-score" and retains a potential prognostic role in advanced OC. These data provide a proof of concept that warrants further validation in follow-up studies for the definition of novel biomarkers in this aggressive disease.
