Pharmacogenetics of ABCB1, CDA, DCK, GSTT1, GSTM1 and outcomes in a cohort of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients from Colombia.
Different studies have shown pharmacogenetic variants related to drug toxicity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Our aim was to identify the association between ABCB1, CDA, DCK, GSTT1, and GSTM1 variants with clinical outcomes and toxicity in pediatric patients with AML.
