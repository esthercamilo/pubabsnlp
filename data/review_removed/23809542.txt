The CYP2C19*17 variant is not independently associated with clopidogrel response.
Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) is the principal enzyme responsible for converting clopidogrel into its active metabolite, and common genetic variants have been identified, most notably CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*17, that are believed to alter its activity and expression, respectively.
