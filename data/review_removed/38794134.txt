Comprehensive Analysis of Drug Utilization Patterns, Gender Disparities, Lifestyle Influences, and Genetic Factors: Insights from Elderly Cohort Using g-Nomic<sup>®</sup> Software.
Polypharmacy is a global healthcare concern, especially among the elderly, leading to drug interactions and adverse reactions, which are significant causes of death in developed nations. However, the integration of pharmacogenetics can help mitigate these risks. In this study, the data from 483 patients, primarily elderly and polymedicated, were analyzed using Eugenomic<sup>®</sup>'s personalized prescription software, g-Nomic<sup>®</sup>. The most prescribed drug classes included antihypertensives, platelet aggregation inhibitors, cholesterol-lowering drugs, and gastroprotective medications. Drug-lifestyle interactions primarily involved inhibitions but also included inductions. Interactions were analyzed considering gender. Significant genetic variants identified in the study encompassed <i>ABCB1, SLCO1B1, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ABCG2, NAT2, SLC22A1</i>, and <i>G6PD</i>. To prevent adverse reactions and enhance medication effectiveness, it is strongly recommended to consider pharmacogenetics testing. This approach shows great promise in optimizing medication regimens and ultimately improving patient outcomes.
