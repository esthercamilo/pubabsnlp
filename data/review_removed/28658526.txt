Reverse pharmacogenomics: carbamazepine normalizes activation and attenuates thermal hyperexcitability of sensory neurons due to Na<sub>v</sub> 1.7 mutation I234T.
Pharmacotherapy for pain currently involves trial and error. A previous study on inherited erythromelalgia (a genetic model of neuropathic pain due to mutations in the sodium channel, Na<sub>v</sub> 1.7) used genomics, structural modelling and biophysical and pharmacological analyses to guide pharmacotherapy and showed that carbamazepine normalizes voltage dependence of activation of the Na<sub>v</sub> 1.7-S241T mutant channel, reducing pain in patients carrying this mutation. However, whether this approach is applicable to other Na<sub>v</sub> channel mutants is still unknown.
