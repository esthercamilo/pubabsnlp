Pharmacogenomic Study Reveals New Variants of Drug Metabolizing Enzyme and Transporter Genes Associated with Steady-State Plasma Concentrations of Risperidone and 9-Hydroxyrisperidone in Thai Autism Spectrum Disorder Patients.
The present study sought to investigate the genetic variants in drug metabolizing enzyme and transporter (DMET) genes associated with steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone among Thai autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. ASD patients taking risperidone for at least 1 month were enrolled for this pharmacogenomic study. Genotyping profile was obtained using Affymetrix DMET Plus array interrogating 1931 variants in 231 genes. Steady-state plasma risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay. The final analysis included 483 markers for 167 genes. Six variants, <i>ABCB11</i> (c.3084A > G, c.<sup>∗</sup>420A > G, c.<sup>∗</sup>368G > A, and c.<sup>∗</sup>236G > A) and <i>ADH7</i> (c.690G > A and c.-5360G > A), were found to be associated with plasma concentrations of risperidone. 9-Hydroxyrisperidone and the total active-moiety levels were associated with six gene variants, <i>SCLO1B1</i> (c.-11187G > A and c.521T > C), <i>SLCO1B3</i> (c.334G > T, c.699A > G, and c.1557G > A), and <i>SLC7A5</i> c.<sup>∗</sup>438C > G. Polymorphisms in <i>UGT2B4</i> c.<sup>∗</sup>448A > G and <i>CYP2D6</i> (c.1661G > C, c.4180G > C, and c.-2178G > A) showed considerable but not significant associations with metabolic ratio. This pharmacogenomic study identifies new genetic variants of DMET genes in monitoring risperidone therapy.
