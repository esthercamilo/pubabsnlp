Pharmacogenetic landscape of pain management variants among Mediterranean populations.
Chronic pain is a major socioeconomic burden in the Mediterranean region. However, we noticed an under-representation of these populations in the pharmacogenetics of pain management studies. In this context, we aimed 1) to decipher the pharmacogenetic variant landscape among Mediterranean populations compared to worldwide populations in order to identify therapeutic biomarkers for personalized pain management and 2) to better understand the biological process of pain management through <i>in silico</i> investigation of pharmacogenes pathways.
