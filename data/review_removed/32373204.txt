The influence of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolism enzymes and transporters on the pharmacokinetics of different fluvastatin formulations.
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of genetic polymorphism on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics. In addition, we compared the fluvastatin pharmacokinetics differences between extended-release (ER) 80 mg tablet and immediate-release (IR) 40 mg capsule in terms of drug metabolism enzyme and transporter genetic polymorphisms. In this open-label, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, crossover study (<i>n</i> = 24), effects of <i>ABCG2, SLCO1B1, ABCB1, CYP2C9</i> and <i>CYP3A5</i> polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin were analyzed. The administration dosage for IR 40 mg and ER 80 mg were twice and once daily, respectively, for total 7 d. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation were taken on the 1st and 7th d. The lower exposure following ER was observed. For ER tablets, <i>SLCO1B1</i> T521C genotype correlated with <i>AUC<sub>0-24</sub></i> of repeat doses (<i>P</i> = 0.010). <i>SLCO1B1</i> T521C genotype had no statistically significant effect on <i>AUC<sub>0-24</sub></i> of IR capsule of fluvastatin after single or repeated doses. <i>In vitro</i> study demonstrated that when the concentration of fluvastatin was low (< 1 µmol/l), the uptake of fluvastatin in the HEK293-OATP1B1 with <i>SLCO1B1</i> 521TT (<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> =0.18 µmol/l) was faster than that with <i>SLCO1B1</i> 521CC (<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> =0.49 µmol/l), On the other hand, when concentration reached to higher level (> 1 µmol/l), transport velocity of fluvastatin by HEK293-OATP1B1 with <i>SLCO1B1</i> 521TT (<i>K<sub>m</sub></i>  = 11.4 µmol/l) and with <i>SLCO1B1</i> 521TCC (<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> =15.1 µmol/l) tend to be the same. It suggests that the increased effect of <i>SLCO1B1</i> T521C genotype on ER formulation of fluvastatin was mainly caused by lower blood concentrations. We recommend that formulation should be incorporated into future pharmacogenomics studies.
