The pharmacogenetics of OATP1B1 variants and their impact on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of elbasvir/grazoprevir.
<b>Aim:</b> To evaluate the effect of <i>SLCO1B1</i> genetic variants on grazoprevir pharmacokinetics and efficacy. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis of 1578 hepatitis C virus-infected participants from ten Phase II/III clinical trials. <b>Results:</b> Relative to noncarriers of the risk allele, geometric mean ratios (95% CI) of grazoprevir area under curve (AUC)<sub>0-24</sub> were: rs4149056 (risk allele C), one copy, 1.13 (1.06-1.21), two copies, 1.43 (1.16-1.77); and rs11045819 (risk allele A), one copy, 0.93 (0.87-1.00); two copies, 0.78 (0.61-1.00). The rs2306283 variant was not associated with grazoprevir exposure. None of the <i>SLCO1B1</i> variants were associated with sustained virologic response. <b>Conclusion:</b> Genetic variants in <i>SLCO1B1</i> were associated with modest changes in grazoprevir pharmacokinetics, but not with meaningful differences in efficacy.
