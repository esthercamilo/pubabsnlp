Individual and Combined Associations of Genetic Variants in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and SLCO1B1 With Simvastatin and Simvastatin Acid Plasma Concentrations.
Our objective was to evaluate the associations of genetic variants affecting simvastatin (SV) and simvastatin acid (SVA) metabolism [the gene encoding cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4)*22 and the gene encoding cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5 (CYP3A5)*3] and transport [the gene encoding solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) T521C] with 12-hour plasma SV and SVA concentrations. The variants were genotyped, and the concentrations were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 646 participants of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics clinical trial of 40 mg/d SV for 6 weeks. The genetic variants were tested for association with 12-hour plasma SV, SVA, or the SVA/SV ratio using general linear models. CYP3A5*3 was not significantly associated with 12-hour plasma SV or SVA concentration. CYP3A4*1/*22 participants had 58% higher 12-hour plasma SV concentration compared with CYP3A4*1/*1 participants (P = 0.006). SLCO1B1 521T/C and 521C/C participants had 71% (P < 0.001) and 248% (P < 0.001) higher 12-hour plasma SVA compared with SLCO1B1 521T/T participants, respectively. CYP3A4 and SLCO1B1 genotypes combined categorized participants into low (<1), intermediate (â‰ˆ1), and high (>1) SVA/SV ratio groups (P = 0.001). In conclusion, CYP3A4*22 and SLCO1B1 521C were significantly associated with increased 12-hour plasma SV and SVA concentrations, respectively. CYP3A5*3 was not significantly associated with 12-hour plasma SV or SVA concentrations. The combination of CYP3A4*22 and SLCO1B1 521C was significantly associated with SVA/SV ratio, which may translate into different clinical SV risk/benefit profiles.
