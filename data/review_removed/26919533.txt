HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 allele and haplotype frequencies of 8333 Chinese Han from the Zhejiang province, China.
The distribution of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) allele and haplotype is varied among different ethnic populations. In this study, HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 allele and haplotype frequencies were determined in 8333 volunteer bone marrow donors of Zhejiang Han population using the polymerase chain reaction sequence-based typing. A total of 52 HLA-A, 96 HLA-B and 61 HLA-DRB1 alleles were found. Of these, the top three frequent alleles in HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 loci, respectively, were A*11:01 (24.53%), A*24:02 (17.35%), A*02:01 (11.58%); B*40:01 (15.67%), B*46:01 (11.87%), B*58:01 (9.05%); DRB1*09:01 (17.54%),DRB1*12:02 (9.64%) and DRB1*08:03 (8.65%). A total of 171 A-B-DRB1 haplotypes with a frequency of >0.1% were presented and the five most common haplotypes were A*33:03-B*58:01- DRB1*03:01, A*02:07-B*46:01-DRB1*09:01, A*30:01-B*13:02-DRB1*07:01, A*33:03-B*58:01-RB1*13:02 and A*11:01-B*15:02-DRB1*12:02. The information will be useful for selecting unrelated bone marrow donors and for anthropology studies and pharmacogenomics analysis.
