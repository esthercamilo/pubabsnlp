A pharmacist's role in the individualization of treatment of HIV patients.
The pharmacological treatment of HIV is complex and varies considerably among patients, as does the response of patients to therapy, requiring treatment plans that are closely tailored to individual needs. Pharmacists can take an active role in individualizing care by employing their knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics and by interacting directly with patients in counseling sessions. These strategies promote the following: maintenance of plasma concentrations of antiretroviral agents within therapeutic ranges, prediction of pharmacological response of patients with certain genetic characteristics, and clinical control of HIV through the correct use of antiretroviral treatments. Together, these strategies can be used to tailor antiretroviral therapy to individual patients, thus improving treatment efficacy and safety.
