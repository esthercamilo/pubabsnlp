Glutathione S-transferase theta genotypes and environmental exposures in the risk of canine transitional cell carcinoma.
Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) in humans is associated with environmental exposures and variants in glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes. Scottish Terriers have a high breed risk for TCC, but the relationship between genetic and environmental risk in dogs is not fully understood.
