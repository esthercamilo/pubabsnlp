Institutional Profile: Jayne Haines Center for Pharmacogenomics and Drug Safety: educating future generations of healthcare professionals.
The Jayne Haines Center for Pharmacogenomics and Drug Safety operates in the Temple University School of Pharmacy and serves as an educational and research facility for professional pharmacy students, graduate students, residents, postdoctoral fellows and faculties. The Center is involved in educational and investigational projects in a setting that includes an inner city research/teaching hospital and the Temple University Schools of Pharmacy, Medicine, Dentistry and Health Professions. The mission of the Haines Center is to facilitate the basic science approach to the problems of pharmacotherapy, and to provide education for future healthcare professionals in the genetics of drug response. With the expanding role of genetic analysis in preventing adverse effects of pharmacotherapy, we are working towards truly personalized pharmacotherapy that fully exploits the advances of modern biomedical science.
