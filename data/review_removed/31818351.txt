Description of an Established, Fee-for-Service, Office-Based, Pharmacist-Managed Pharmacogenomics Practice.
<b>OBJECTIVE:</b> To describe an established, pharmacist-managed, fee-for-service, office-based pharmacogenomics (PGx) practice.<br/> <b>SETTING:</b> Multi-specialty, academic, tertiary care medical clinic and hospital.<br/> <b>PRACTICE DESCRIPTION:</b> Physician office-based PGx fee-for-service (FFS) pharmacist practice. Patients seen are complex and most are older adults.<br/> <b>INNOVATION:</b> Established service in a new area of ambulatory practice that is financially self-sustaining. Patients who received PGx testing were seen within the medication therapy management polypharmacy practice since 2015, with the PGx practice becoming official in 2018.<br/> <b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS:</b> Growth of practice, evaluated by referred patient consults ordered per month by providers.<br/> <b>RESULTS:</b> Because of insufficient third-party payment for PGx services, the practice was developed as a selfpay, FFS practice and growing because of patient and provider demand.<br/> <b>CONCLUSION:</b> It is quite possible pharmacists in greater numbers can expand PGx services into ambulatory and inpatient areas they may have never otherwise entered now that PGx has grown in use and relevance. PGx presents additional opportunities and service lines for pharmacists to practice how they were trained and assist them in collaborative integration onto the medical team.
