Pharmacogenomics and pharmacokinetics of efavirenz 400 or 600 mg in 184 treatment-naive HIV-infected patients in China.
<b>Background:</b> The pharmacogenomics and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of 400 mg efavirenz have rarely been reported. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A total of 184 treatment-naive HIV-infected patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a lower dose (tenofovir disoproxil 200 mg, efavirenz 400 mg and lamivudine) or a standard dose regimen. Relationships between pharmacogenomics and efavirenz pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics were explored at 48 weeks. <b>Results:</b> There was no relationship between pharmacogenomics and adverse reactions of the central nervous system and antiretoviral efficacy. <i>CYP2B6 516G>T</i>, <i>785A>G</i>, <i>18492C>T</i> and ABCB1 <i>3435C>T</i> T/C were associated with higher efavirenz plasma levels in the standard but not the lower dose group. No relationship was found between pharmacogenomics and antiretoviral efficacy. Patients who were <60 kg had higher efavirenz concentration compared with those with weight ≥60 kg when using 600 mg efavirenz, this was not observed with 400 mg efavirenz. <b>Conclusion:</b> The effect of pharmacogenomics and body weight on the efavirenz concentration was significant in the 600 mg group but not in the 400 mg group.
