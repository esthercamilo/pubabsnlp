Current Progress on the Influence Human Genetics Has on the Efficacy of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Used to Treat Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.
The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has become the mainstay of treatment in patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), an adult leukemia caused by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, which creates an oncogene resulting in a myeloproliferative neoplasm. These drugs function by inhibiting the ATP-binding site on the fusion oncoprotein and subsequently halting proliferative activity. The goal of this work is to investigate the current state of research into genetic factors that influence the efficacy of four FDA-approved TKIs used to treat CML. This overview attempts to identify genetic criteria that could be considered when choosing one drug over the others and to identify where more research is needed. Our results suggest that the usual liver enzymes impacting patient response may not be a major factor affecting the efficacy of imatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib, and yet, that is where most of the past research has focused. More research is warranted on the impact that human polymorphisms of the CYP enzymes have on dasatinib. The impact of polymorphisms in UGT1A1 should be investigated thoroughly in other TKIs, not only nilotinib. The role of influx and efflux transporters has been inconsistent thus far, possibly due to failures to account for the multiple proteins that can transport TKIs and the impact that tumors have on transporter expression. Because physicians cannot currently use a patient's genetic profile to better target their treatment with TKIs, it is critical that more research be conducted on auxiliary pathways or off-target binding effects to generate new leads for further study. Hopefully, new avenues of research will help explain treatment failures and improve patient outcomes.
