[Translated article] Genetic variants and enzyme activity in citidin deaminase: Relationship with capecitabine toxicity and recommendation for dose adjustment.
Capecitabine, an antineoplastic drug used in the treatment of breast and colon cancer, can cause severe, even fatal toxicity in some patients. The interindividual variability of this toxicity is largely due to genetic variations in target genes and enzymes of metabolism of this drug, such as Thymidylate Synthase (TS) and Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPD). The enzyme Cytidine Deaminase (CDA), involved in the activation of capecitabine, also has several variants associated with an increased risk of toxicity to treatment, although its role as a biomarker is not yet clearly defined. Therefore, our main objective is to study the association between the presence of genetic variants in CDA gen, CDA enzymatic activity and the development of severe toxicity in patients treated with capecitabine whose initial dose was adjusted based on the genetic profile of the DPD gen (DPYD).
