Correlates of Myopathy in Diabetic Patients Taking Statins.
Diabetes is one of the most common chronic ailments; its incidence has reached epidemic proportions in the 21st century. Diabetes significantly increases micro and macrovascular complications, which are effectively managed with statins. Therefore, statins' pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenetics have been extensively studied. Although statins act as a keystone in preventing cardiovascular complications, at the same time, they pose a threat to the quality of life of diabetics due to the resulting muscular side effects. This article summarizes the prevalence, clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and risk factors of statin-induced myopathy in diabetic patients. Among the diverse predisposing risk factors, the primary variables identified for causing myopathy in diabetic patients include age, gender, ethnicity, duration and severity of illness, comorbid conditions, level of physical activity, alcohol use, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) levels, type and dose of statins, and anti-diabetic drugs or other drugs used concomitantly. In addition, cardiovascular risk quotients also potentially impact diabetic patients making them more vulnerable to developing myopathy from statins. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of managing statin-associated myopathic side effects by providing consensus guidelines on diagnostic, monitoring, and treatment strategies. We also discussed statins' prognostic value in reducing cardiovascular events in diabetic individuals.
