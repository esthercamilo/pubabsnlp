Pregnancy and <i>CYP3A5</i> Genotype Affect Day 7 Plasma Lumefantrine Concentrations.
Pregnancy and pharmacogenetics variation alter drug disposition and treatment outcome. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of pregnancy and pharmacogenetics variation on day 7 lumefantrine (LF) plasma concentration and therapeutic responses in malaria-infected women treated with artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) in Tanzania. A total of 277 (205 pregnant and 72 nonpregnant) women with uncomplicated <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria were enrolled. Patients were treated with ALu and followed up for 28 days. <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>, and <i>ABCB1</i> genotyping were done. Day 7 plasma LF concentration and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28 were determined. The mean day 7 plasma LF concentrations were significantly lower in pregnant women than nonpregnant women [geometric mean ratio = 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) of geometric mean ratio (1.119-1.1745), <i>P</i> < 0.003]. Pregnancy, low body weight, and <i>CYP3A5*1/*1</i> genotype were significantly associated with low day 7 LF plasma concentration (<i>P</i> < 0.01). PCR-corrected ACPR was 93% (95% CI = 89.4-96.6) in pregnant women and 95.7% (95% CI = 90.7-100) in nonpregnant women. Patients with lower day 7 LF concentration had a high risk of treatment failure (mean 652 vs. 232 ng/ml, <i>P</i> < 0.001). In conclusion, pregnancy, low body weight, and <i>CYP3A5*1</i> allele are significant predictors of low day 7 LF plasma exposure. In turn, lower day 7 LF concentration is associated with a higher risk of recrudescence. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study reports a number of factors contributing to the lower day 7 lumefantrine (LF) concentration in women, which includes pregnancy, body weight, and <i>CYP3A5*1/*1</i> genotype. It also shows that day 7 LF concentration is a main predictor of malaria treatment. These findings highlight the need to look into artemether-LF dosage adjustment in pregnant women so as to be able to maintain adequate drug concentration, which is required to reduce treatment failure rates in pregnant women.
