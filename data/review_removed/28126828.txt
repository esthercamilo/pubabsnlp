CETP: Pharmacogenomics-Based Response to the CETP Inhibitor Dalcetrapib.
High-density lipoproteins are involved in reverse cholesterol transport and possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. Paradoxically, CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) inhibitors have been shown to increase inflammation as revealed by a raised plasma level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. CETP inhibitors did not improve clinical outcomes in large-scale clinical trials of unselected patients with coronary disease. Dalcetrapib is a CETP modulator for which effects on cardiovascular outcomes were demonstrated in the dal-OUTCOMES trial to be influenced by correlated polymorphisms in the <i>ADCY9</i> (adenylate cyclase type 9) gene (<i>P</i>=2.4×10<sup>-8</sup> for rs1967309). Patients with the AA genotype at rs1967309 had a relative reduction of 39% in the risk of presenting a cardiovascular event when treated with dalcetrapib compared with placebo (95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.92). In contrast, patients with the GG genotype had a 27% increase in risk, whereas heterozygotes (AG) presented a neutral result. Supporting evidence from the dal-PLAQUE-2 study using carotid ultrasonography revealed that the polymorphisms tested in the <i>ADCY9</i> linkage disequilibrium block were associated with disease regression for patients with the protective genotype, progression for the harmful genotype, and no effect in heterozygotes (<i>P</i>≤0.05 and ≤0.01 for 10 and 3 polymorphisms, respectively) when comparing dalcetrapib to placebo. Strikingly concordant and significant genotype-dependent effects of dalcetrapib were also obtained for changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and cholesterol efflux capacity. The Dal-GenE randomized trial is currently being conducted in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome bearing the AA genotype at rs1967309 in the <i>ADCY9</i> gene to confirm the effects of dalcetrapib on hard cardiovascular outcomes.
