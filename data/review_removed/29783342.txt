Are there interactions between the Gly460Trp α-adducin gene variant and the use of diuretics?
Treatment with a thiazide diuretic is associated with large interindividual differences in blood-pressure reduction. Both environmental and genetic factors might play a role. Several individual polymorphisms have already been studied for association with blood-pressure response in patients treated with diuretics. α-adducin is one of the more extensively studied polymorphisms. Unfortunately, conflicting results have been found in different populations. More research is needed to unravel the possible interactions between diuretics and the α-adducin polymorphism.
