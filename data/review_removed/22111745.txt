Safe and effective medicines for all: is personalized medicine the answer?
An improvement in drug treatment and clinical outcome is one of the major challenges in clinical medicine. The development of evidence-based standards of care has led to a significant improvement, but, by definition, strictly standardized cohorts in clinical trials have to ignore individual differences. Personalized medicine is defined as the application of genomic and molecular data to better target the delivery of healthcare, facilitate the discovery and clinical testing of new products, and help determine a person's predisposition to a particular disease or condition. After the deciphering of the human genome, however, the high expectations in individualized medicine were not always fulfilled. However, personalized medicine has become indispensable in the treatment of malignant diseases and there is increasing evidence for its benefit in other areas. This article outlines the impact of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics, especially with regard to personalized medicine, in major medical indications and reflects the obstacles and chances taken in current daily practice.
