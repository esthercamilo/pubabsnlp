Genetic variants modulate gene expression statin response in human lymphoblastoid cell lines.
Statins are widely prescribed to lower plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Though statins reduce cardiovascular disease risk overall, statin efficacy varies, and some people experience adverse side effects while on statin treatment. Statins also have pleiotropic effects not directly related to their cholesterol-lowering properties, but the mechanisms are not well understood. To identify potential genetic modulators of clinical statin response, we looked for genetic variants associated with statin-induced changes in gene expression (differential eQTLs or deQTLs) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from participants of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) 40 mg/day 6-week simvastatin clinical trial. We exposed CAP LCLs to 2 μM simvastatin or control buffer for 24 h and performed polyA-selected, strand-specific RNA-seq. Statin-induced changes in gene expression from 259 European ancestry or 153 African American ancestry LCLs were adjusted for potential confounders prior to association with genotyped and imputed genetic variants within 1 Mb of each gene's transcription start site.
