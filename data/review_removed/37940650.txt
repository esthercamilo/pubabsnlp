A software tool to adjust codeine dose based on CYP2D6 gene-pair polymorphisms and drug-drug interactions.
Codeine is metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme, and individuals with certain genetic variations of the CYP2D6 gene may metabolize codeine differently, leading to variable efficacy and toxicity. Drug-drug interactions can also affect the metabolism of codeine. A tool to adjust codeine dose based on these factors does not currently exist. Healthcare providers should use their clinical judgment and reference different established dosing guidelines to determine the appropriate dose of codeine for individual patients. The study provides a tool that assists prescribers in adjusting codeine dose based on CYP2D6 gene-pair polymorphisms and drug-drug interactions. Highlighted is the need to consider pharmacogenetics and drug-drug interactions when determining the appropriate dosing of codeine and provide a framework for implementing individualized dosing based on these factors.
