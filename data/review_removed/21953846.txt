Inhaled corticosteroid adherence in paediatric patients: the PACMAN cohort study.
Poor adherence with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) has been reported frequently and may be associated with uncontrolled asthma. A better understanding of factors influencing adherence may help to achieve higher adherence rates for a larger part of the population, which will eventually lead to better asthma control. The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with adherence in paediatric ICS users.
