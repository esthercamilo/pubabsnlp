Tailored biological treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
Psoriasis is a common, chronic immune-mediated skin disease frequently associated to inflammatory and metabolic comorbidities. About 20-30% of patients are affected by moderate-to-severe psoriasis and require a systemic treatment, which include traditional and biological drugs. The objective of this manuscript is to provide criteria for a personalized biological treatment.
