Urgent call for guidance supporting gene-based drug dosing in children and adolescents.
In the past decade, there have been tremendous advancements in the field of genomics that have led to significant progress in redefining the concept of precision medicine. Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is one of the most promising areas of precision medicine and is the 'low hanging fruit' of this individualized approach to medication dosing and selection. Although a variety of regulatory health agencies and professional consortia have established PGx clinical practice guidelines, implementation has been slow given numerous barriers faced by health care professionals. Many lack the training needed to interpret PGx and there are no paediatric specific guidelines. As the field of PGx continues to grow, an emphasis on collaborative inter-professional education, coupled with ongoing efforts to increase accessibility to advancing testing technology are necessary to translate this branch of precision medicine from the bench to the bedside.
