Analysis of schizophrenia-associated genetic markers in the HLA region as risk factors for tardive dyskinesia.
The pathology of Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) has yet to be fully understood, but there have been proposed hypotheses for the cause of this condition. Our team previously reported a possible association of TD with the Complement Component C4 gene in the HLA region. In this study, we explored the HLA region further by examining two previously identified schizophrenia-associated HLA-region single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely rs13194504 and rs210133.
