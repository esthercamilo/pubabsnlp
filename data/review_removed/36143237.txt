CNVs Associated with Different Clinical Phenotypes of Psoriasis and Anti-TNF-Induced Palmoplantar Pustulosis.
Psoriasis can present different phenotypes and could affect diverse body areas. In contrast to the high effectiveness of biological drugs in the treatment of trunk and extremities plaque psoriasis, in palmoplantar phenotypes and in plaque scalp psoriasis, these same drugs usually have reduced efficacy. Anti-TNF drugs could induce the appearance of palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) in patients with other inflammatory diseases. The objective of this study is to identify if there are DNA Copy Number Variations (CNVs) associated with these different clinical phenotypes, which could justify the differences found in clinical practice. Moreover, we intend to elucidate if anti-TNF-induced PPP has a similar genetic background to idiopathic PPP.
