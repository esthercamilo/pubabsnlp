Preliminary evidence for association of genome-wide significant DRD2 schizophrenia risk variant with clozapine response.
The recent Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association study identified an SNP, rs2514218, located 47kb upstream of the DRD2 gene to be associated with risk for schizophrenia (p = 2.75e-11). Since all antipsychotics bind to dopamine D2 receptors, we examined rs2514218 in relation to response to antipsychotic treatment.
