7TMRmine: a Web server for hierarchical mining of 7TMR proteins.
Seven-transmembrane region-containing receptors (7TMRs) play central roles in eukaryotic signal transduction. Due to their biomedical importance, thorough mining of 7TMRs from diverse genomes has been an active target of bioinformatics and pharmacogenomics research. The need for new and accurate 7TMR/GPCR prediction tools is paramount with the accelerated rate of acquisition of diverse sequence information. Currently available and often used protein classification methods (e.g., profile hidden Markov Models) are highly accurate for identifying their membership information among already known 7TMR subfamilies. However, these alignment-based methods are less effective for identifying remote similarities, e.g., identifying proteins from highly divergent or possibly new 7TMR families. In this regard, more sensitive (e.g., alignment-free) methods are needed to complement the existing protein classification methods. A better strategy would be to combine different classifiers, from more specific to more sensitive methods, to identify a broader spectrum of 7TMR protein candidates.
