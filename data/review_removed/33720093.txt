New Guidance on Cytochrome P450 2C19 Phenotype-based Use of Proton Pump Inhibitors.
Since the approval of the first proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in 1989, our knowledge regarding this class of medications has further developed. An increasing amount of data now supports the association between cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) phenotype and PPI safety and efficacy. This includes pediatric studies, such as those published here and in other pediatric journals within the past year. Moreover, the most recent pediatric Helicobacter pylori guidelines stated that using the PPIs that are less dependent on CYP2C19 for inactivation may be preferred for H pylori eradication among populations that are more likely to have rapid clearance of CYP2C19-metabolized PPIs. Conversely, pantoprazole package insert recommends a dose reduction in known pediatric CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (PMs), citing a 6-fold increase in serum concentrations compared with normal metabolizers (NMs). The purpose of this communication is to introduce a recently published Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for CYP2C19 and PPI dosing.
