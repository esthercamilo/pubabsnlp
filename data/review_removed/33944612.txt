<i>NAMPT</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1319501 and visfatin/NAMPT affect nitric oxideÂ formation, sFlt-1 and antihypertensive therapy response in preeclampsia.
<b>Aim:</b> We examined the relationships between visfatin/NAMPT and nitrite concentrations (a marker of nitric oxide [NO] formation) or sFlt-1 levels in 205 patients with preeclampsia (PE) responsive or nonresponsive to antihypertensive therapy, and whether <i>NAMPT</i> SNPs rs1319501 and rs3801266 affect nitrite concentrations in PE and 206 healthy pregnant women. <b>Patients & methods:</b> Circulating visfatin/NAMPT and sFlt-1 levels were measured by ELISA, and nitrite concentrations by using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay. <b>Results:</b> In nonresponsive PE patients, visfatin/NAMPT levels were inversely related to nitrite concentrations and positively related to sFlt-1 levels. <i>NAMPT</i> SNP rs1319501 affected nitrite concentrations in nonresponsive PE patients and was tightly linked with <i>NAMPT</i> functional SNPs in Europeans. <b>Conclusion:</b><i>NAMPT</i> SNP rs1319501 and visfatin/NAMPT affect NO formation, sFlt-1 levels and antihypertensive therapy response in PE.
