Identifying key transcription factors for pharmacogenetic studies of antipsychotics induced extrapyramidal symptoms.
We explore the transcription factors involved in the molecular mechanism of antipsychotic (AP)-induced acute extrapyramidalsymptoms (EPS) in order to identify new candidate genes for pharmacogenetic studies.
