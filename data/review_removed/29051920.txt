Personalized management of asthma exacerbations: lessons from genetic studies.

Gene-environmental interactions contribute to the complexity and heterogeneity of severe asthma and asthma exacerbations, and pharmacogenomic studies have also identified genes that affect susceptibility to asthma exacerbations.
