Influence of CYP3A5*3 and ABCB1 C3435T on clinical outcomes and trough plasma concentrations of imatinib in Nigerians with chronic myeloid leukaemia.
Imatinib mesylate is the first-line drug for the treatment of Philadelphia/bcr-abl positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). It is known to be metabolized mostly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoforms while its efflux is mediated by the transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2. Genetic polymorphism of some of these enzymes and transporters have been linked with inter-individual variations in the pharmacokinetics of the drug. This study, therefore, investigated the influence of CYP3A5*3, ABCG2 421C>A and ABCB1 3435 C>T genetic polymorphism on the clinical outcome and steady-state trough plasma concentration (TPC) of imatinib in Nigerians with CML.
