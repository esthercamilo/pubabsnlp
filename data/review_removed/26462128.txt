Systems biology approaches to adverse drug effects: the example of cardio-oncology.
Increased awareness of the cardiovascular toxic effects of chemotherapy has led to the emergence of cardio-oncology (or onco-cardiology), which focuses on screening, monitoring and treatment of patients with cardiovascular dysfunctions resulting from chemotherapy. Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, and HER2 inhibitors, such as trastuzumab, both have cardiotoxic effects. The biological rationale, mechanisms of action and cardiotoxicity profiles of these two classes of drugs, however, are completely different, suggesting that cardiotoxic effects can occur in a range of different ways. Advances in genomics and proteomics have implicated several genomic variants and biological pathways that can influence the susceptibility to cardiotoxicity from these, and other drugs. Established pathways include multidrug resistance proteins, energy utilization pathways, oxidative stress, cytoskeletal regulation and apoptosis. Gene-expression profiles that have revealed perturbed pathways have vastly increased our knowledge of the complex processes involved in crosstalk between tumours and cardiac function. Utilization of mathematical and computational modelling can complement pharmacogenomics and improve individual patient outcomes. Such endeavours should enable identification of variations in cardiotoxicity, particularly in those patients who are at risk of not recovering, even with the institution of cardioprotective therapy. The application of systems biology holds substantial potential to advance our understanding of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity.
