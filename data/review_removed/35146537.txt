Genetic variation of pharmacogenomic VIP variants in the Chinese Li population: an updated research.
Previous studies have shown that the frequency of very important pharmacogenomic (VIP) genes varies in different populations which leads to the diversities in drug efficacy, safety, and the risk associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The purpose of this study was to identify the distribution differences of VIP variants between the Li population and the other 13 populations. Based on the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase database (PhamGKB), we successfully genotyped 52 VIP variants within 27 genes in 200 unrelated Li population. Ï‡<sup>2</sup> test was used to evaluate the significant differences of genotype and allele frequencies between the Li and the other 13 populations from 1000 Genomes Project. Our study showed that the genotype frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on KCNH2, ACE, CYP4F2, and CYP2E1 were considerably different between Li and the other 13 populations, especially in rs1805123 (KCNH2), rs4291 (ACE), rs3093105 (CYP4F2), and rs6413432 (CYP2E1) loci. Meanwhile, we found several VIP variants that might alter the drug metabolism of cisplatin-cyclophosphamide (CYP2E1), vitamin E (CYP4F2), asthma amlodipine, chlorthalidone, and lisinopril (ACE) through PharmGKB. We also identified other variants which were associated with adverse effects in isoniazid and rifampicin (CYP2E1; hepatotoxicity). The four loci rs1805123 (KCNH2), rs4291 (ACE), rs3093105 (CYP4F2), and rs6413432 (CYP2E1) provided a reliable basis for the prediction of the efficacy of certain drugs. The study complemented the existed pharmacogenomics information, which could provide theoretical basis for predicting the efficacy of certain drugs in the Li population.
