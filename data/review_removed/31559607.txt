Pharmacogenetics of Atremorine-Induced Neuroprotection and Dopamine Response in Parkinson's Disease.
Atremorine is a novel bioproduct with neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons and a natural L-DOPA donor in Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, we show the effects of a single dose of Atremorine (5 g, p. o.) on plasma dopamine (DA) response and brain function in PD (n = 183) and the influence that pathogenic (<i>LRRK2</i>), metabolic (<i>CYP2D5, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, NAT2</i>), transporter (<i>ABCB1</i>), pleiotropic (<i>APOE</i>), and detoxifying genes (<i>CYP1B1, GSTT1, GSTP1, GSTM1, SOD2</i>) involved in the pharmacogenetic network exerts on Atremorine-induced DA response. Over 90% of PD patients at diagnosis show plasma DA levels below 20 pg/mL. Atremorine induces DA synthesis causing a significant increase in plasma DA levels 1 h after administration in practically 100% of patients. Females tend to show lower basal DA levels than males and the response of DA to Atremorine is stronger in males than in females. Atremorine-induced DA response is pharmacogenotype-specific and lasts from 6 - 12 h depending upon the pharmacogenetic profile of each patient. Genetic variants in pathogenic genes, metabolic genes, and genes involved in the detoxification processes affect the response of DA to Atremorine in a genotype-specific manner. Atremorine or any of its bioactive components can cross the blood-brain barrier and improve brain function and motor function, as revealed by the reduction in slow wave activity in brain mapping and psychometric assessment, respectively. Atremorine is a selective neuroprotective agent for dopaminergic neurons with prophylactic and therapeutic potential in PD.
