Comparison of linkage disequilibrium patterns and haplotype structure of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms across the CYP1A2 gene between the Korean, and other populations registered in the International HapMap database.
The aim of this study was to determine the frequencies of CYP1A2 gene polymorphisms, analyze Linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks and haplotypes in a Korean population, and compare them with those in African, European, Japanese and Chinese populations.
