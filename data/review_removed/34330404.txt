Development of a laboratory-based pharmacogenomics independent study and advanced pharmacy practice experience: Connecting basic science to clinical application.
The role of pharmacists in pharmacogenomics (PGx) use clinically is expanding, leading to increased pharmacy education requirements. Current reports indicate that PGx is primarily taught through didactic courses, indicating a need for applied coursework in pharmacy curricula, including laboratory exercises and clinical experiences. Such courses are instrumental in helping students connect the science of PGx to patient care.
