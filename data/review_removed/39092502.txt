Potential association of <i>SULT2A1</i> and <i>ABCG2</i> variant alleles with increased risk for palbociclib toxicity.
<b>Aim:</b> This study evaluated associations between <i>CYP3A4*22</i> and variants in other pharmacogenes (<i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>SULT2A1</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>ABCG2</i>, <i>ERCC1</i>) and the risk for palbociclib-associated toxicities. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Two hundred cancer patients who received standard-of-care palbociclib were genotyped and associations with toxicity were evaluated retrospectively. <b>Results:</b> No significant associations were found for <i>CYP3A4*22</i>, <i>CYP3A5*3</i>, <i>ABCB1</i>_rs1045642, <i>ABCG2</i>_rs2231142, <i>ERCC1</i>_rs3212986 and <i>ERCC1</i>_rs11615. Homozygous variant carriers of <i>SULT2A1</i>_rs182420 had higher incidence of dose modifications due to palbociclib toxicity (odds ratio [OR]: 4.334, 95% CI: 1.057-17.767, <i>p</i> = 0.042). <i>ABCG2_rs2231137</i> variant carriers had borderline higher incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia (OR: 4.14, 95% CI: 0.99-17.37, <i>p</i> = 0.052). <b>Conclusion:</b> Once validated, <i>SULT2A1</i> and <i>ABCG2</i> variants may be useful to individualize palbociclib dosing to minimize toxicities and improve treatment outcomes.
