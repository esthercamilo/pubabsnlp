Mapping the power, interest, and stance of stakeholders is a cornerstone for genomic medicine implementation. In this study, we aimed at mapping the power/interest of various stakeholders in United Arab Emirates (UAE) and exploring their attitudes toward pressing health genomics aspects. The overarching aim of this study is to facilitate the construction of a road map for the full implementation of genomic medicine and pharmacogenomics in the UAE with potential applicability to many healthcare systems around the world.
