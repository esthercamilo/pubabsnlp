Clinical pharmacogenetic analysis in 5,001 individuals with diagnostic Exome Sequencing data.
Exome sequencing is utilized in routine clinical genetic diagnosis. The technical robustness of repurposing large-scale next-generation sequencing data for pharmacogenetics has been demonstrated, supporting the implementation of preemptive pharmacogenetic strategies based on adding clinical pharmacogenetic interpretation to exomes. However, a comprehensive study analyzing all actionable pharmacogenetic alleles contained in international guidelines and applied to diagnostic exome data has not been performed. Here, we carried out a systematic analysis based on 5001 Spanish or Latin American individuals with diagnostic exome data, either Whole Exome Sequencing (80%), or the so-called Clinical Exome Sequencing (20%) (60 Mb and 17 Mb, respectively), to provide with global and gene-specific clinical pharmacogenetic utility data. 788 pharmacogenetic alleles, distributed through 19 genes included in Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines were analyzed. We established that Whole Exome and Clinical Exome Sequencing performed similarly, and 280 alleles in 11 genes (CACNA1S, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP4F2, DPYD, G6PD, NUDT15, RYR1, SLCO1B1, TPMT, and UGT1A1) could be used to inform of pharmacogenetic phenotypes that change drug prescription. Each individual carried in average 2.2 alleles and overall 95% (n = 4646) of the cohort could be informed of at least one actionable pharmacogenetic phenotype. Differences in variant allele frequency were observed among the populations studied and the corresponding gnomAD population for 7.9% of the variants. In addition, in the 11 selected genes we uncovered 197 novel variants, among which 27 were loss-of-function. In conclusion, we provide with the landscape of actionable pharmacogenetic information contained in diagnostic exomes, that can be used preemptively in the clinics.
