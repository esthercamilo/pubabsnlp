Warfarin pharmacogenetics: an illustration of the importance of studies in minority populations.
Translation of pharmacogenetics to clinical practice is increasingly common. However, most data arise in people of European ancestry, so clinical translation in non-Europeans can be challenging. Depending on the population being assessed, a polymorphismâ€™s effect can differ in magniture or be absent. Studies in minorities are therefore essential as they present opportunities for discovery that would be missed through European-only studies, and they ensure that all populations benefit from clinical pharmacogenetics.
