Pharmacogenetics of Donepezil and Memantine in Healthy Subjects.
Donepezil and memantine are the most common drugs used for Alzheimer's disease. Their low effectiveness could partly be explained by genetic factors. Thus, we aim to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the safety of donepezil and memantine. For this regard, 25 volunteers enrolled in a bioequivalence clinical trial were genotyped for 67 SNPs in 21 genes with a ThermoFisher QuantStudio 12K Flex OpenArray. The statistical strategy included a univariate analysis that analyzed the association of these SNPs with pharmacokinetic parameters or the development of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) followed by a Bonferroni-corrected multivariate regression. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software v.21 and R commander (version v3.6.3). In the univariate analysis, fourteen and sixteen SNPs showed a significant association with memantine's and donepezil's pharmacokinetic parameters, respectively. Rs20417 (<i>PTGS2</i>) was associated with the development of at least one ADR. However, none of these associations reached the significance threshold in the Bonferroni-corrected multivariate analysis. In conclusion, we did not observe any significant association of the SNPs analyzed with memantine and donepezil pharmacokinetics or ADRs. Current evidence on memantine and donepezil pharmacogenetics does not justify their inclusion in pharmacogenetic guidelines.
