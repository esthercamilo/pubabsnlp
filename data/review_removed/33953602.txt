Evaluation of <i>CYP2C19</i> Gene Polymorphisms in Patients with Acid Peptic Disorders Treated with Esomeprazole.
<i>CYP2C19</i> is a highly polymorphic gene that encodes an enzyme with the same name and whose function is associated with the metabolism of many important drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors (such as esomeprazole, which is used for the treatment of acid peptic disease). Genetic variants in <i>CYP2C19</i> alter protein function and affect drug metabolism. This study aims to genotypically and phenotypically characterize the genetic variants in the <i>CYP2C19</i> gene in 12 patients with acid peptic disorders and different therapeutic profiles to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs. The patients were randomly selected from a controlled, randomized and blinded clinical pilot trial of 33 patients. We determined the presence and frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within exons 1-5 and 9, the intron-exon junctions, and a fragment in the 3' UTR region of the <i>CYP2C19</i> gene using Sanger sequencing. Undescribed polymorphisms were analyzed by free online bioinformatics tools to evaluate the potential molecular effects of these genetic variants.
