Implications of the incidentalome for clinical pharmacogenomics.
Incidental findings have long posed challenges for healthcare providers, but the scope and scale of these challenges have increased with the introduction of new technologies. This article assesses the impact of incidental findings on the introduction of prospective pharmacogenomic testing into clinical use. Focusing on the challenges of the incidentalome, the large set of incidental findings potentially generated through genotyping, the paper argues that provisional approaches to managing incidental findings may be implemented if necessary to allow benefits of pharmacogenomic testing to be realized in the clinical setting. In the longer term, approaches to returning incidental findings may need to focus on limiting the number of incidental findings to a number that can be addressed by patients and providers.
