Variant discovery using next-generation sequencing and its future role in pharmacogenetics.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the discovery of a multitude of novel and mostly rare variants in pharmacogenes that may alter a patient's therapeutic response to drugs. In addition to single nucleotide variants, structural variation affecting the number of copies of whole genes or parts of genes can be detected. While current guidelines concerning clinical implementation mostly act upon well-documented, common single nucleotide variants to guide dosing or drug selection, <i>in silico</i> and large-scale functional assessment of rare variant effects on protein function are at the forefront of pharmacogenetic research to facilitate their clinical integration. Here, we discuss the role of NGS in variant discovery, paving the way for more comprehensive genotype-guided pharmacotherapy that can translate to improved clinical care.
