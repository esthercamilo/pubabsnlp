Effect of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 Polymorphisms on Intravenous Tacrolimus Exposure and Adverse Events in Adult Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant Patients.
Pharmacogenetics influences oral tacrolimus exposure; however, little data exist regarding i.v. tacrolimus. We investigated the impact of genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 on i.v. tacrolimus exposure and toxicity in adult patients receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for hematologic malignancies. Germline DNA was extracted from buccal swabs and genotyped for CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 polymorphisms. Continuous i.v. infusion of tacrolimus .03 mg/kg/day was initiated on day +5 post-transplant, and steady-state blood concentrations were measured 4days later. We evaluated the association between phenotypes and prevalence of nontherapeutic target concentrations (below or above 5 to 15 ng/mL) as well as tacrolimus-related toxicities. Of 63 patients, 28.6% achieved the target concentration; 71.4% were >15ng/mL, which was more common in CYP3A4 intermediate/normal metabolizers (compared with rapid) and those with at least 1 ABCB1 C2677T loss-of-function allele (P < .05). ABCB1 C2677T was significantly associated with concentrations >15ng/mL (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 23.6; P = .004) and tacrolimus-related toxicities (odds ratio, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 55.2; P = .02). ABCB1 C2677T and CYP3A4 are important determinants of i.v. tacrolimus exposure, whereas ABCB1 C2677T also impacts tacrolimus-related toxicities in stem cell transplants.
