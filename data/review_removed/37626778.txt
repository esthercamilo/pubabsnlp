Association of CYP2C9*2 Allele with Sulphonylurea-Induced Hypoglycaemia in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients: A Pharmacogenetic Study in Pakistani Pashtun Population.
Polymorphism in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 enzyme is known to cause significant inter-individual differences in drug response and occurrence of adverse drug reactions. Different alleles of the <i>CYP2C9</i> gene have been identified, but the notable alleles responsible for reduced enzyme activity are <i>CYP2C9*2</i> and <i>CYP2C9*3</i>. No pharmacogenetic data are available on <i>CYP2C9*2</i> and <i>CYP2C9*3</i> alleles in the Pakistani population. In Pakistan, pharmacogenetics, which examines the relationship between genetic factors and drug response, are in the early stages of development. We, for the first time, investigated the association between the <i>CYP2C9</i> variant alleles <i>CYP2C9*2</i> and <i>CYP2C9*3</i> and the incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving sulphonylurea medications. A total of <i>n</i> = 400 individuals of Pashtun ethnicity were recruited from 10 different districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan to participate in the study. The study participants were divided into two distinct groups: the case group (<i>n</i> = 200) and the control group (<i>n</i> = 200). The case group consisted of individuals with T2DM who were receiving sulphonylurea medications and experienced hypoglycaemia with it, whereas the control group included individuals with T2DM who were receiving sulphonylurea medication but did not experience sulphonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia (SIH). Blood samples were obtained from study participants following informed consent. DNA was isolated from whole blood samples using a Wiz-Prep DNA extraction kit. Following DNA isolation, <i>CYP2C9</i> alleles were genotyped using MassARRAY sequencing platform at the Centre of Genomics at the Rehman Medical Institute (RMI). The frequency of <i>CYP2C9*2</i> (low-activity allele) was more frequent in the diabetic patients with SIH compared to the control group (17.5% vs. 6.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.021). The frequency of its corresponding genotype <i>CYP2C9*1/*2</i> was higher in cases compared to the control group (10% vs. 6% with <i>p</i> = 0.036); the same was true for genotype <i>CYP2C9*2/*2</i> (7% vs. 3.5% with <i>p</i> = 0.028). Logistic regression analysis evidenced potential association of <i>CYP2C9*2</i> allele and its genotypes with SIH. When adjusted for confounding factors such as age, weight, sex, mean daily dose of sulphonylurea, and triglyceride level, the association between the <i>CYP2C9*2</i> allele and hypoglycaemia remained consistent. Confounding factors played no role in SIH (insignificant <i>p</i>-value) because both groups (cases and controls) were closely matched in term of age, weight, sex, mean daily dose of sulphonylurea, and triglyceride levels. Our study suggests that genetic information about a patient's <i>CYP2C9</i> gene/enzyme can potentially assist physicians in prescribing the most suitable and safest drug, based on their genetic make-up.
