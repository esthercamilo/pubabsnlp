Composite Kernel Association Test (CKAT) for SNP-set joint assessment of genotype and genotype-by-treatment interaction in Pharmacogenetics studies.
It is of substantial interest to discover novel genetic markers that influence drug response in order to develop personalized treatment strategies that maximize therapeutic efficacy and safety. To help enable such discoveries, we focus on testing the association between the cumulative effect of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a particular genomic region and a drug response of interest. However, the currently existing methods are either computational inefficient or not able to control type I error and provide decent power for whole exome or genome analysis in Pharmacogenetics (PGx) studies with small sample sizes.
