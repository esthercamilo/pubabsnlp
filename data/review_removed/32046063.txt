Precision Medicine in Non-Communicable Diseases.
The increase in life expectancy during the 20th century ranks as one of society's greatest achievements, with massive growth in the numbers and proportion of the elderly, virtually occurring in every country of the world. The burden of chronic diseases is one of the main consequences of this phenomenon, severely hampering the quality of life of elderly people and challenging the efficiency and sustainability of healthcare systems. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are considered a global emergency responsible for over 70% of deaths worldwide. NCDs are also the basis for complex and multifactorial diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The epidemics of NCDs are a consequence of a complex interaction between health, economic growth, and development. This interaction includes the individual genome, the microbiome, the metabolome, the immune status, and environmental factors such as nutritional and chemical exposure. To counteract NCDs, it is therefore essential to develop an innovative, personalized, preventative, early care model through the integration of different molecular profiles of individuals to identify both the critical biomarkers of NCD susceptibility and to discover novel therapeutic targets.
