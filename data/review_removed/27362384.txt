Advocating for the Use of Pharmacogenomics: One Nurse's Story.
The current article describes the experiences of a motivated nurse who gained an understanding of pharmacogenomics and advocated for the use cytochrome P450 testing for patients in her clinical practice, her family members, herself, and for changing the health care delivery system to more readily recognize and address drug-metabolizing-enzyme abnormalities. Recommendations for nurses interested in promoting the use of pharmacogenomics include learning as much as possible about testing and implications, networking with other providers, identifying a knowledgeable pharmacist, assessing for a family history of problems with medication side effects or lack of efficacy, and keeping records of relevant medical and medication information to share with providers.
