Immune-related gene data-based molecular subtyping related to the prognosis of breast cancer patients.
Breast cancer (BC), which is the most common malignant tumor in females, is associated with increasing morbidity and mortality. Effective treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrinotherapy and molecular-targeted therapy. With the development of molecular biology, immunology and pharmacogenomics, an increasing amount of evidence has shown that the infiltration of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment, coupled with the immune phenotype of tumor cells, will significantly affect tumor development and malignancy. Consequently, immunotherapy has become a promising treatment for BC prevention and as a modality that can influence patient prognosis.
