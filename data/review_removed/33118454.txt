Identification of rare defective allelic variants in cases of thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficient activity.
<b>Aim:</b> To assess rare <i>TPMT</i> variants in patients carrying a deficient phenotype not predicted by the four more frequent genotypes <i>(*2, *3A, *3B</i> and <i>*3C</i>). <b>Materials & methods:</b> Next-generation sequencing of <i>TPMT</i> in 39 patients with a discordant genotype. <b>Results:</b> None of the variants identified explained the discordances assuming that they are of uncertain significance according to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium classification. Two unknown variants were detected and predicted to result in a splicing defect. We show that <i>TPMT*16</i> and <i>TMPT*21</i> are defective alleles, and <i>TPMT*8</i> and <i>TPMT*24</i> are associated with a normal activity. <b>Conclusion:</b> Whole-exon sequencing for rare <i>TPMT</i> mutations has a low diagnostic yield. A reassessment of the functional impact of rare variants of uncertain significance is a critical issue.
