[Pharmacogenetics of antiretroviral therapy 2008: toward personalized treatment?].
The degree of immune restoration in HIV-1-infected patients receiving the same antiretroviral regimen and achieving sustained virologic suppression is highly variable. Equally, not all persons receiving antiretroviral drugs experience adverse effects. Consequently, there seems to be wide interindividual variability in treatment response and toxicity due to antiretroviral therapy. Recent advances in pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics have identified several host genetic determinants that modulate treatment response and toxicity with these drugs. These findings contribute to the belief that personalized design of antiretroviral drug regimens, according to the host genetic background, may be feasible in the near future.
