Pharmacogenetics of tenofovir drug transporters in the context of HBV: Is there an impact?
Current treatments for chronic hepatitis B management include orally administered nucleos(t)ide analogues, such as tenofovir (TDF), which is an acyclic adenine nucleotide analogue used both in HBV and human immune deficiency virus (HIV). The course of HBV infection is mainly dependent on viral factors, such as HBV genotypes, immunological features and host genetic variables, but a few data are available in the context of HBV, in particular for polymorphisms of genes encoding proteins involved in drug metabolism and elimination. Consequently, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential impact of genetic variants on TDF plasma and urine concentrations in patients with HBV, considering the role of HBV genotypes.
