The role of cytochrome P450 pharmacogenomics in chronic non-cancer pain patients.
Pharmacogenomics is the field that studies an individualized treatment approach for patients' medication regimen that can impact drug safety, productivity, and personalized health care. Pharmacogenomics characterizes the genetic differences in metabolic pathways which can affect a patient's individual responses to drug treatments. Areas covered: The various responses to pharmacological agents are mainly determined by the different types of genetic variants of the CYP450. CYP2D6 polymorphism is well known for its variation in the metabolism of drugs from many therapeutic arenas, including some analgesic drugs such as codeine, hydromorphone, oxycodone and tramadol. Allele combinations determine the phenotypic expression, characterized as either: extensive metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer, ultra-rapid metabolizer and poor metabolizer. Expert opinion: The Human Genome Project (HGP) revolutionized the future of medicine and the way health care providers approach individualized patient treatment, and chronic pain management is one of those areas. The key findings in the literature appear to be related to the CYP2D6 expression and its high polymorphism influencing the metabolism of opioid medications, and the impact of that on the patient's therapeutic outcome thus exemplifying the importance of genetic testing for CYP2D6 in the process of physician therapeutic decision making.
