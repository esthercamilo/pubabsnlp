Integrating pharmacogenetic testing via medication therapy management in an outpatient family medicine clinic.
<b>Introduction:</b> Pharmacogenetic (PGx) implementation has lagged behind the development of drug/gene pair guidelines. <b>Materials & methods:</b> This was a prospective study assessing the integration of PGx through medication therapy management in an outpatient clinic. Variables collected included patient diagnosis, current medications, failed or discontinued medications, PGx results/recommendations, turnaround time and pre/post clinical ratings. <b>Results:</b> A total of 91 participants completed study procedures with an average enrollment of approximately one consult per week. Participants were referred for testing primarily for guidance for current and future medications. The average number of recommendations per participant was 0.93. <b>Conclusion:</b> Integrating PGx testing into medication therapy management is feasible with PGx results available in under a week resulting in clinical recommendations in over half of patients tested.
