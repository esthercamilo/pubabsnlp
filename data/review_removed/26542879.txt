Pharmacogenomics of preterm birth prevention and treatment.
Pharmacogenomics and personalised medicine incorporate genetic factors, historical data, and environmental exposures to predict individual variation in response to medications. The study of pharmacology and pharmacogenomics is challenging in obstetrics, and our knowledge in this area lags behind other disciplines of medicine. Some preliminary data, however, suggest that some of the interindividual variation seen in response to medications given for the prevention (progesterone) and the treatment (nifedipine, terbutaline, and others) of preterm labour may be caused by pharmacogenomic effects. A comprehensive approach, integrating clinical data, environmental factors, including concomitant medications and genotype, to optimise the prevention and treatment strategies for preterm birth, is urgently needed.
