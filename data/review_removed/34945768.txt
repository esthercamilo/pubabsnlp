Documenting Pharmacogenomic Test Results in Electronic Health Records: Practical Considerations for Primary Care Teams.
With increasing patient interest in and access to pharmacogenomic testing, clinicians practicing in primary care are more likely than ever to encounter a patient seeking or presenting with pharmacogenomic test results. Gene-based prescribing recommendations are available to healthcare providers through Food and Drug Administration-approved drug labeling and Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines. Given the lifelong utility of pharmacogenomic test results to optimize pharmacotherapy for commonly prescribed medications, appropriate documentation of these results in a patient's electronic health record (EHR) is essential. The current "gold standard" for pharmacogenomics implementation includes entering pharmacogenomic test results into EHRs as discrete results with associated clinical decision support (CDS) alerts that will fire at the point of prescribing, similar to drug allergy alerts. However, such infrastructure is limited to the few institutions that have invested in the resources and personnel to develop and maintain it. For the majority of clinicians who do not practice at an institution with a dedicated clinical pharmacogenomics team and integrated pharmacogenomics CDS in the EHR, this report provides practical tips for documenting pharmacogenomic test results in the problem list and allergy field to maximize the visibility and utility of results over time, especially when such results could prevent the occurrence of serious adverse drug reactions or predict therapeutic failure.
