The pharmacogenetics of mycophenolate mofetil in Tunisian renal transplant patients.
<b>Aim:</b> The effects of variants in <i>IMPDH, UGT1A9, UGT1A8, UGT2B7</i> and <i>SLCO1B1</i> genes on the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in the Tunisian population were investigated. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A total of 245 kidney transplant patients being treated with MMF were recruited and cotreated with cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Genotyping was performed using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. MMF, cyclosporine and tacrolimus trough levels were measured by immunoassay. The AUC (AUC<sub>0-12h</sub>MPA) was estimated by a Bayesian method. <b>Results:</b> In the tacrolimus-treated group, anemia and diarrhea were associated with the <i>UGT1A9-98C</i> and <i>UGT1A9-275T</i> alleles, respectively (p < 0.05). In the cyclosporine-treated group, leukopenia was associated with the SLCO1B1-521T allele (p < 0.05). Both groups had an increased risk of rejection (p < 0.05) associated with the variant alleles of <i>IMPDH2-3757T>C</i>, <i>UGT1A9-2152C>T</i> and <i>UGT1A9-275C>A</i> and the common allele of <i>SLCO1B1-388A>G</i>. However, no significant association was found between the studied genotypes and AUC<sub>0-12h</sub>MPA or cotreatment levels. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results constitute preliminary evidence for the inclusion of the pharmacogenetics of MMF in kidney pretransplantation evaluations.
