Pharmacometabonomics, pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine.
The development of genomics in the last decade opened new perspectives to fulfill the permanent ideal of therapy, namely personalization of therapy (of medicine) by using of adage: "the right drug to the right patient". The pharmacogenomics, developed in these 10 years, already permitted the identification of the patients with side drug effects risk by detection of the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from enzymatic systems implied in drugs metabolism such as CYP450. More recently, the emergence of pharmacometabonomics permitted the appreciation of the influence of the metabolic factors (and of the environment) on the genes expression. The combination of these sciences can permit a better individualization of drug therapy concerning both the genetic background of individual and exterior interventions. Actual studies seem to confirm this supposition.
