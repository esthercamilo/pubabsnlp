Supporting pharmacogenetic-guided opioid prescriptions for post-operative pain: The design, protocol and preliminary results of the OTP study.
The interindividual variability in opioid response is an issue that contributes to the ongoing opioid crisis. Current evidence suggests this variability can be attributed to genetic factors. The pharmacogenetics of Opioid Treatment for acute post-operative Pain (OTP) project was a prospective study that aimed to identify genetic markers associated with opioid treatment outcomes. Healthy patients undergoing third-molar extractions were recruited from dental offices located within the Greater Toronto Area. Participants were evaluated using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form, the Opioid Related Symptom Distress Scale, and the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire. Seventy-two participants had an active opioid prescription. Participants were prescribed one of the following opioids: codeine, morphine, hydromorphone, tramadol, or oxycodone. The majority of participants were female (57%), ranging from 16 to 44 years of age. Pain severity, pain interference, and side effects declined over the seven-day post-operative period. Additionally, 4% of participants displayed medium to high risk of dependence. It is anticipated that OTP will enable the development of a genetic test for opioid use and facilitate the introduction of this test into routine healthcare practice. The OTP study represents a novel approach to opioid treatment and has significant implications for future interventions targeting the ongoing opioid crisis. Employing a pharmacogenomic-guided strategy for prescribing opioids may improve patients' response to this treatment and, in so doing, increase adherence to the target treatment plan. Optimized prescriptions may also provide public healthcare systems with beneficial savings and reduce the risks associated with opioid use.
