Pharmacogenomic-Based Decision Support to Predict Adherence to Medications.
Poor adherence is associated with worse disease outcomes. Pharmacogenomics provides a possible intervention to address adherence. We hypothesized that pharmacogenomic-informed care could increase adherence. Patients in a prospective case-control study underwent preemptive pharmacogenomic genotyping with results available for provider use at the point of care; controls (not genotyped) were treated by the same providers. Over 6,000 e-prescriptions for 39 medications with actionable pharmacogenomic information were analyzed. Composite adherence, measured by modified proportion of days covered (mPDC), was compared between cases/controls and genomically concordant vs. genomically higher-risk medications. Overall, 536 patients were included. No difference in mean mPDC was observed due to availability of pharmacogenomic guidance. However, case patients prescribed high-risk pharmacogenomic medications were more than twice as likely to have low mPDC for these medications compared with genomically concordant prescriptions (odds ratio = 2.4 (1.03-5.74), P < 0.05). This study is the first to show that composite pharmacogenomic information predicts adherence.
