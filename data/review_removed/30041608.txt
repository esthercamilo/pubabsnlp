Pharmacogenomic study on anti-VEGF medicine in treatment of macular Neovascular diseases: a study protocol for a prospective observational study.
Macular neovascular diseases can cause severe vision loss. A newly approved anti-VEGF drug Conbercept has shown good efficacy and safety in rigorous random controlled trials (RCT), however, it cannot fully reflect the clinical application of Conbercept in real world clinical practice. Moreover, anti-VEGF drugs are expensive and often require multiple treatments, and some patients have poor or even no response to the drugs,this resulted enormous waste of medical resources. Therefore, how to find out those patients who have good response, and how to develop individualized therapeutic regimen in real world need to be urgently investigated in the aspect of pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics.
