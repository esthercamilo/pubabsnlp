Primary osteoarthritis chondrocyte map of chromatin conformation reveals novel candidate effector genes.
Osteoarthritis is a complex disease with a huge public health burden. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of osteoarthritis-associated sequence variants, but the effector genes underpinning these signals remain largely elusive. Understanding chromosome organisation in three-dimensional (3D) space is essential for identifying long-range contacts between distant genomic features (e.g., between genes and regulatory elements), in a tissue-specific manner. Here, we generate the first whole genome chromosome conformation analysis (Hi-C) map of primary osteoarthritis chondrocytes and identify novel candidate effector genes for the disease.
