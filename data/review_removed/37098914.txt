Pharmacokinetic Model of Tenofovir and Emtricitabine and Their Intracellular Metabolites in Patients in the ANRS 134-COPHAR 3 Trial Using Dose Records.
Tenofovir (TFV) and emtricitabine (FTC) are part of the recommended highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both molecules show a large interindividual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability. Here, we modeled the concentrations of plasma TFV and FTC and their intracellular metabolites (TFV diphosphate [TFV-DP] and FTC triphosphate [FTC-TP]) collected after 4 and 24 weeks of treatment in 34 patients from the ANRS 134-COPHAR 3 trial. These patients received daily (QD) atazanavir (300 mg), ritonavir (100 mg), and a fixed-dose combination of coformulated TFV disoproxil fumarate (300 mg) and FTC (200 mg). Dosing history was collected using a medication event monitoring system. A three-compartment model with absorption delay (<i>T</i><sub>lag</sub>) was selected to describe the PK of, respectively, TFV/TFV-DP and FTC/FTC-TP. TFV and FTC apparent clearances, 114 L/h (relative standard error [RSE] = 8%) and 18.1 L/h (RSE = 5%), respectively, were found to decrease with age. However, no significant association was found with the polymorphisms <i>ABCC2</i> rs717620, <i>ABCC4</i> rs1751034, and <i>ABCB1</i> rs1045642. The model allows prediction of TFV-DP and FTC-TP concentrations at steady state with alternative regimens.
