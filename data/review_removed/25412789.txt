Pharmacogenomics and the resulting impact on psoriasis therapies.
Psoriasis is a model disease for the development of pharmacogenomic markers of treatment response, with ready access to diseased tissue and objective validated outcome measures. With the application of state-of-the-art technologies and investment in careful experimental design, the goal of stratified medicine in psoriasis may be possible. Current pharmacogenomic studies in psoriasis show excellence in many areas, including the investigation of a broad range of psoriasis therapies. To facilitate the advent of stratified medicine in psoriasis, uniformity of study design is required, with high quality, consistent phenotyping strategies for participants; definitions of outcome; and the publication of reproducible methodologies.
