Non-Random Enrichment of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Associated with Clopidogrel Resistance within Risk Loci Linked to the Severity of Underlying Cardiovascular Diseases: The Role of Admixture.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death in Puerto Rico, where clopidogrel is commonly prescribed to prevent ischemic events. Genetic contributors to both a poor clopidogrel response and the severity of CVD have been identified mainly in Europeans. However, the non-random enrichment of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with clopidogrel resistance within risk loci linked to underlying CVDs, and the role of admixture, have yet to be tested. This study aimed to assess the possible interaction between genetic biomarkers linked to CVDs and those associated with clopidogrel resistance among admixed Caribbean Hispanics. We identified 50 SNPs significantly associated with CVDs in previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs). These SNPs were combined with another ten SNPs related to clopidogrel resistance in Caribbean Hispanics. We developed Python scripts to determine whether SNPs related to CVDs are in close proximity to those associated with the clopidogrel response. The average and individual local ancestry (LAI) within each locus were inferred, and 60 random SNPs with their corresponding LAIs were generated for enrichment estimation purposes. Our results showed no CVD-linked SNPs in close proximity to those associated with the clopidogrel response among Caribbean Hispanics. Consequently, no genetic loci with a dual predictive role for the risk of CVD severity and clopidogrel resistance were found in this population. Native American ancestry was the most enriched within the risk loci linked to CVDs in this population. The non-random enrichment of disease susceptibility loci with drug-response SNPs is a new frontier in Precision Medicine that needs further attention.
