Thiopurine metabolites variations during co-treatment with aminosalicylates for inflammatory bowel disease: effect of N-acetyl transferase polymorphisms.
To evaluate variation of the concentration of thiopurine metabolites after 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) interruption and the role of genetic polymorphisms of N-acetyl transferase (NAT) 1 and 2.
