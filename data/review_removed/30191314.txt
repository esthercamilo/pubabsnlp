Multiplex analysis of genetic polymorphisms within UGT1A9, a gene involved in phase II of Î”<sup>9</sup>-THC metabolism.
We present a novel multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of 12 polymorphisms within the UGT1A9 sequence, which codes for enzymes involved in phase II biotransformation. The assay combines a multiplexed amplification step with single-base extension sequencing. The method described here is fast, cost-effective, and easy-to-use, combining the relevant features of screening methods for research and diagnostics in pharmacogenetics. To validate the assay, we tested reproducibility and sensitivity and analysed allele frequencies of 110 Caucasian individuals. Furthermore, we describe combining genetic information of individuals consuming Cannabis sativa products with respective plasma concentrations of a metabolite.
