SOD2 genetic polymorphism (rs4880) has no impact on 6-month response to antidepressant treatment and inflammatory biomarkers in depressed patients.
Two thirds of patients suffering from a major depressive episode (MDE) do not reach a complete response with antidepressant drugs. This lack of response is due to several factors, including genetic determinants. Since major depressive disorder is associated with inflammatory and oxidative stress abnormalities, the metabolism of superoxide anions might be involved in non-response to antidepressant drugs. Superoxide anions are metabolized by manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in the mitochondria. A functional genetic polymorphism (SOD2, rs4880), responsible of a 40% reduction in enzyme activity, is associated with anti-inflammatory response of rosuvastatin. We investigated the association of ala-allele of SOD2 rs4880 and both antidepressant efficacy and inflammatory parameters in patients treated for a MDE with antidepressant drugs. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score and levels of plasma CRP and inflammatory cytokines were assessed at baseline, one month (M1), 3 months (M3) and 6 months (M6) after antidepressant treatment. They were compared according to SOD2 genetic polymorphism. Of the 484 patients studied, 361 (74.6%) carried the ala-allele (Ala group), 123 (25.4%) of them had Val/Val genotype (Val/Val group). No significant difference was observed between the Ala and Val/Val groups neither for baseline clinical characteristics, nor for HDRS scores, response/remission rates, plasma CRP and cytokine levels throughout the study. The rs4880 SOD2 genetic polymorphism was not associated with the clinical response and cytokines levels after antidepressant treatment. These data suggest that SOD2 is not a major genetic determinant of antidepressant response. Other genes of the oxidative stress pathways should be explored in further studies.
