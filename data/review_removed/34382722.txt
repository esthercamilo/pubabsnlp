Profiling of warfarin pharmacokinetics-associated genetic variants: Black Africans portray unique genetic markers important for an African specific warfarin pharmacogenetics-dosing algorithm.
Warfarin dose variability observed in patients is attributed to variation in genes involved in the warfarin metabolic pathway. Genetic variation in CYP2C9 and VKORC1Â has been the traditional focus in evaluating warfarin dose variability, with little focus on other genes.
