Gene-based approaches in pain research and exploration of new therapeutic targets and strategies.
Large panel of gene-based techniques is used for many years specifically in the pain research field. From the first identification (cloning) of some "mythic" genes, such as those encoding opioid or capsaicin receptors allowing then the creation of first-generation knockout mice, to the today conditional (time, tissue, cell-type and even pathology-dependent) and regulatable modulation of a gene function, these approaches largely contributed to fundamental leaps forward in our understanding of the function of some proteins and of their interest as possible druggable targets. Perhaps one of the most remarkable evolution in the last years is the passage of these approaches from the bench to the patient; whether it concerns the identification of genes involved in inherited pain insensibility/susceptibility, the search for genetic markers of pain types, the individual pharmacogenomics or even the first gene therapy trials. From many possible variants of gene-grounded techniques used in pain research we focus here on gene knockouts and some recent developments, on viral vectors-based gene transfer and on transgenic models for the tracing of pain pathways. Through these selected examples we attempted to emphasize the immense potential of these approaches and their already well-recognized contribution in both the basic and clinical pain research.
