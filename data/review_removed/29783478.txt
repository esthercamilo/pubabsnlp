Personalized medicine: importance of clinical interpretative skills for real-world patient care.
Sequencing of the human genome led to great hopes and expectations for a 'genomics revolution' where disease diagnosis as well as therapies would be based on an individual's genetic makeup. Although significant progress has been made, a number of challenging hurdles must be overcome prior to the broader adoption and implementation of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine as a part of standard patient care. One aspect of pharmacogenomics-based personalized medicine that has not garnered as much attention, a key focus of this perspective, is the importance of interpreting pharmacogenomic test results in a patient-specific clinical context, and expert physicians and other allied health care providers with the requisite expertise in clinical pharmacology and genomics who are able to provide such services.
