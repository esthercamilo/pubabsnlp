Early human screening of medications to treat drug addiction: novel paradigms and the relevance of pharmacogenetics.
Initial screening of medications for efficacy in treating drug dependence may be accomplished more efficiently by using novel approaches that combine the practical advantages of within-subject laboratory studies with the clinical validity provided by clinical trials. <i>A priori</i> selection of functional gene variants associated with the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic effects of a medication may aid this effort by controlling for individual variability as to clinical response or adverse effects; however, there are limitations to this approach, and these should be carefully considered.
