Application of a Pharmacogenetics-Based Precision Medicine Model (5SPM) to Psychotic Patients That Presented Poor Response to Neuroleptic Therapy.
Antipsychotics are the keystone of the treatment of severe and prolonged mental disorders. However, there are many risks associated with these drugs and not all patients undergo full therapeutic profit from them. The application of the 5 Step Precision Medicine model(5SPM), based on the analysis of the pharmacogenetic profile of each patient, could be a helpful tool to solve many of the problematics traditionally associated with the neuroleptic treatment. In order to solve this question, a cohort of psychotic patients that showed poor clinical evolution was analyzed. After evaluating the relationship between the prescribed treatment and pharmacogenetic profile of each patient, a great number of pharmacological interactions and pharmacogenetical conflicts were found. After reconsidering the treatment of the conflictive cases, patients showed a substantial reduction on mean daily doses and polytherapy cases, which may cause less risk of adverse effects, greater adherence, and a reduction on economic costs.
