Pharmacologic treatments for pulmonary hypertension: exploring pharmacogenomics.
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease with multiple etiologies and is categorized into five broad groups. Of these groups, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is the most studied and, therefore, all of the currently available drug classes (prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors) were developed to treat PAH. Thus, limited treatment data exist for the less-studied non-PAH forms of PH. Pharmacogenomics can be a tool to better understand the pathways involved in PH, as well as to improve personalization of therapy. However, little pharmacogenomic research has been carried out on this disease. New treatments for PH are on the horizon, deriving from both repurposed currently available drugs and novel therapeutics.
