Association between SNPs of Metalloproteinases and Prostaglandin F2α Receptor Genes and Latanoprost Response in Open-Angle Glaucoma.
To determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes coding for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the prostaglandin F2α receptor gene (PTGFR) are related to a response to latanoprost in a white Spanish population of glaucomatous patients.
