PGxO and PGxLOD: a reconciliation of pharmacogenomic knowledge of various provenances, enabling further comparison.
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) studies how genomic variations impact variations in drug response phenotypes. Knowledge in pharmacogenomics is typically composed of units that have the form of ternary relationships gene variant - drug - adverse event. Such a relationship states that an adverse event may occur for patients having the specified gene variant and being exposed to the specified drug. State-of-the-art knowledge in PGx is mainly available in reference databases such as PharmGKB and reported in scientific biomedical literature. But, PGx knowledge can also be discovered from clinical data, such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and in this case, may either correspond to new knowledge or confirm state-of-the-art knowledge that lacks "clinical counterpart" or validation. For this reason, there is a need for automatic comparison of knowledge units from distinct sources.
