Pharmacogenetic Study of the Impact of <i>ABCB1</i> Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms on the Response to Cyclosporine in Psoriasis Patients.
Psoriasis is a chronic, T cell-mediated skin disease affecting 2-3% of the Caucasian population. Cyclosporine A is a calcineurin inhibitor that acts selectively on T cells. The cyclosporine A treatment response has been suggested to be modulated by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the <i>ABCB1</i> gene. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of <i>ABCB1</i> genetic variants that could affect the response to a cyclosporine treatment in Russian psoriasis patients with the <i>ABCB1</i> genotype status. The <i>ABCB1</i> T-129C, G1199A, C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T SNPs in the 168 patients with psoriasis were genotyped by PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism) and TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. The <i>ABCB1</i> C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T SNPs were significantly associated with a negative response to cyclosporine therapy. A very strong association was evident for the C3435T SNP in the <i>ABCB1</i> gene in the allele, dominant and recessive models (OR = 2.58, OR = 4.01, OR = 2.50, respectively). <i>ABCB1</i> C1236T and G2677T/A polymorphisms were significantly associated with a negative response to the cyclosporine therapy in the codominant, dominant and recessive models (<i>p</i> ˂ 0.05). Additionally, the haplotype analysis identified that the TGC haplotype is significantly associated with a negative response to cyclosporine therapy in psoriasis patients (<i>p</i> ˂ 0.05). The current study to the best of our knowledge is the first of its kind to be performed in the Russian population. In conclusion, the present results suggest an association between the <i>ABCB1</i> genetic variants and unresponsiveness to cyclosporine in the Russian population. Further, larger studies are necessary to confirm our findings and replicate them in various ethnic populations before its implementation in the clinical practice.
