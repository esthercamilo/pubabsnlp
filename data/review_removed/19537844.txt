Diagnostic microarrays in hematologic oncology: applications of high- and low-density arrays.
Microarrays have become important tools for high-throughput analysis of gene expression, chromosome aberrations, and gene mutations in cancer cells. In addition to high-density experimental microarrays, low-density, gel-based biochip technology represents a versatile platform for translation of research into clinical practice. Gel-based microarrays (biochips) consist of nanoliter gel drops on a hydrophobic surface with different immobilized biopolymers (primarily nucleic acids and proteins). Because of the high immobilization capacity of the gel, such biochips have a high probe concentration and high levels of fluorescence signals after hybridization, which allow the use of simple, portable detection systems. The notable accuracy of the analysis is reached as a result of the high level of discrimination between positive and negative gel-bound probes. Different applications of biochips in the field of hematologic oncology include analysis of chromosomal translocations in leukemias, diagnostics of T-cell lymphomas, and pharmacogenetics.
