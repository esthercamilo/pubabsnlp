Effect of Tacrolimus Formulation (Prolonged-Release vs Immediate-Release) on Its Susceptibility to Drug-Drug Interactions with St. John's Wort.
Tacrolimus is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and is susceptible to interactions with the CYP3A and P-glycoprotein inducer St. John's Wort (SJW). CYP3A isozymes are predominantly expressed in the small intestine and liver. Prolonged-release tacrolimus (PR-Tac) is largely absorbed in distal intestinal segments and is less susceptible to CYP3A inhibition. The effect of induction by SJW is unknown. In this randomized, crossover trial, 18 healthy volunteers received single oral tacrolimus doses (immediate-release [IR]-Tac or PR-Tac, 5Â mg each) alone and during induction by SJW. Concentrations were quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and non-compartmental pharmacokinetics were evaluated. SJW decreased IR-Tac exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) to 73% (95% confidence interval 60%-88%) and maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub> ) to 61% (52%-73%), and PR-Tac exposure to 67% (55%-81%) and C<sub>max</sub> to 69% (58%-82%), with no statistical difference between the 2 formulations. The extent of interaction appeared to be less pronounced in volunteers with higher baseline CYP3A4 activity and in CYP3A5 expressors. In contrast to CYP3A inhibition, CYP3A induction by SJW showed a similar extent of interaction with both tacrolimus formulations. A higher metabolic baseline capacity appeared to attenuate the extent of induction by SJW.
