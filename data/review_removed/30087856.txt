A Novel <i>DPYD</i> Variant Associated With Severe Toxicity of Fluoropyrimidines: Role of Pre-emptive <i>DPYD</i> Genotype Screening.
<b>Background:</b> The fluoropyrimidine anticancer drug, especially 5- fluorouracil (5-FU) and its prodrug capecitabine are still being the backbone of chemotherapeutic regimens for colorectal cancer. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the crucial enzyme in the catabolism of 5-FU. Over the past 30 years, there is substantial clinical evidence showing that DPD deficiency is strongly associated with severe and fatal fluoropyrimidine-induced toxicity. <b>Patients and methods:</b> A 49-year-old lady with resected stage III carcinoma of sigmoid colon was scheduled to have a course of 5-FU based adjuvant chemotherapy. She developed unexpected acute severe (grade 4) toxicity after the first cycle of chemotherapy. Genomic DNA was isolated from 3 ml peripheral blood cells for full sequencing of <b><i>DPYD</i></b> (the gene encoding DPD). <b>Results:</b> Exome sequencing confirmed that she is heterozygous for NM_000110.3: c.321+2T>C of the <b><i>DPYD</i></b> gene. To the best of our knowledge, this variant is a novel pathogenic splicing variant of the <b><i>DPYD</i></b> gene resulting in a non-functional allele. As she has a heterozygous genotype and considered having decreased DPD activity, we followed the international recommendation and restart chemotherapy with at least 50% reduction for 5-FU dose. We then titrated the 5-FU dose, and she tolerated the subsequent cycles of chemotherapy and completed the whole course of adjuvant chemotherapy. <b>Conclusions:</b> With a pre-emptive test on DPD deficiency before the administration of the fluoropyrimidine drugs, the aforementioned patient's life-threatening event could be avoided. This clinical utility has been confirmed by two recent large-scale studies and called for a drug label update.
