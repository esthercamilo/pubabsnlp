The need to improve current psychopharmacotherapy before developing new drugs.
CNS research has become unprofitable, and several pharmaceutical companies have reduced financial support for developing new CNS drugs. Until the situation can be changed, it is our duty to optimize the usage of the currently available psychoactive drugs. Several tools for optimizing pharmacotherapy are available, such as therapeutic drug monitoring and genotyping and phenotyping CYP enzymes. Further medical treatment and healthcare provision for patients with severe mental disorders should be improved. Knowledge of psychopharmacotherapy influences the choices of medication and outcomes; therefore, future psychiatrists should have a greater knowledge of pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics.
