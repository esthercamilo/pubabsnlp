Ultrarapid clozapine metabolism and CYP2D6 gene duplication in a patient with schizophrenia.
An optimal clozapine serum level is required for both optimization of clinical response and minimization of troublesome or some of the life-threatening side effects. Serum levels can be influenced by comedication that can cause phenoconversion. When norclozapine/clozapine serum levels and ratios are consistently and significantly lower/higher than expected and there are no concomitant drugs that could account for these findings, further investigation of the genetic variants of CYP1A2, 2D6 and 3A4 are warranted.
