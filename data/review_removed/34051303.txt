Clinical pharmacology and drug-drug interactions of lenvatinib in thyroid cancer.
Lenvatinib is a non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with high in vitro potency against vascular endothelial growth factor receptors. Although this drug is used to treat several cancer types, it is the most effective TKI used in patients with thyroid cancer. Lenvatinib is well tolerated and the most common adverse drug reactions can be adequately managed by dose adjustment. Particularly, blood pressure and cardiac function monitoring, as well as antihypertensive treatment optimization, may be required in patients treated with lenvatinib. Dose reduction should be taken into account in patients with body weight <60 kg or severe hepatic failure. No significant change in lenvatinib pharmacokinetics has been observed with other patient-related factors and very few data are available on lenvatinib pharmacogenetics. Lenvatinib can be administered orally regardless of food and no clinically relevant drug-drug interactions have been reported.
