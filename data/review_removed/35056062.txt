Genotyping for HLA Risk Alleles to Prevent Drug Hypersensitivity Reactions: Impact Analysis.
Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) variants can be a risk factor for developing potentially fatal drug hypersensitivity reactions. Our aim was to estimate the potential impact of genotyping for the HLA risk alleles incorporated in the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) guidelines in The Netherlands. We estimated the number of hypersensitivity reactions and associated deaths that can be avoided annually by genotyping for these HLA risk alleles. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness was estimated. Nationwide implementation of genotyping HLA risk alleles before initiating drugs with an actionable drug-gene interaction can potentially save the life of seven allopurinol initiators and two flucloxacillin initiators each year in The Netherlands. Besides these deaths, 28 cases of abacavir hypersensitivity, 24 cases of allopurinol induced SCARs, 6 cases of carbamazepine induced DRESS and 22 cases of flucloxacillin induced DILI can be prevented. Genotyping <i>HLA-B*5701</i> in abacavir initiators has a number needed to genotype of 31 to prevent one case of abacavir hypersensitivity and is cost-saving. Genotyping <i>HLA-B*5801</i> in allopurinol initiators has a number needed to genotype of 1149 to prevent one case of SCAR but is still cost-effective. Genotyping before initiating antiepileptic drugs or flucloxacillin is not cost-effective. Our results confirm the need for mandatory testing of <i>HLA-B*5701</i> in abacavir initiators, as indicated in the drug label, and show genotyping of <i>HLA-B*</i>5801 in allopurinol initiators should be considered.
