Gene polymorphism-related differences in the outcomes of abiraterone for prostate cancer: a systematic overview.
Numerous prostate cancer (PC) associated genes have been reported in previous genome-wide association studies. Elucidation of prostate cancer pharmacogenomics have enhanced studies into the impact of germline genetic changes on treatment, in addition to evaluating related genomic alterations and biomarkers in prostate tumor tissues. Currently, Abiraterone (Abi) is used as one of the therapeutic options for PC. In this article, germline variants that have been associated with responses to Abi in patients with advanced PC are summarized. These include biomarker genes such as <i>CYP17A1, AR-V7, HSD3B1, SLCO2B1, SULT1E1,</i> and <i>SRD5A2</i> that are involved in homologous recombination, as well as in gene expression mutations in important signaling pathways, such as WNT and Abi metabolic pathways.
