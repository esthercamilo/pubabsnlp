Cardiometabolic genomics and pharmacogenomics investigations in Filipino Americans: Steps towards precision health and reducing health disparities.
Filipino Americans (FAs) are the third-largest Asian American subgroup in the United States (US). Some studies showed that FAs experience more cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) than other Asian subgroups and non-Hispanic Whites. The increased prevalence of CMD observed in FAs could be due to genetics and social/dietary lifestyles. While FAs are ascribed as an Asian group, they have higher burdens of CMD, and adverse social determinants of health compared to other Asian subgroups. Therefore, studies to elucidate how FAs might develop CMD and respond to medications used to manage CMD are warranted. The ultimate goals of this study are to identify potential mechanisms for reducing CMD burden in FAs and to optimize therapeutic drug selection. Collectively, these investigations could reduce the cardiovascular health disparities among FAs.
