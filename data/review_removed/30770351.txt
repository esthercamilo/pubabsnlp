PDK1 Mediates <i>NOTCH1</i>-Mutated Head and Neck Squamous Carcinoma Vulnerability to Therapeutic PI3K/mTOR Inhibition.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is driven largely by the loss of tumor suppressor genes, including <i>NOTCH1</i>, but lacks a biomarker-driven targeted therapy. Although the PI3K/mTOR pathway is frequently altered in HNSCC, the disease has modest clinical response rates to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and lacks validated biomarkers of response. We tested the hypothesis that an unbiased pharmacogenomics approach to PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors would identify novel, clinically relevant molecular vulnerabilities in HNSCC with loss of tumor suppressor function.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We assessed the degree to which responses to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are associated with gene mutations in 59 HNSCC cell lines. Apoptosis in drug-sensitive cell lines was confirmed <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. NOTCH1 pathway components and PDK1 were manipulated with drugs, gene editing, knockdown, and overexpression.
