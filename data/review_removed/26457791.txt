Clinical pharmacy service practice in a Chinese tertiary hospital.
Clinical pharmacy service is focused on the rationality and safety of medication therapy. Clinical pharmacists play an important role in designing therapeutic regimen, preventing medication errors, reducing the incidence of adverse drug reaction, and saving medical costs. Although clinical pharmacy service in China is in its early stage, its development is rapid. In this manuscript, the working model of clinical pharmacists in a Chinese tertiary hospital is introduced, including ward rounds, consultation, stewardship of antimicrobial therapy, drug adverse reaction monitoring, therapeutic drug monitoring, clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics, and training system. With the efforts of clinical pharmacists, there will be a significant increase in the optimization of medication therapy and a notable reduction in preventable adverse drug events as well as health-care cost in China.
