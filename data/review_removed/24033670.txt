CYP2D6 variation, behaviour and psychopathology: implications for pharmacogenomics-guided clinical trials.
Individual and population differences in polymorphic cytochrome P450 enzyme function have been known for decades. The biological significance of these differences has now been deciphered with regard to drug metabolism, action and toxicity as well as disposition of endogenous substrates, including neuroactive compounds. While the cytochrome P450 enzymes occur abundantly in the liver, they are expressed in most tissues of the body, albeit in varying amounts, including the brain. The latter location of cytochrome P450s is highly pertinent for susceptibility to neuropsychiatric diseases, not to mention local drug metabolism at the site of psychotropic drug action in the brain. In the current era of personality medicine with companion theranostics (i.e. the fusion of therapeutics with diagnostics), this article underscores that such versatile biological roles of cytochrome P450s offer multiple points of entry for personalized medicine and rational therapeutics. We focus our discussion on CYP2D6, one of the most intensively researched drug and endogenous compound metabolism pathways, with a view to relevance for, and optimization of, pharmacogenomic-guided clinical trials. Working on the premise that CYP2D6 is related to human behaviour and certain personality traits such as serotonin and dopamine system function, we further suggest that the motivation of healthy volunteers to participate in clinical trials may in part be influenced by an under- or over-representation of certain CYP2D6 metabolic groups.
