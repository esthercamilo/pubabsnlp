The influence of CYP2C19*2 and CYP3A5*3 variants on the development of depression and effectiveness of therapy: A preliminary study.
The most common mental illness is depression; however, its pathogenesis is not fully understood. One of the factors that may influence its development and the effectiveness of therapy are the cytochromes of the p450 complex. CYP3A5 and CYP2C19 are involved in the metabolism of drugs used in the treatment of depression. These cytochromes can also generate reactive oxygen species, which are known to participate in the pathogenesis of depression. The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of CYP3A5*3 and CYP2C19*2 variants among a group of patients with depression to identify any potential association with disease development and progression, and the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy. A group of 103 patients suffering from recurrent depressive disorder and another of 93 healthy individuals were investigated using RFLP. It was found that the CYP3A5*3 allele may have a protective role in the development of depression (p = 0.0036). Heterozygous CYP3A5*1/*3 was more common in controls than the patients (p = 0.0300). Homozygotes were associated with an earlier onset than heterozygotes (p = 0.0292). For CYP2C19, patients with at least one CYP2C19*2 allele revealed better treatment results expressed as percentage change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (p = 0.0239). The identification of CYP3A5 and CYP2C19 allelic variants may be useful when assessing the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy.
