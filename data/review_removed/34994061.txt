Metabolovigilance: Associating Drug Metabolites with Adverse Drug Reactions.
The Metabolovigilance database (https://pharmacogenomics.clas.ucdenver.edu/pharmacogenomics/side-effect/) is a single repository of information on over 15,920 pharmaceuticals and the compounds expected to result from metabolism of these drugs. Metabolovigilance functions as both a web server, providing data directly to users and as a web application, applying user inputs to create logic statements that curate the data presented or downloaded. Using this tool, it is easy to collect information on drugs, their side effects, and the metabolites associated with specific side effects. Information on these compounds can be sorted based on physical properties of the drugs and their metabolites. All of this information can be viewed, sorted, and downloaded for use in other applications. This open-access tool will facilitate molecular studies on the causes of adverse drug reactions and is well suited to integrate with genomic data furthering the goals of personalized medicine.
