The future of warfarin pharmacogenetics in under-represented minority groups.
Genotype-based dosing recommendations are provided in the US FDA-approved warfarin labeling. However, data that informed these recommendations were from predominately Caucasian populations. Studies show that variants contributing to warfarin dose requirements in Caucasians provide similar contributions to dose requirements in US Hispanics, but significantly lesser contributions in African-Americans. Further data demonstrate that variants occurring commonly in individuals of African ancestry, but rarely in other racial groups, significantly influence dose requirements in African-Americans. These data suggest that it is important to consider variants specific for African-Americans when implementing genotype-guided warfarin dosing in this population.
