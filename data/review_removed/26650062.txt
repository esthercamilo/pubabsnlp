Advances in the Pharmacogenomics of Adverse Drug Reactions.
Rapid developments in pharmacogenomics have been noticeable in recent years, and much of this knowledge has improved understanding of adverse drug reactions. This improved knowledge has largely been the result of improved sequencing technologies and falling costs in this area, as well as improved statistical techniques to analyse the data derived from studies. While the genetic reasons behind adverse drug reactions are becoming better understood, translation of this knowledge, particularly in terms of biomarkers that might be clinically applicable at the bedside, has been more difficult. Understanding of the technologies and their application is limited among practising clinicians. The cost of some of the technologies available may also be prohibitive in stretched healthcare economies. As education about the potential for applying pharmacogenomics improves and costs fall, understanding of adverse drug reactions and application of this knowledge in a clinical setting should improve.
