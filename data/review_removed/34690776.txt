Pharmacogenomics Factors Influencing the Effect of Risperidone on Prolactin Levels in Thai Pediatric Patients With Autism Spectrum Disorder.
We investigated the association between genetic variations in pharmacodynamic genes and risperidone-induced increased prolactin levels in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In a retrospective study, variants of pharmacodynamic genes were analyzed in 124 ASD patients treated with a risperidone regimen for at least 3 months. To simplify genotype interpretation, we created an algorithm to calculate the dopamine D2 receptor (<i>DRD2</i>) gene genetic risk score. There was no relationship between prolactin levels and single SNPs. However, the H1/H3 diplotype (A2/A2-Cin/Cin-A/G) of <i>DRD2</i>/ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (<i>ANKK1</i>) <i>Taq</i>1A, <i>DRD2</i> -141C indel, and <i>DRD2</i> -141A>G, which had a genetic risk score of 5.5, was associated with the highest median prolactin levels (23 ng/ml). As the dose-corrected plasma levels of risperidone, 9-OH-risperidone, and the active moiety increased, prolactin levels in patients carrying the H1/H3 diplotype were significantly higher than those of the other diplotypes. <i>DRD2</i> diplotypes showed significantly high prolactin levels as plasma risperidone levels increased. Lower levels of prolactin were detected in patients who responded to risperidone. This is the first system for describing <i>DRD2</i> haplotypes using genetic risk scores based on their protein expression. Clinicians should consider using pharmacogenetic-based decision-making in clinical practice to prevent prolactin increase.
