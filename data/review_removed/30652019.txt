Identifying genetic markers associated with susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases.
The development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is due to a complex interaction between the genome and the environment. Understanding how genetic differences in individuals contribute to their susceptibility to CVDs can help guide practitioners to give the best advice to achieve a favorable outcome for the patient. As genome technologies evolve, genotyping of individuals could be available to all patients using a simple saliva test. Large-scale genome-wide association studies and meta analyses have provided powerful insights into polymorphisms that may be predictive of disease and an individual's response to certain nutrients, but moving forward it is imperative that these insights can be applied in the medical setting to reduce the incidence and mortality of CVDs.
