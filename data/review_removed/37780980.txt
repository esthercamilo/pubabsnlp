Cancer awareness, diagnosis and treatment needs in Mizoram, India: evidence from 18 years trends (2003-2020).
Despite being the second least populated state, Mizoram exhibits the highest incidence rate of cancer in India. Its inhabitants, constituting an endogamous and isolated population, have embraced their own distinct culture, way of life and dietary preferences, setting them apart from the rest of mainland India. In 2003, the Mizoram Population Based Cancer Registry (PBCR) was established under the auspices of the National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR), a division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in collaboration with the Department of Health & Family Welfare of the Government of Mizoram, India.
