Effects of <i>SLCO1B1</i> polymorphisms on plasma estrogen concentrations in women with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitors exemestane and letrozole.
<b>Aim:</b> This study tested for associations between <i>SLCO1B1</i> polymorphisms and circulating estrogen levels in women with breast cancer treated with letrozole or exemestane. <b>Patients & methods:</b> Postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive breast cancer were genotyped for <i>SLCO1B1*5</i> (rs4149056) and rs10841753. Pretreatment and on-treatment plasma estrogens and aromatase inhibitor (AI) concentrations were measured. Regression analyses were performed to test for pharmacogenetic associations with estrogens and drug concentrations. <b>Results:</b><i>SLCO1B1*5</i> was associated with elevated pretreatment estrone sulfate and an increased risk of detectable estrone concentrations after 3Â months of AI treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggest <i>SLCO1B1</i> polymorphisms may have an effect on estrogenic response to AI treatment, and therefore may adversely impact the anticancer effectiveness of these agents.
