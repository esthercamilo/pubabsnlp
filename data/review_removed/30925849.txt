Pharmacogenomics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous condition, which presents the opportunity for precision therapy based on genetics or other biomarkers. Areas covered: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic form of emphysema, provides an example of this precision approach to diagnosis and therapy. To date, research in COPD pharmacogenomics has been limited by small sample sizes, lack of accessible target tissue, failure to consider COPD subtypes, and different outcomes relevant for various medications. There have been several published genome-wide association studies and other omics studies in COPD pharmacogenomics; however, clinical implementation remains far away. There is a growing evidence base for precision prescription of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD, based on clinical phenotypes and blood biomarkers, but not yet based on pharmacogenomics. Expert opinion: At this time, there is insufficient evidence for clinical implementation of COPD pharmacogenomics. Additional genome-wide studies will be required to discover predictors of drug response and to identify genomic biomarkers of COPD subtypes, which could be targeted with subtype-directed therapies.
