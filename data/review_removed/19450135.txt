Novel multistranded, alternative, plasmid and helical transitional DNA and RNA microarrays: implications for therapeutics.
Novel multistranded and alternative DNA, RNA and plasmid microarrays (transitional structural nucleic acid microarrays) have been developed that allows for the immobilization of intact, nondenatured, double-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA, and alternative and multistranded nucleic acids. It also allows for the study of transitional changes that occur in the structure of DNA and RNA. Alternative types of DNA, RNA and multistranded nucleic acids are immobilized by a variety of different surface chemistries (i.e., noncovalent or covalent) onto a novel substrate surface. This technology represents the next generation of microarrays, which will aid in the characterization of nucleic acid structure and function, and accelerate the discovery of drugs that bind to nucleic acids. In addition, we demonstrate four novel techniques that are the first practical applications of the microarray, that is, transitional structural chemogenomics, transitional structural chemoproteomics, transitional structural pharmacogenomics and transitional structural pharmacoproteomics. These novel nucleic acid microarrays, together with pharmacogenomics, can be used to improve the study of DNA and RNA structure, gene expression, drug development and treatment of various diseases.
