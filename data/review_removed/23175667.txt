Increased hospital stay and allograft dysfunction in renal transplant recipients with Cyp2c19 AA variant in SNP rs4244285.
Pharmacogenetics correlates certain genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with blood drug levels, efficacy, and adverse effects of the treatment. Tacrolimus is mainly metabolized via CYP3A4/5, whereas CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 are responsible for omeprazole metabolism. Omeprazole inhibits tacrolimus metabolism via CYP3A5 in patients carrying variant alleles of CYP2C19, increasing tacrolimus blood concentrations. Seventy-five renal transplant recipients treated with tacrolimus and concomitant omeprazole were genotyped in a panel of 37 SNPs with use of Sequenom MassArray. The patients with CYP2C19*2/*2 genotype (n = 4) showed a median posttransplantation hospital stay of 27.5 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 23-39 days), compared with 12 days (95% CI, 10-15 days) in patients with CYP2C19*1/*1 or CYP2C19*1/*2 (n = 71; P = 0.016, Kruskal-Wallis test).The difference in hospital stay was directly correlated with an increase in tacrolimus levels (C(min)/[dose/weight]) during the first week after trasplantation (in 59 patients with data on levels; P = 0.021, Kruskal-Wallis), excluding the patients with atypical metabolisms due to CYP3A5*1/*3 or CYP3A5*1/*1 genotype. Recipients with CYP2C19*2/*2 genotype also showed allograft delayed function (acute tubular necrosis in 3 patients). Genotyping of CYP3A5 and CYP2C19 in renal transplantation should be considered to be of interest when treating with tacrolimus and omeprazole, because CYP2C19*2/*2 variant indirectly elicits an increase of tacrolimus blood levels and, in our study population, the adverse effects described.
