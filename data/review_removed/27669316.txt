OSAnalyzer: A Bioinformatics Tool for the Analysis of Gene Polymorphisms Enriched with Clinical Outcomes.
The identification of biomarkers for the estimation of cancer patients' survival is a crucial problem in modern oncology. Recently, the Affymetrix DMET (Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) microarray platform has offered the possibility to determine the ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) gene variants of a patient and to correlate them with drug-dependent adverse events. Therefore, the analysis of survival distribution of patients starting from their profile obtained using DMET data may reveal important information to clinicians about possible correlations among drug response, survival rate, and gene variants.
