Pharmacogenetics of ABC and SLC transporters in metastatic colorectal cancer patients receiving first-line FOLFIRI treatment.
Membrane transporters are widely recognized as important determinants of drug disposition and response, generating increasing interest on the pharmacological implications of their genetic variations. The aim of this study was to elucidate the predictive/prognostic role of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier (SLC) protein polymorphisms on irinotecan (FOLFIRI regimen) outcome.
