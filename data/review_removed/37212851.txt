Gene polymorphisms affect postoperative imatinib plasma levels and edema in adults with gastrointestinal stromal tumor.
<b>Aim:</b> To assess the role of genetic polymorphisms in postoperative imatinib concentrations and edema in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor. <b>Methods:</b> The relationships between genetic polymorphisms, imatinib concentrations and edema were explored. <b>Results:</b> Carriers of the rs683369 G-allele and rs2231142 T-allele had significantly higher imatinib concentrations. Grade ≥2 periorbital edemas were related to the carriership of two C-alleles in rs2072454 with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.85, two T-alleles in rs1867351 with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.42 and two A-alleles in rs11636419 with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.15. <b>Conclusion:</b> rs683369 and rs2231142 affect the metabolism of imatinib; rs2072454, rs1867351 and rs11636419 are related to grade ≥2 periorbital edemas.
