Carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome in chronic schizophrenia.
Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome is a clinically important issue. We report a case of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome in a 35-year-old schizophrenia patient. This patient had no previous food or medication allergy history and presented a negative test result of HLA-B*1502 genotype. After 19 days exposure of carbamazepine, high fever up to 39.4 Â°C, leucopenia (1670/mm3), proteinuria and bilateral lung field infiltration were developed. These clinically significant physical conditions resolved after discontinuing carbamazepine. The importance of genetic susceptibility other than HLA-B*1502 should not be overlooked in drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.
