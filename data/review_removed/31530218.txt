Optimization of initial dosing scheme of tacrolimus in pediatric refractory nephrotic syndrome patients based on CYP3A5 genotype and coadministration with wuzhi-capsule.
The present study aimed to optimize the tacrolimus initial dosing scheme in pediatric refractory nephrotic syndrome patients based on population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics.Demographic characteristics, concomitant medication, laboratory data, pharmacogenomics were collected to build the model and Monte Carlo was used to simulate the optimization of initial dosing scheme.Weight, the polymorphisms of <i>CYP3A5</i>, and concomitant medication of wuzhi-capsule were included into the covariates affecting tacrolimus clearance. In addition, with the same weight, there was difference in tacrolimus clearance in patients who carry <i>CYP3A5*3/*3</i> and no coadministration of wuzhi-capsule, patients who carry <i>CYP3A5*1</i> allele and no coadministration of wuzhi-capsule, patients who carry <i>CYP3A5*3/*3</i> and coadministration of wuzhi-capsule, patients who carry <i>CYP3A5*1</i> allele and coadministration of wuzhi-capsule, and their clearance ratios were 1:1.5:0.697:1.0455, respectively. Based on the differences of clearance in the above cases, we simulated different dosing regimens and obtained the optimal initial dose in each case.The present study recommended the tacrolimus initial dosing scheme in pediatric refractory nephrotic syndrome patients based on <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype and coadministration with wuzhi-capsule.
