Butyrylcholinesterase K and Apolipoprotein E-ɛ4 Reduce the Age of Onset of Alzheimer's Disease, Accelerate Cognitive Decline, and Modulate Donepezil Response in Mild Cognitively Impaired Subjects.
Genetic heterogeneity in amnestic mild cognitively impaired (aMCI) subjects could lead to variations in progression rates and response to cholinomimetic agents. Together with the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE-ɛ4) gene, butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) has become recently one of the few Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility genes with distinct pharmacogenomic properties.
