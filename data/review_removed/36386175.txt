The association of <i>ARRB1</i> polymorphisms with response to antidepressant treatment in depressed patients.
<b>Introduction:</b> β-arrestin 1, a protein encoded by <i>ARRB1</i> involved in receptor signaling, is a potential biomarker for the response to antidepressant drug (ATD) treatment in depression. We examined <i>ARRB1</i> genetic variants for their association with response following ATD treatment in METADAP, a cohort of 6-month ATD-treated depressed patients. <b>Methods:</b> Patients (<i>n</i> = 388) were assessed at baseline (M0) and after 1 (M1), 3 (M3), and 6 months (M6) of treatment for Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) changes, response, and remission. Whole-gene <i>ARRB1</i> variants identified from high-throughput sequencing were separated by a minor allele frequency (MAF)≥5%. Frequent variants (i.e., MAF≥5%) annotated by RegulomeDB as likely affecting transcription factor binding were analyzed using mixed-effects models. Rare variants (i.e., MAF<5%) were analyzed using a variant set analysis. <b>Results:</b> The variant set analysis of rare variants was significant in explaining HDRS score changes (<i>T</i> = 878.9; <i>p</i> = 0.0033) and remission (<i>T</i> = -1974.1; <i>p</i> = 0.034). Rare variant counts were significant in explaining response (<i>p</i> = 0.016), remission (<i>p</i> = 0.022), and HDRS scores at M1 (<i>p</i> = 0.0021) and M3 (<i>p</i>=<0.001). rs553664 and rs536852 were significantly associated with the HDRS score (rs553664: <i>p</i> = 0.0055 | rs536852: <i>p</i> = 0.046) and remission (rs553664: <i>p</i> = 0.026 | rs536852: <i>p</i> = 0.012) through their interactions with time. At M6, significantly higher HDRS scores were observed in rs553664 AA homozygotes (13.98 ± 1.06) compared to AG heterozygotes (10.59 ± 0.86; <i>p</i> = 0.014) and in rs536852 GG homozygotes (14.88 ± 1.10) compared to AG heterozygotes (11.26 ± 0.95; <i>p</i> = 0.0061). Significantly lower remitter rates were observed in rs536852 GG homozygotes (8%, n = 56) compared to AG heterozygotes (42%, <i>n</i> = 105) at M6 (<i>p</i> = 0.0018). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results suggest <i>ARRB1</i> variants may influence the response to ATD treatment in depressed patients. Further analysis of functional <i>ARRB1</i> variants and rare variant burden in other populations would help corroborate our exploratory analysis. β-arrestin 1 and genetic variants of <i>ARRB1</i> may be useful clinical biomarkers for clinical improvement following ATD treatment in depressed individuals. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> clinicaltrials.gov; identifier NCT00526383.
