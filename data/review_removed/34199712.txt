Effect of Genetic Variability in 20 Pharmacogenes on Concentrations of Tamoxifen and Its Metabolites.
Tamoxifen, as a treatment of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, is a weak anti-estrogen that requires metabolic activation to form metabolites with higher anti-estrogenic activity. Endoxifen is the most-studied active tamoxifen metabolite, and endoxifen concentrations are highly associated with <i>CYP2D6</i> activity. Associations of tamoxifen efficacy with measured or <i>CYP2D6</i>-predicted endoxifen concentrations have been inconclusive. Another active metabolite, 4-OHtam, and other, less active metabolites, Z-4'-endoxifen and Z-4'-OHtam, have also been reported to be associated with tamoxifen efficacy.
