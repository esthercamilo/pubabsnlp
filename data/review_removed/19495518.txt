CYP2C9 polymorphism: prevalence in healthy and warfarin-treated Malay and Chinese in Malaysia.
Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C9 among different populations in different geographical regions could be different. CYP2C9 has been reported to be the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, including warfarin and other drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Realising the importance of inter-individual differences in the genetic profile in determining the outcome of a drug therapy, this study was conducted to explore the types and frequencies of CYP2C9 alleles in healthy and warfarin-treated Malays and Chinese, the two major ethnic groups in Malaysia. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of the types and frequencies of common CYP2C9 alleles (*1, *2, *3 and *4) among the healthy unrelated individuals and diseased patients prescribed with warfarin.
