Effect of polymorphisms within methotrexate pathway genes on methotrexate toxicity and plasma levels in adults with hematological malignancies.
Pharmacogenetics of methotrexate (MTX) contributes to interindividual differences in toxicity. We aimed to evaluate the impact of SNPs within the MTX pathway genes on MTX-induced toxicity and MTX plasma levels at 48 h following treatment in Asian adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
