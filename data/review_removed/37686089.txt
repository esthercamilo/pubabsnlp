Genetic Variation in miR-27a Is Associated with Fluoropyrimidine-Associated Toxicity in Patients with Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Variants after Genotype-Guided Dose Reduction.
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (<i>DPYD</i>) is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the metabolism of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. However, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in <i>DPYD</i> only partially explain fluoropyrimidine-induced toxicity. The expression of <i>DPYD</i> has previously been shown to be regulated by microRNA-27a (miR-27a) and a common miR-27a SNV (rs895819) has been associated with an increased risk of toxicity in patients harboring a <i>DPYD</i> variant who received standard fluoropyrimidine dosing. We investigated if the miR-27a rs895819 SNV was associated with toxicity in <i>DPYD</i> wildtype patients and carriers of <i>DPYD</i> variants who received a reduced dose. The regulation of <i>DPYD</i> using miR-27a was investigated in HepG2 cells utilizing a miR-27a mimic. miR-27a overexpression decreased <i>DPYD</i> mRNA expression compared to control cells (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). In a cohort of patients that received pre-emptive <i>DPYD</i> genotyping, 45 patients had a <i>DPYD</i> variant and 180 were wildtype. Patients heterozygous for rs895819 had an increased risk of toxicity, which was seen in both patients who were wildtype for <i>DPYD</i> variants (OR (95%CI) = 1.99 (1.00-3.99)) and <i>DPYD</i> variant carriers (OR (95%CI) = 8.10 (1.16-86.21)). Therefore, miR-27a rs895819 may be a clinically relevant predictor of fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicities. Furthermore, toxicity was more profound in <i>DPYD</i> variant carriers, even after <i>DPYD</i> genotype-guided dose reduction. This suggests that patients may benefit from miR-27a genotyping to guide fluoropyrimidine dosing.
