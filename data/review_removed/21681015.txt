Genome-wide association studies of asthma.
Bronchial asthma is a common inflammatory disease caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. To discover the genes and cellular pathways underlying asthma, a large number of genetic studies have been conducted. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which comprehensively assess genes related to multifactorial diseases and drug reactivity, have enhanced understanding of human diseases. From 2007, GWAS of susceptibility to asthma in Caucasian, Mexican, and African-ancestry populations have been conducted and several susceptible loci were identified. Recently, much larger consortium-based GWAS analyses of collaborative samples with adequate statistical power were performed, and the implicated genes suggested a role for communication of epithelial damage to the adaptive immune system and activation of airway inflammation. Furthermore, GWAS identified candidate loci associated with natural variations in lung function, blood eosinophilia and eosinophilic esophagitis, which is inflammation of the esophagus with abnormal infiltration of eosinophils in an allergic reaction. Comparing GWAS in asthma and these clinical phenotypes might help to clarify the mechanisms underlying asthma. Pharmacogenomics analyses using GWAS regarding genetic factors related to the effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy and inhaled beta(2)- adrenergic agonists are ongoing now. Although a more complete collection of associated genes and pathways is needed, biologic insights revealed by GWAS provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of asthma and contribute to the development of better treatment and preventive strategies.
