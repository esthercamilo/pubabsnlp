Genetic variation in the serotonin transporter and HTR1B receptor predicts reduced bone formation during serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment in older adults.
Studies have reported an association between serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and accelerated bone loss. Genetic variation in the serotonin system might modulate bone metabolism changes during SRI treatment. In a clinical trial we examined functional genetic polymorphisms of serotonin transporter and receptors involved in bone metabolism to determine whether they predict changes in bone metabolism during SRI treatment.
