Introducing a simple and cost-effective RT-PCR protocol for detection of DPYD*2A polymorphism: the first study in Kurdish population.
Fluoropyrimidines, the major chemotherapeutic agents in various malignancies treatment, are metabolized by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). DPD deficiency can lead to severe and sometimes fatal toxicity. In the present study, we developed a simple protocol to detect the DPYD*2A variant. Common side effects in patients treated with these drugs were also evaluated in a Kurdish population.
