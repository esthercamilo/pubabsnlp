Erlotinib in African Americans with advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a prospective randomized study with genetic and pharmacokinetic analyses.
Prospective studies on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in African Americans with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not previously been performed. In this phase II randomized study, 55 African Americans with NSCLC received 150 mg/day erlotinib or a body weight-adjusted dose with subsequent escalations to the maximum-allowable dose, 200 mg/day, to achieve rash. Erlotinib and OSI-420 exposures were lower than those observed in previous studies, consistent with CYP3A pharmacogenetics implying higher metabolic activity. Tumor genetics showed only two EGFR mutations, EGFR amplification in 17/47 samples, eight KRAS mutations, and five EML4-ALK translocations. Although absence of rash was associated with shorter time to progression (TTP), disease-control rate, TTP, and 1-year survival were not different between the two dose groups, indicating the dose-to-rash strategy failed to increase clinical benefit. Low incidence of toxicity and low erlotinib exposure suggest standardized and maximum-allowable dosing may be suboptimal in African Americans.
