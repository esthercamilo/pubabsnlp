Effect of <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>MDR1</i> and <i>POR</i> Genetic Polymorphisms in Immunosuppressive Treatment in Chilean Kidney Transplanted Patients.
Cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (TAC) are immunosuppressant drugs characterized by a narrow therapeutic range and high pharmacokinetic variability. The effect of polymorphisms in genes related to the metabolism and transport of these drugs, namely <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>MDR1</i> and <i>POR</i> genes, has been evaluated in diverse populations. However, the impact of these polymorphisms on drug disposition is not well established in Latin American populations. Using <i>TaqMan</i>Â® probes, we determined the allelic frequency of seven variants in <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>MDR1</i> and <i>POR</i> in 139 Chilean renal transplant recipients, of which 89 were treated with CsA and 50 with TAC. We tested associations between variants and trough and/or 2-hour concentrations, normalized by dose (C<sub>0</sub>/D and C<sub>2</sub>/D) at specific time points post-transplant. We found that <i>CYP3A5*3/*3</i> carriers required lower doses of TAC. In TAC treated patients, most <i>CYP3A5*3/*3</i> carriers presented higher C<sub>0</sub>/D and a high proportion of patients with C<sub>0</sub> levels outside the therapeutic range relative to other genotypes. These results reinforce the value of considering <i>CYP3A5</i> genotypes alongside therapeutic drug monitoring for TAC treated Chilean kidney recipients.
