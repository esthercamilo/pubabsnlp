The validation of pharmacogenetics for the identification of Fabry patients to be treated with migalastat.
Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the α-galactosidase A gene. Migalastat, a pharmacological chaperone, binds to specific mutant forms of α-galactosidase A to restore lysosomal activity.
