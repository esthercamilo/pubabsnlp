Genome-Wide Association Approach Identified Novel Genetic Predictors of Heart Rate Response to β-Blockers.
For many indications, the negative chronotropic effect of β-blockers is important to their efficacy, yet the heart rate (HR) response to β-blockers varies. Herein, we sought to use a genome-wide association approach to identify novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with HR response to β-blockers.
