Retrospective pharmacogenetic analysis of a pediatric patient under anticoagulant treatment: Clinical case.
We present the clinical case of a 10-year-old patient diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy who registered INR values above 10 upon receiving standard doses of acenocoumarol, as well as other values reported as uncoagulable, forcing the discontinuation and restart of treatment more than once. Expected and stable INR levels were achieved after more than 30 days of treatment, surprisingly with half the recommended dose for a patient of her age and weight. We decided to conduct a retrospective pharmacogenomic analysis including nucleotide genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) with different degrees of association with the dose/response to antivitamin K (AVK) drugs: rs2108622 (gene CYP4F2), rs9923231, rs7294 (gene VKORC1), rs1799853, and rs1057910 (CYP2C9 gene) using TaqMan® RT-PCR. The patient was homozygous for rs9923231 (VKORC1) and heterozygous for rs2108622 (CYP4F2),a genetic profile strongly associated with a requirement of lower AVK doses as shown by national and international evidence. In conclusion, the pharmacogenetic analysis confirmed that this patient’s genetic conditions, involving low expression of the VKA therapeutic target, required a lower dose than that established in clinical protocols as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the PharmGKB® for coumarin drugs. A previous genotypic analysis of the patient would have allowed reaching the therapeutic range sooner, thus avoiding potential bleeding risks. This shows the importance of pharmacogenetic analyses for highly variable treatments with a narrow therapeutic range.
