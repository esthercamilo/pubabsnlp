The Challenge and Importance of Integrating Drug-Nutrient-Genome Interactions in Personalized Cardiovascular Healthcare.
Despite the rich armamentarium of available drugs against different forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD), major challenges persist in their safe and effective use. These include high rates of adverse drug reactions, increased heterogeneity in patient responses, suboptimal drug efficacy, and in some cases limited compliance. Dietary elements (including food, beverages, and supplements) can modulate drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and action, with significant implications for drug efficacy and safety. Genetic variation can further modulate the response to diet, to a drug, and to the interaction of the two. These interactions represent a largely unexplored territory that holds considerable promise in the field of personalized medicine in CVD. Herein, we highlight examples of clinically relevant drug-nutrient-genome interactions, map the challenges faced to date, and discuss their future perspectives in personalized cardiovascular healthcare in light of the rapid technological advances.
