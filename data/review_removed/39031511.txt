Urine metabolomics signature reveals novel determinants of adrenal suppression in children taking inhaled corticosteroids to control asthma symptoms.
Asthma is routinely treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Asthma patients on ICS are at increased risk of adrenal suppression, a potentially serious effect of long-term glucocorticoid exposure; however, this relationship is poorly understood. Therefore, this study aims to identify metabolite biomarkers related to adrenal suppression in asthma patients taking ICS.
