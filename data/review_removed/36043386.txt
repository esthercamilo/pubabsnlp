Detection of relevant pharmacogenetic information through exome sequencing in oncology.
<b>Background:</b> Germline sequencing of individual genomes can detect alleles responsible for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in relation to chemotherapy, targeted agents, antiemetics or pain treatment. <b>Materials & methods:</b> To evaluate the interest of such pharmacogenetic information, the authors retrospectively analyzed genes known to have an impact on cancer therapy in a cohort of 445 solid cancers patients. <b>Results:</b> Six patients treated with 5-fluorouracil carrying one <i>DPYD</i> variant classified as 1A showed decreased drug mean clearance (p = 0.01). Regarding <i>CYP2D6</i>, all patients (n = 5) with predicted <i>CYP2D6</i> poor or ultra-rapid metabolizer status experienced adverse drug reactions related to opioid therapy. <b>Conclusion:</b> Genomic germline sequencing performed for theragnostic issues in patients with a solid tumor, can provide relevant information about common pharmacogenetic alleles.
