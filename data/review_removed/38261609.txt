Role of Transporters and Enzymes in Metabolism and Distribution of 4-Chlorokynurenine (AV-101).
4-Chlorokynurenine (4-Cl-KYN, AV-101) is a prodrug of a NMDA receptor antagonist and is in clinical development for potential CNS indications. We sought to further understand the distribution and metabolism of 4-Cl-KYN, as this information might provide a strategy to enhance the clinical development of this drug. We used excretion studies in rats, <i>in vitro</i> transporter assays, and pharmacogenetic analysis of clinical trial data to determine how 4-Cl-KYN and metabolites are distributed. Our data indicated that a novel acetylated metabolite (<i>N</i>-acetyl-4-Cl-KYN) did not affect the uptake of 4-Cl-KYN across the blood-brain barrier via LAT1. 4-Cl-KYN and its metabolites were found to be renally excreted in rodents. In addition, we found that <i>N</i>-acetyl-4-Cl-KYN inhibited renal and hepatic transporters involved in excretion. Thus, this metabolite has the potential to limit the excretion of a range of compounds. Our pharmacogenetic analysis found that a SNP in <i>N</i>-acetyltransferase 8 (<i>NAT8</i>, rs13538) was linked to levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-4-Cl-KYN relative to 4-Cl-KYN found in the plasma and that a SNP in <i>SLC7A5</i> (rs28582913) was associated with the plasma levels of the active metabolite, 7-Cl-KYNA. Thus, we have a pharmacogenetics-based association for plasma drug level that could aid in the drug development of 4-Cl-KYN and have investigated the interaction of a novel metabolite with drug transporters.
