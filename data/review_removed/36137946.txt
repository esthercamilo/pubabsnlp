<i>DPYD</i> and <i>TYMS</i> polymorphisms as predictors of 5 fluorouracil toxicity in colorectal cancer patients.
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is an essential component of systemic chemotherapy for CRC. Our objective was to determine the genotypic frequency of polymorphisms affecting dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (<i>DPYD</i>) and thymidylate synthetase (<i>TYMS</i>) genes and to correlate the genetic profile with the toxicity due to 5-FU, also considering nongenetic factors. This is a prospective study that involved 66 patients. We extracted DNA by salting out methods. We carried out the genotyping of the different polymorphisms by simple PCR for the <i>TYMS</i> 5'UTR and by PCR-RFLP for <i>DPYD</i>: 1905 + 1 G > A, 85 T > C, 496 A > G, 1679 T > G, c.483 + 18G > A and the <i>TYMS</i>: 5'UTR VNTR, 5'UTR G > C and 3'UTR. The study of the association of <i>DPYD</i> and <i>TYMS</i> polymorphisms with the various signs of toxicity under 5-FU revealed that the polymorphisms 496 A > G were significantly associated with hepatotoxicity: OR = <b>3.85</b> (p = 0.04). In addition, 85 T > C was significantly associated with mucositis and neurotoxicity: OR = <b>4.35</b> (p = 0.03), OR = <b>3.79</b> (p = 0.02). For <i>TYMS,</i> the only significant association we observed for 5'UTR with vomiting: OR = <b>3.34</b> (p = 0.04). The incidence of adverse reactions related to 5-FU appears to be influenced in patients with CRC by the identified <i>DPYD</i> and <i>TYMS</i> gene polymorphisms in the Tunisian population.
