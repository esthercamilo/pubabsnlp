Pharmacogenomic associations of cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetic candidate genes with 4hydroxycyclophosphamide formation in children with Cancer.
4-hydroxycyclophosphamide (4HCY) is the principal precursor to the cytotoxic metabolite of cyclophosphamide (CY), which is often used as first-line treatment of children with cancer. There is conflicting data regarding the relationship between CY efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics with the genes encoding proteins involved in 4HCY pharmacokinetics, specifically its formation and elimination.
