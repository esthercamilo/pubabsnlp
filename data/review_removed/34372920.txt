A novel machine learning-based approach for the computational functional assessment of pharmacogenomic variants.
The field of pharmacogenomics focuses on the way a person's genome affects his or her response to a certain dose of a specified medication. The main aim is to utilize this information to guide and personalize the treatment in a way that maximizes the clinical benefits and minimizes the risks for the patients, thus fulfilling the promises of personalized medicine. Technological advances in genome sequencing, combined with the development of improved computational methods for the efficient analysis of the huge amount of generated data, have allowed the fast and inexpensive sequencing of a patient's genome, hence rendering its incorporation into clinical routine practice a realistic possibility.
