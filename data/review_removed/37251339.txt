Genetic variants of genes involved in thiopurine metabolism pathway are associated with 6-mercaptopurine toxicity in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients from Ethiopia.
<b>Introduction:</b> Genetic variation in the <i>thiopurine S-methyltransferase</i> (<i>TPMT</i>) gene by and large predicts variability in 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) related toxicities. However, some individuals without genetic variants in <i>TPMT</i> still develop toxicity that necessitates 6-MP dose reduction or interruption. Genetic variants of other genes in the thiopurine pathway have been linked to 6-MP related toxicities previously. <b>Objective:</b> The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of genetic variants in <i>ITPA</i>, <i>TPMT</i>, <i>NUDT15</i>, <i>XDH</i>, and <i>ABCB1</i> on 6-MP related toxicities in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from Ethiopia. <b>Methods:</b> Genotyping of <i>ITPA</i>, and <i>XDH</i> was performed using KASP genotyping assay, while that of <i>TPMT</i>, <i>NUDT15,</i> and <i>ABCB1</i> with TaqMan<sup>®</sup> SNP genotyping assays. Clinical profile of the patients was collected for the first 6 months of the maintenance phase treatment. The primary outcome was the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia. Bivariable followed by multivariable cox regression analysis was performed to identify genetic variants associated with the development of grade 4 neutropenia within the first 6 months of maintenance treatment. <b>Results:</b> In this study, genetic variants in <i>XDH</i> and <i>ITPA</i> were associated with 6-MP related grade 4 neutropenia and neutropenic fever, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that patients who are homozygous (CC) for <i>XDH</i> rs2281547 were 2.956 times (AHR 2.956, 95% CI = 1.494-5.849, <i>p</i> = 0.002) more likely to develop grade 4 neutropenia than those with the TT genotype. <b>Conclusion:</b> In conclusion, in this cohort, <i>XDH</i> rs2281547 was identified as a genetic risk factor for grade 4 hematologic toxicities in ALL patients treated with 6-MP. Genetic polymorphisms in enzymes other than <i>TPMT</i> involved in the 6-mercaptopurine pathway should be considered during its use to avoid hematological toxicity.
