Effects of CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms on steady-state pharmacokinetics and hemodynamic effects of tamsulosin in humans.
Tamsulosin is one of the most potent drugs currently available to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP3A are the two major enzymes responsible for tamsulosin metabolism. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics and hemodynamic effects of tamsulosin in humans.
