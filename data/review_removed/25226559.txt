Pharmacogenetics of drug response in Parkinson's disease.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating, demoralizing and financially devastating condition affecting 1% of population at the age of 60 years. Thus, very important issue to address is individual therapy optimization. Recent results have shown evidence that variable efficacy of treatment and risk of motor and mental complications could have genetic origin. Significant roles in that process play (pharmaco)genomic/genetic studies of PD. Variability in genes coding for drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug receptors and proteins involved in drug pathway signaling is an important factor determining inter-individual variability in drug responses. Interpersonal differences in drug responses are clearly documented although individualized treatment of PD is not widely known. Treatment with antiparkinsonian drugs is associated with the development of complications, such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), hallucinations and excessive daytime sleepiness. Carriers of specific genetic polymorphisms are particularly susceptible to development of some of these drug adverse effects. Pharmacogenomics aims to understand the relationship between genetic factors and inter-individual variations in drug responses, and to translate this information in therapy tailored to individual patient genetics. Relatively few efforts have been made to investigate the role of pharmacogenetics in the individual response to anti-PD drugs. Thus, many genetic variations and polymorphisms in myriad of different proteins can influence individual response to anti-PD drugs.
