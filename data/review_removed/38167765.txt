Interrogating Pharmacogenetics Using Next-Generation Sequencing.
Pharmacogenetics or pharmacogenomics (PGx) is the study of the role of inherited or acquired sequence change in drug response. With the rapid evolution of molecular techniques, bioinformatic tools, and increased throughput of functional genomic studies, the discovery of PGx associations and clinical implementation of PGx test results have now moved beyond a handful variants in single pharmacogenes and multi-gene panels that interrogate a few pharmacogenes to whole-exome and whole-genome scales. Although some laboratories have adopted next-generation sequencing (NGS) as a testing platform for PGx and other molecular tests, most clinical laboratories that offer PGx tests still use targeted genotyping approaches.
