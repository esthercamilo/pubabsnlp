NMR-based pharmacometabonomics: A new paradigm for personalised or precision medicine.
Metabolic profiling by NMR spectroscopy or hyphenated mass spectrometry, known as metabonomics or metabolomics, is an important tool for systems-based approaches in biology and medicine. The experiments are typically done in a diagnostic fashion where changes in metabolite profiles are interpreted as a consequence of an intervention or event; be that a change in diet, the administration of a drug, physical exertion or the onset of a disease. By contrast, pharmacometabonomics takes a prognostic approach to metabolic profiling, in order to predict the effects of drug dosing before it occurs. Differences in pre-dose metabolite profiles between groups of subjects are used to predict post-dose differences in response to drug administration. Thus the paradigm is inverted and pharmacometabonomics is the metabolic equivalent of pharmacogenomics. Although the field is still in its infancy, it is expected that pharmacometabonomics, alongside pharmacogenomics, will assist with the delivery of personalised or precision medicine to patients, which is a critical goal of 21st century healthcare.
