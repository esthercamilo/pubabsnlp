Monitoring the tacrolimus concentration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of kidney transplant recipients.
Tacrolimus is a critical dose drug and to avoid under- and overexposure, therapeutic drug monitoring is standard practice. However, rejection and drug-related toxicity occur despite whole-blood tacrolimus pre-dose concentrations ([Tac]<sub>blood</sub> ) being on target. Monitoring tacrolimus concentrations at the target site (within peripheral blood mononuclear cells; [Tac]<sub>cells</sub> ) may better correlate with drug-efficacy. The aim of this study was to (1) investigate the relationship between [Tac]<sub>blood</sub> and [Tac]<sub>cells</sub> , (2) identify factors affecting the tacrolimus distribution in cells and whole-blood, and (3) study the relationship between [Tac]<sub>cells</sub> and clinical outcomes after kidney transplantation.
