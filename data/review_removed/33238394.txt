VEGF-Related Germinal Polymorphisms May Identify a Subgroup of Breast Cancer Patients with Favorable Outcome under Bevacizumab-Based Therapy-A Message from COMET, a French Unicancer Multicentric Study.
The prospective multicenter COMET trial followed a cohort of 306 consecutive metastatic breast cancer patients receiving bevacizumab and paclitaxel as first-line chemotherapy. This study was intended to identify and validate reliable biomarkers to better predict bevacizumab treatment outcomes and allow for a more personalized use of this antiangiogenic agent. To that end, we aimed to establish risk scores for survival prognosis dichotomization based on classic clinico-pathological criteria combined or not with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The genomic DNA of 306 patients was extracted and a panel of 13 SNPs, covering seven genes previously documented to be potentially involved in drug response, were analyzed by means of high-throughput genotyping. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, the hazard model based on a triple-negative cancer phenotype variable, combined with specific SNPs in <i>VEGFA</i> (rs833061), <i>VEGFR1</i> (rs9582036) and <i>VEGFR2</i> (rs1870377), had the highest predictive value. The overall survival hazard ratio of patients assigned to the poor prognosis group based on this model was 3.21 (95% CI (2.33-4.42); <i>p</i> < 0.001). We propose that combining this pharmacogenetic approach with classical clinico-pathological characteristics could markedly improve clinical decision-making for breast cancer patients receiving bevacizumab-based therapy.
