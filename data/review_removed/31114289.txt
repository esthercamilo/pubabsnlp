<i>VKORC1</i> variants as significant predictors of warfarin dose in Emiratis.
<b>Purpose:</b> Variability in response to warfarin is one of the main obstacles challenging its use in clinical practice. Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex (VKORC) is the target enzyme of warfarin, and variations in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in <i>VKORC1</i>, coding for this enzyme, are known to cause resistance to warfarin treatment. This study aimed to explore <i>VKORC1</i> variants in Emirati patients receiving warfarin treatment and to correlate their genotypes at the studied SNPs to their maintenance warfarin dose. <b>Patients and methods:</b> Sanger sequencing of the majority of the <i>VKORC1</i> gene was applied to samples from 90 patients and 117 normal individuals recruited from Tawam Hospital, Al-Ain, UAE. Genotypes at the following variants were determined (rs9923231, rs188009042, rs61742245, rs17708472, rs9934438, rs8050894, rs2359612, rs7294). Statistical analysis was applied, including ANOVA, cross-tabulation, and multiple linear regression analysis, to determine the ability of nongenetic factors (age and gender) and genetic factors (<i>VKORC1</i> genotypes) to explain variability in warfarin dose in patients. <b>Results:</b> Different frequencies of minor alleles were detected in the selected SNPs. Significant variation among genotypes at six <i>VKORC1</i> variants were identified (rs9923231, rs9934438, rs8050894, rs2359612, rs7294). The main predictors for warfarin dose were rs9923231, age, and rs61742245 with 50.7% of the average warfarin dose in our sample could be explained by a regression model built on these three factors. <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first report of the explanatory power of <i>VKORC1</i> genotypes and nongenetic factors (age and gender) on warfarin dose among Emiratis. Also, this study highlighted the positive effect of considering rare pharmacogenomic variants on explaining warfarin dose variability.
