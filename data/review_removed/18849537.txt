Progress in pharmacogenomics and its promise for medicine.
Pharmacogenomics addresses the impacts of diverse and multiple genes in populations as determinants of responses of individual patients to drugs. The field has its roots in basic science, and is pivotal in drug development, elucidation of therapeutic efficacy, and constraining the risks of adverse drug reactions. Regulatory agencies are relying increasingly on pharmacogenomics for identification of patients who are particularly likely to benefit from treatment with specific agents and exclusion of those at risk of adverse drug reactions. Practical applications of pharmacogenomics already abound particularly in the use of drugs acting on the central nervous system and on the cardiovascular system. The Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine (SEBM) is proud and pleased to have devoted its 2008 symposium, presented at the annual Experimental Biology meeting in San Diego on April 6, 2008, to advances in pharmacogenomics with emphasis on drug development, regulatory agency considerations, and clinical applications.
