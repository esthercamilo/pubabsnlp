<i>MIR27A</i> rs895819 TC genotype increases risk of fluoropyrimidine-induced severe toxicity independently of <i>DPYD</i> variations.
<b>Aim:</b> MicroRNA 27a (miR-27a) regulates post-transcriptionally DPD activity. We have analyzed the association of <i>MIR27A</i> rs895819T>C variation, that modulates miR-27a expression, with fluropyrimidine-induced toxicity. <b>Materials & methods:</b> <i>MIR27A</i> rs895819T>C genotyping was conducted by TaqMan® allelic discrimination assay in 313 FP-treated cancer patients. <b>Results:</b> In overdominance (TC vs TT + CC), TC genotype was associated with grade 3-4 toxicity (p = 0.002), any grade toxicity (p = 0.052), and delayed drug administration or therapy discontinuation (p = 0.038). Odds of grade 3-4 toxicity were increased by both <i>DPYD</i> deficiency (OR: 8.923; p = 0.006) and <i>MIR27A</i> rs895819 TC genotype (OR: 3.865; p = 0.002). <b>Conclusion:</b> <i>MIR27A</i> rs895819 TC genotype is an independent risk factor for fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity in the Greek population. Thus, <i>MIR27A</i> rs895819TC patients can be closely monitored for fluoropyrimidine-induced severe toxicity.
