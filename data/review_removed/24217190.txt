Pharmacogenetics: has the time come for pharmacists to embrace and implement the science?
Pharmacogenetics--the study of interindividual differences in medication response as a result of genetic variations--has emerged as a potentially useful tool for individualizing medication regimens for patients. Genetic variations can affect drug disposition inseveral ways, from modifying receptor sensitivities to impacting drug metabolism. Over the last several years, the Food and Drug Administration has been steadily including pharmacogenetic information in drug labeling for several commonly prescribed drugs. Several organizations are attempting to provide evidence-based guidelines for widespread implementation and interpretation. Pharmacists, armed with knowledge of drug metabolism pathways and drug-gene interactions, are uniquely positioned to play an active role in the education, provision, and clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics.
