Interprofessional education through a telehealth team based learning exercise focused on pharmacogenomics.
Traditional interprofessional educational (IPE) exercises are those where learning exists "about, from, and with" trainees in two or more professions in order to prepare health sciences professionals to work on interprofessional teams. One emerging difficulty with IPE is the paucity of health profession students at single institutions, and the geographic and financial constraints of multi-institutional collaboration.
