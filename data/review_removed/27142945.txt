Differences in genetic variants in lopinavir disposition among HIV-infected Bantu Africans.
Variability in lopinavir (LPV) plasma concentration among patients could be due to genetic polymorphisms. This study set to evaluate significance of variants in CYP3A4/5, SLCO1B1 and ABCC2 on LPV plasma concentration among African HIV-positive patients.
