Genome-wide association study of letrozole plasma concentrations identifies non-exonic variants that may affect CYP2A6 metabolic activity.
Letrozole is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor used to treat hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Variability in letrozole efficacy and toxicity may be partially attributable to variable systemic drug exposure, which may be influenced by germline variants in the enzymes responsible for letrozole metabolism, including cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6). The objective of this genome-wide association study (GWAS) was to identify polymorphisms associated with steady-state letrozole concentrations.
