Proteomics in rheumatology: The beginning of a fairy tale?
One of the major challenges in proteome research is to translate its applications to the setting of human diseases. Proteomics in rheumatology is an area with marked potential including applications ranging from diagnostics, over therapeutic monitoring to discovery of new potential therapeutic targets. Biomarkers will be essential to discriminate between clinical similar rheumatic diseases, to monitor disease-states or to install the best appropriate therapy. Especially in the field of rheumatology, analysis of specific genes and/or their expression products by pharmacogenetics/-genomics or pharmacoproteomics could be necessary to enable an effective, patient-tailored therapy. In rheumatology, direct examination of proteins may be of utmost importance, as it is already known that PTMs, such as citrullination of proteins or peptides, may be involved in certain rheumatic diseases. The discovery and validation of antibodies directed against citrullinated proteins/peptides in rheumatic diseases using proteome analysis approaches has been described. Gel-free methods, SELDI-approaches and classic 2-DE approaches have been deployed on body fluids as well as on target tissues in different rheumatic diseases. Proteomics in rheumatology is on the rise and pilot studies have indicated that the application of proteomics-based technologies in rheumatic diseases appears to be an exciting example of translational research.
