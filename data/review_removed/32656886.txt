Analysis of polymorphisms of canine Cytochrome P 450-CYP2D15.
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) proteins constitute a large ancient family of oxidative enzymes essential for the efficient elimination of a wide variety of clinically used drugs. Polymorphic variants of human CYP2D6 are associated with the conversion rate and efficacy of several drugs such as antidepressants. Polymorphisms of the canine orthologue CYP2D15 are of interest because these antidepressants are also used in dogs with behavioral problems and the outcome of the treatment is variable. However, the annotated CYP2D15 gene is incomplete and inaccurately assembled in CanFam3.1, hampering DNA sequence analysis of the gene in individual dogs. We elucidated the complete exon-intron structure of CYP2D15 to enable comprehensive genotyping of the gene using genomic DNA. We surveyed variations of the gene in four diverse dog breeds and identified novel polymorphisms in exon 2 in border collies. Further investigation to establish the impact of these canine CYP2D15 polymorphisms on interindividual variability in expression and function of this metabolizing enzyme is now feasible. Further knowledge of CYP pharmacogenetics will help individualize therapy and thereby increase therapeutic efficacy, especially in the use of antidepressants in veterinary behavioral medicine.
