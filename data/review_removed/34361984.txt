Clinical Relevance of a 16-Gene Pharmacogenetic Panel Test for Medication Management in a Cohort of 135 Patients.
There is a growing number of evidence-based indications for pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing. We aimed to evaluate clinical relevance of a 16-gene panel test for PGx-guided pharmacotherapy. In an observational cohort study, we included subjects tested with a PGx panel for variants of <i>ABCB1</i>, <i>COMT</i>, <i>CYP1A2</i>, <i>CYP2B6</i>, <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>CYP2C9</i>, <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i>, <i>CYP4F2</i>, <i>DPYD</i>, <i>OPRM1</i>, <i>POR</i>, <i>SLCO1B1</i>, <i>TPMT</i> and <i>VKORC1</i>. PGx-guided pharmacotherapy management was supported by the PGx expert system SONOGEN XP. The primary study outcome was PGx-based changes and recommendations regarding current and potential future medication. PGx-testing was triggered by specific drug-gene pairs in 102 subjects, and by screening in 33. Based on PharmGKB expert guidelines we identified at least one "actionable" variant in all 135 (100%) tested patients. Drugs that triggered PGx-testing were clopidogrel in 60, tamoxifen in 15, polypsychopharmacotherapy in 9, opioids in 7, and other in 11 patients. Among those, PGx variants resulted in clinical recommendations to change PGx-triggering drugs in 33 (32.4%), and other current pharmacotherapy in 23 (22.5%). Additional costs of panel vs. single gene tests are moderate, and the efficiency of PGx panel testing challenges traditional cost-benefit calculations for single drug-gene pairs. However, PGx-guided pharmacotherapy requires specialized expert consultations with interdisciplinary collaborations.
