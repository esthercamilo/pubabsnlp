Elucidating the role of pharmacogenetics in irinotecan efficacy and adverse events in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.
Irinotecan is a cytotoxic agent that is widely used in the treatment of several types of solid tumors. However, although it is generally well tolerated, approximately 20% to 35% of patients develop severe toxicity, particularly delayed-type diarrhea and neutropenia. As the incidence of such toxicities is often associated with the <i>UGT1A1 *28/*28, *6/*28</i> and <i>*6/*6</i> genotypes, individualized dosing could reduce these adverse events. Furthermore, prospective trials have shown that patients harboring the <i>UGT1A1 *1/*1</i> and <i>*1/*28</i> genotypes can tolerate higher doses of irinotecan, which may in turn impact on a better outcome. Upfront <i>UGT1A1</i> genotyping could therefore be a usefulness strategy in order to individualize irinotecan dosing, but consensus on the recommended dose based on the <i>UGT1A1</i> genotype is still lacking.
