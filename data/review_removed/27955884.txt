Pharmacogenetics-guided analgesics in major abdominal surgery: Further benefits within an enhanced recovery protocol.
Effective, narcotic sparing analgesia is a major component of Enhanced Recovery Protocols (ERP), however the risk of poor analgesia and opioid related side effects (ORADE) remains an issue related to poor outcomes and satisfaction, and is strongly related to the risk of narcotic dependence after surgery. A variety of genes can impact narcotic and non-steroidal (NSAID) drug efficacy including: the CYP family (drug metabolism-narcotics and NSAID), or COMT/ABCB1/OPRM1 (functional receptor and transport activity for analgesia vs side effects). The purpose of this study was to perform the first assessment of the impact of a pharmacogenetics (PGx) guided selection of analgesics following major abdominal surgery within an ERP.
