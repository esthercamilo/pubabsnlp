PARC report: health outcomes and value of personalized medicine interventions: impact on patient care.
The incorporation of personalized medicine interventions into routine healthcare constitutes an opportunity to improve patients' quality of life, as it empowers implementation of innovative, individualized clinical interventions that maximize efficacy and/or minimize the risk of adverse drug reactions.
