Characterization of <i>POR</i> haplotype distribution in African populations and comparison with other global populations.
<b>Background & aim:</b> POR is an enzyme that mediates electron transfer to enable the drug-metabolizing activity of CYP450 proteins. However, <i>POR</i> has been understudied in pharmacogenomics despite this vital role. This study aimed to characterize the genetic variation in <i>POR</i> across African populations and to compare the star allele (haplotype) distribution with that in other global populations. <b>Materials & methods:</b> <i>POR</i> star alleles were called from whole-genome sequencing data using the StellarPGx pipeline. <b>Results:</b> In addition to the common <i>POR*1</i> and <i>*28</i> (defined by rs1057868), five novel rare haplotypes were computationally inferred. No significant frequency differences were observed among the majority of African populations. However, <i>POR*28</i> was observed at a higher frequency in individuals of non-African ancestry. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study highlights the distribution of <i>POR</i> alleles in Africa and across global populations with a view toward informing future precision medicine implementation.
