How can we improve antibody-based cancer therapy?
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as a class of novel oncology therapeutics are demonstrating clinical efficacy as measured by tumor response (shrinkage in tumor size), and prolongations in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). However, clinical benefits are often limited to when antibodies are used in combination with chemotherapy or radiation modalities, with tumor responses only seen in a fraction of patients, and improvements in PFS and OS are incremental.1 The potential of mAbs and mAb constructs has yet to be fully exploited for maximal clinical benefit. New approaches to further improve the effectiveness of these mAb therapies include (1) selection of patients who may derive the most benefit based on the molecular characteristics of their tumors; (2) improvements in biodistribution to maximize delivery of mAbs to susceptible tumor cells; and (3) optimization of antibody immune effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
