Oncogenomics.
The rapid developments in the field of genomics and proteomics are expected to lead to a further increase in the potential for early diagnosis, the fine-tuning of prognostic features of specific tumors and the detection of cancer predisposition. Oncogenomics has identified new drug targets for genotype-specific treatments and provided strategies to validate these targets and to develop drugs. With the potential need to stratify patients by genotype, clinical testing of targeted drugs has become more complicated while expectations of patients, investors, and funding agencies have become accelerated. Oncogenomics has progressed logically from molecular profiling to model systems, cancer pharmacology and clinical trials. Oncogenomics covers cutting-edge issues such as array-based diagnostics, pharmacogenomics, pharmacoproteomics and molecularly targeted therapeutics includes discussions of ethical, legal, and social issues related to cancer genomics and clinical trials.
