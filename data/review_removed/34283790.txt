Personal DNA Testing Increases Pharmacy Students' Confidence and Competence in Pharmacogenomics.
<b>Objective.</b> Pharmacogenomics, a key tool in personalized medicine, and therapeutic drug management is projected to become an integral part of pharmacy practice. This study describes an innovative pedagogy that used several interactive learning methods to increase learners' competence and perceptions in pharmacogenomics.<b>Methods.</b> First-year student pharmacists at the Medical College of Wisconsin participated in lectures, discussions, and patient care laboratory training on the topic of pharmacogenomics. These students were given the opportunity to undergo personal pharmacogenomics testing. Before and after these activities, participants were surveyed about their attitudes towards the use of pharmacogenomics in current and future practice.<b>Results.</b> Forty-five students participated in this voluntary personal pharmacogenomics testing and completed pre-course and post-course surveys. Significant improvements were seen in 22 of the 27 surveys questions responses from the pre-course to the post-course surveys. Student learning outcomes, competencies, and attitudes towards pharmacogenomics improved from a relatively neutral perception of pharmacogenomics to one of more confidence.<b>Conclusion.</b> This study demonstrated that participation in a novel pedagogy that included voluntarily individual pharmacogenomics testing was beneficial to student pharmacists by improving knowledge, interest, and confidence in pharmacogenomics and its incorporation into their future pharmacy practice.
