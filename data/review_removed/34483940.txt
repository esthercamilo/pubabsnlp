Identification of <i>EP300</i> as a Key Gene Involved in Antipsychotic-Induced Metabolic Dysregulation Based on Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis of Multi-Tissue Gene Expression Data.
Antipsychotics (APs) are associated with weight gain and other metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. This translational study aimed to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms and identify the key genes involved in AP-induced metabolic effects. An integrative gene expression analysis was performed in four different mouse tissues (striatum, liver, pancreas and adipose) after risperidone or olanzapine treatment. The analytical approach combined the identification of the gene co-expression modules related to AP treatment, gene set enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network construction. We found several co-expression modules of genes involved in glucose and lipid homeostasis, hormone regulation and other processes related to metabolic impairment. Among these genes, <i>EP300</i>, which encodes an acetyltransferase involved in transcriptional regulation, was identified as the most important hub gene overlapping the networks of both APs. Then, we explored the genetically predicted <i>EP300</i> expression levels in a cohort of 226 patients with first-episode psychosis who were being treated with APs to further assess the association of this gene with metabolic alterations. The <i>EP300</i> expression levels were significantly associated with increases in body weight, body mass index, total cholesterol levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and triglyceride concentrations after 6 months of AP treatment. Taken together, our analysis identified <i>EP300</i> as a key gene in AP-induced metabolic abnormalities, indicating that the dysregulation of <i>EP300</i> function could be important in the development of these side effects. However, more studies are needed to disentangle the role of this gene in the mechanism of action of APs.
