The Effect of Genotyping on the Number of Pharmacotherapeutic Gene-Drug Interventions in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3-5 are polypharmacy patients. Many of these drugs are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (<i>CYP450</i>) and <i>CYP450.</i> Genetic polymorphism is well known to result in altered drug metabolism capacity. This study determined the added value of pharmacogenetic testing to the routine medication evaluation in polypharmacy patients with CKD. In adult outpatient polypharmacy patients with CKD3-5 disease, a pharmacogenetic profile was determined. Then, automated medication surveillance for gene-drug interactions was performed based on the pharmacogenetic profile and the patients' current prescriptions. Of all identified gene-drug interactions, the hospital pharmacist and the treating nephrologist together assessed clinical relevance and necessity of a pharmacotherapeutic intervention. The primary endpoint of the study was the total number of applied pharmacotherapeutic interventions based on a relevant gene-drug interaction. A total of 61 patients were enrolled in the study. Medication surveillance resulted in a total of 66 gene-drug interactions, of which 26 (39%) were considered clinically relevant. This resulted in 26 applied pharmacotherapeutic interventions in 20 patients. Systematic pharmacogenetic testing enables pharmacotherapeutic interventions based on relevant gene-drug interactions. This study showed that pharmacogenetic testing adds to routine medication evaluation and could lead to optimized pharmacotherapy in CKD patients.
