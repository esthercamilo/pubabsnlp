Opinion paper on the systematic application of integrated bioinformatic tools to actuate routine precision medicine in poly-treated patients.
Precision Medicine is a reality in selected medical areas, as oncology, or in excellent healthcare structures, but it is still far to reach million patients who could benefit from this medical concept. Here, we sought to highlight how the time is ripe to achieve horizontal delivery to a significant larger audience of patients, represented by the poly-treated patients. Combination therapies are frequent (especially in the elderly, to treat comorbidities) and are related to decreased drug safety and efficacy, disease's exacerbation, additional treatments, hospitalization. But the recent development and validation of bioinformatic tools, aimed to automatic evaluation and optimization of poly-therapies, according to the unique individual characteristics (including genotype), is ready to change the daily approach to pharmacological prescription.
