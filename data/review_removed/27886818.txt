Genetic Determinants of P2Y<sub>12</sub> Inhibitors and Clinical Implications.
There is significant interpatient variability in clopidogrel effectiveness, which is due in part to cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 genotype. Approximately 30% of individuals carry CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles, which have been consistently shown to reduce clopidogrel effectiveness after an acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary intervention. Guidelines recommend consideration of prasugrel or ticagrelor in these patients. A clinical trial examining outcomes with CYP2C19 genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy is ongoing. In the meantime, based on the evidence available to date, several institutions have started clinically implementing CYP2C19 genotyping to assist with antiplatelet selection after percutaneous coronary intervention.
