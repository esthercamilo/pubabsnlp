Effect of adherence as measured by MEMS, ritonavir boosting, and CYP3A5 genotype on atazanavir pharmacokinetics in treatment-naive HIV-infected patients.
We investigated population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV), using drug intake times exactly recorded by the Medication Event Monitoring System. The ANRS 134-COPHAR 3 trial was conducted in 35 HIV-infected treatment-naive patients. ATV (300 mg), ritonavir (100 mg), and tenofovir (300 mg) + emtricitabine (200 mg), in bottles with MEMS caps, were taken once daily for 6 months. Six blood samples were collected at week 4 to measure drug concentrations, and trough levels were measured bimonthly. A model integrating ATV and ritonavir pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics used nonlinear mixed effects. Use of exact dosing data halved unexplained variability in ATV clearance. The ritonavir-ATV interaction model suggested that optimal boosting effect is achievable at lower ritonavir exposures. Patients with at least one copy of the CYP3A5*1 allele exhibited 28% higher oral clearance. We provide evidence that variability in ATV pharmacokinetics is defined by adherence, CYP3A5 genotype, and ritonavir exposure.
