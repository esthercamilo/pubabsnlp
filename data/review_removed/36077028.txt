A Longitudinal Study of the Association between the <i>LEPR</i> Polymorphism and Treatment Response in Patients with Bipolar Disorder.
Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) exhibit individual variability in the treatment outcome, and genetic background could contribute to BD itself and the treatment outcome. Leptin levels significantly change in BD patients treated with valproate (VPA), but whether <i>LEPR</i> polymorphisms are associated with treatment response is still unknown. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate the associations between <i>LEPR</i> polymorphisms and VPA treatment response in BD patients who were drug na√Øve at their first diagnosis of BD. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of <i>LEPR</i> (rs1137101, rs1137100, rs8179183, and rs12145690) were assayed, and the <i>LEPR</i> polymorphism frequencies of alleles and genotypes were not significantly different between the controls (<i>n</i> = 77) and BD patients (<i>n</i> = 130). In addition, after the 12-week course of VPA treatment in BD patients, the <i>LEPR</i> polymorphisms showed significant effects on changes in disease severity. Moreover, considering the effect of the <i>LEPR</i> haplotype, the frequency of the CAGG haplotype in BD patients was higher than that in the controls (9.3 vs. 2.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.016), and the <i>LEPR</i> CAGG haplotype was associated with a better treatment response than the other haplotypes in BD patients receiving VPA treatment. Therefore, <i>LEPR</i> polymorphisms might serve as mediators involved in the therapeutic action of VPA treatment.
