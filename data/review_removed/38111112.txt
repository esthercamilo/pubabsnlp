Pharmacogenetic Variants Can Influence Optical Medication Use.
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are used as drug susceptibility biomarkers in metabolic diseases. Alterations in the gene encoding triggers the enzyme flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), involved in the Sulindac metabolization, which also is responsible for the inherited metabolic disorder. Trimethylaminuria (TMAu, OMIM: 602079). DPYD gene variants are associated with the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency (DPD; OMIM: 274270). This autosomal recessive metabolic disorder, ultimately leads to the inability to metabolize fluoropyrimidines, which causes severe toxicity in individuals treated with these drugs.
