[The genome and pharmacology].
Pharmacogenetics is the science about how germ line mutations affect the response to drugs, and the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes has been particularly well studied during the last 25 years. The current knowledge about CYP2C9, VKORC1 and warfarin, CYP2C19 and clopidogrel, CYP2D6 and tamoxifen and CYP3A5 and tacrolimus is summarized, and it is concluded that genotyping before treatment seems to be of little practical use for all four drugs. The same applies to simvastatin and SLCOB1 and metformin and OCT1 transporter polymorphisms.
