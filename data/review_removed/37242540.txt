<i>MKX-AS1</i> Gene Expression Associated with Variation in Drug Response to Oxaliplatin and Clinical Outcomes in Colorectal Cancer Patients.
Oxaliplatin (OXAL) is a commonly used chemotherapy for treating colorectal cancer (CRC). A recent genome wide association study (GWAS) showed that a genetic variant (rs11006706) in the lncRNA gene <i>MKX-AS1</i> and partnered sense gene <i>MKX</i> could impact the response of genetically varied cell lines to OXAL treatment. This study found that the expression levels of <i>MKX-AS1</i> and <i>MKX</i> in lymphocytes (LCLs) and CRC cell lines differed between the rs11006706 genotypes, indicating that this gene pair could play a role in OXAL response. Further analysis of patient survival data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other sources showed that patients with high <i>MKX-AS1</i> expression status had significantly worse overall survival (HR = 3.2; 95%CI = (1.17-9); <i>p</i> = 0.024) compared to cases with low <i>MKX-AS1</i> expression status. Alternatively, high <i>MKX</i> expression status had significantly better overall survival (HR = 0.22; 95%CI = (0.07-0.7); <i>p</i> = 0.01) compared to cases with low <i>MKX</i> expression status. These results suggest an association between <i>MKX-AS1</i> and <i>MKX</i> expression status that could be useful as a prognostic marker of response to OXAL and potential patient outcomes in CRC.
