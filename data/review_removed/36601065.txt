<i>CYP2C19</i> metabolizer phenotypes may affect the efficacy of statins on lowering small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of patients with coronary artery disease.
Dyslipidemia is a major cause of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the profile to be reduced to prevent disease progression. Small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sdLDL-C) has been proven to be a more effective biomarker than LDL-C for ASCVD primary and secondary prevention. <i>CYP2C19</i> is an important drug metabolism gene. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between sdLDL-C and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors and explore the influence of <i>CYP2C19</i> metabolizer phenotypes on the sdLDL-C lowering efficacy of statins.
