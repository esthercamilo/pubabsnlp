Pharmacogenetic Variation in Over 100 Genes in Patients Receiving Acenocumarol.
Coumarins are widely prescribed worldwide, and in Mexico acenocumarol is the preferred form. It is well known that despite its efficacy, coumarins show a high variability for dose requirements. We investigated the pharmacogenetic variation of 110 genes in patients receiving acenocumarol using a targeted NGS approach. We report relevant population differentiation for variants on <i>CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP4F11, CYP4F2, PROS</i>, and <i>GGCX, VKORC1, CYP2C18, NQO1</i>. A higher proportion of novel-to-known variants for 10 genes was identified on 41 core pharmacogenomics genes related to the PK (29), PD (3), of coumarins, and coagulation proteins (9) including, <i>CYP1A1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5</i>, and <i>F8</i>, and a low proportion of novel-to-known variants on <i>CYP2E1, VKORC1</i>, and <i>SULT1A1/2</i>. Using a Bayesian approach, we identified variants influencing acenocumarol dosing on, <i>VKORC1 (2), SULT1A1 (1)</i>, and <i>CYP2D8P (1)</i> explaining 40-55% of dose variability. A collection of pharmacogenetic variation on 110 genes related to the PK/PD of coumarins is also presented. Our results offer an initial insight into the use of a targeted NGS approach in the pharmacogenomics of coumarins in Mexican Mestizos.
