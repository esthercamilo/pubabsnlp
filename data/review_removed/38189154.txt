Association between <i>CYP3A4</i>, <i>CYP3A5</i> and <i>ABCB1</i> genotype and tacrolimus treatment outcomes among allogeneic HSCT patients.
<b>Aim:</b> Successful treatment with tacrolimus to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD) and minimize tacrolimus-related toxicities among allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) recipients is contingent upon quickly achieving and maintaining concentrations within a narrow therapeutic range. The primary objective was to investigate associations between <i>CYP3A4, CYP3A5</i> or <i>ABCB1</i> genotype and the proportion of patients that attained an initial tacrolimus goal concentration following initiation of intravenous (iv.) and conversion to oral administration. <b>Materials & methods:</b> We retrospectively evaluated 86 patients who underwent HLA-matched (8/8) related donor alloHCT and were prescribed a tacrolimus-based regimen for GVHD prophylaxis. <b>Results & conclusion:</b> The findings of the present study suggests that <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype may impact attainment of initial therapeutic tacrolimus concentrations with oral administration in alloHCT recipients.
