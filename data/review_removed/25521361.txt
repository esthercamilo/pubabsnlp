Pharmacogenetics of inflammatory bowel disease.
Pharmacogenetic studies have been performed for almost all classes of drugs that have been used in IBD but very few have generated consistent findings or have been replicated. The genetic test that has been approved for clinical practice is TPMT testing prior to starting treatment with thiopurine drugs. Research in IBD pharmacogenetics has focused on prediction of drug efficacy and toxicity by identifying polymorphisms in the genes encoding enzymes that are involved in metabolic pathways. Recent research has mainly focused on therapeutic agents such as azathioprine, methotrexate, aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, infliximab and adalimumab. Future pharmaceutical trials should include pharmacogenetic research to test appropriate candidate genes in a prospective manner and correlate genetic associations with trial outcomes and relevant functional data.
