CYP2C9*3 Increases the Ibuprofen Response of Hemodynamically Significant Patent Ductus Arteriosus in the Infants with Gestational Age of More Than 30 Weeks.
Hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA) is a severe condition in newborns. Ibuprofen is an effective treatment to reduce the severe complications and the need for surgical treatment. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were related to the ibuprofen metabolism, treatment effects, and the onset of side effects. The effects of SNPs on hsPDA response after ibuprofen treatment are unknown. Therefore, in this study, we recruited hsPDA patients with standard ibuprofen treatment. Those patients had participated in China Neonatal Genomes Project (CNGP, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03931707) with next-generation sequencing data. We reanalyzed the sequencing data and compared the allele frequencies of known ibuprofen-related SNPs between ibuprofen Responder and Non-responder groups. In total, 185 hsPDA patients were recruited with gestational age (GA) ranging from 24 to 40 weeks. No significant differences were detected in the basic information, period of ibuprofen treatment, rate of conservative treatment, complications, and side effects between ibuprofen Responder group and Non-responder group. Totally, 17 hsPDA carried CYP2C9*3 and one with CYP2C9*2 were detected. In the GA group of more than 30 GA weeks (GA > 30 wks group), we found higher allele frequency of CYP2C9*3 in Responder group than in Non-responder group (16% vs. 0, <i>p</i> = 0.0391). In the GA group of less than 30 GA weeks (GA ≤ 30 wks group), the sum allele frequency of CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C9*2 had no stastical difference between two groups (Responder group vs. Non-responder group, 13% vs. 11%, <i>p</i> = 0.768). Therefore, we came to conclude that genetic tests of CYP2C9*3 site may benefit the prediction of ibuprofen treatment outcome for hsPDA patients with gestational age of more than 30 weeks.
