4th ESPT summer school: precision medicine and personalised health.
In September 2018, the European Society of Pharmacogenomics and Personalised Therapy (ESPT), with the support of the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN), organized its 4th biennial summer school, entitled 'Precision Medicine and Personalised Health' (Campus Biotech, Geneva, Switzerland; www.esptsummerschool.eu/ ). The school's comprehensive and innovative educational program aimed to address the fundamentals of pharmacogenomics, the latest knowledge on established and new concepts in the field of precision medicine, as well as its advanced clinical applications in personalized health. The school consisted of 31 lectures, eight interactive workshops, visits to genome center and poster presentations, involving 40 speakers from distinguished international faculties. The meeting was a resounding success by generating informal environments between more than 80 participants from 26 different countries.
