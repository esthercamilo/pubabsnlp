Clinical application of pharmacogenomics: the example of HLA-based drug-induced toxicity.
Pharmacogenomics is gradually becoming more and more indispensable in modern medicine. In several cases, a pharmacogenomics test may alleviate serious drug-induced adverse reactions, if it precedes drug prescription. In this article, we provide an overview of the well-established HLA-based carbamazepine- and allopurinol-induced adverse reactions, as one of the most characteristic examples of the clinical application of pharmacogenomics, highlighting its regional impact in Southeast Asian populations in preventing adverse reactions of certain drug/allele pairs. This example provides useful insights towards evidence generation for policy implementation, including economic evaluation analysis, the implementation of pharmacogenomics testing procedures and monitoring of policy effectiveness, hence serving, per se or in the context of international collaborative efforts, as a model for similar cases in several national healthcare systems worldwide.
