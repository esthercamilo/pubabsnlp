Diagnostic and Therapeutic Strategies for Fluoropyrimidine Treatment of Patients Carrying Multiple DPYD Variants.
<i>DPYD</i> genotyping prior to fluoropyrimidine treatment is increasingly implemented in clinical care. Without phasing information (i.e., allelic location of variants), current genotype-based dosing guidelines cannot be applied to patients carrying multiple <i>DPYD</i> variants. The primary aim of this study is to examine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for fluoropyrimidine treatment of patients carrying multiple <i>DPYD</i> variants. A case series of patients carrying multiple <i>DPYD</i> variants is presented. Different genotyping techniques were used to determine phasing information. Phenotyping was performed by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme activity measurements. Publicly available databases were queried to explore the frequency and phasing of variants of patients carrying multiple <i>DPYD</i> variants. Four out of seven patients carrying multiple <i>DPYD</i> variants received a full dose of fluoropyrimidines and experienced severe toxicity. Phasing information could be retrieved for four patients. In three patients, variants were located on two different alleles, i.e., in <i>trans</i>. Recommended dose reductions based on the phased genotype differed from the phenotype-derived dose reductions in three out of four cases. Data from publicly available databases show that the frequency of patients carrying multiple <i>DPYD</i> variants is low (< 0.2%), but higher than the frequency of the commonly tested <i>DPYD</i>*13 variant (0.1%). Patients carrying multiple <i>DPYD</i> variants are at high risk of developing severe toxicity. Additional analyses are required to determine the correct dose of fluoropyrimidine treatment. In patients carrying multiple <i>DPYD</i> variants, we recommend that a DPD phenotyping assay be carried out to determine a safe starting dose.
