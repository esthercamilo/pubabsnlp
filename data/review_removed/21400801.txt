[Pharmacogenetical aspects of clinical anaesthesiology].
This survey of literature highlights the issues of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics, the nomenclature of polymorphisms and the major clinically significant polymorphisms for the classes of medications which are most widespread in clinical anaesthesia. 53 data sources has been analyzed, including the polymorphism data base of National Center for Biotechnological Information (USA). Nowadays, choosing a medication do not provide for a individual genetic variability. It is possible that some of the drugs are potent to cause severe adverse effects or ineffective in certain subclasses of population due to unfavourable effectiveness/toxicity ratio. As the technology is developing, it is possible in future to treat every genetic subpopulation with a specific medication in order to obtain a target effect. Perhaps, it is too early to expect some immediate results of pharmacogenetics for a daily practice in anaesthesia. Nevertheless, it is possible that progress in genomics will enable a better understanding of those single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes which alter the response to a medication. Those future discoveries will enable the targeting of the anaesthesia medications and personalization of the anaesthesia strategy aimed at improving the surgery outcomes as well as treating the acute and chronic pain according to a genetic profile of the patient.
