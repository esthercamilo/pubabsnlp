Evaluation of the iPLEX® ADME PGx Pro Panel and allele frequencies of pharmacogenetic markers in Danes.
The iPlex® ADME PGx Pro Panel was developed to investigate 191 polymorphisms including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion-deletions (INDELS), and copy number variations (CNV) relevant for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of drugs. The purpose of this study was to perform a technical evaluation of the iPlex® ADME PGx Pro Panel by genotyping 50 unrelated Danes and estimate preliminary genotype frequencies among Danes.
