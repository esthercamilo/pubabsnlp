Impact of incorporating ABCB1 and CYP4F2 polymorphisms in a pharmacogenetics-guided warfarin dosing algorithm for the Brazilian population.
Interpatient variation of warfarin dose requirements may be explained by genetic variations and general and clinical factors. In this scenario, diverse population-calibrated dosing algorithms, which incorporate the main warfarin dosing influencers, have been widely proposed for predicting supposed warfarin maintenance dose, in order to prevent and reduce adverse events. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of the inclusion of ABCB1 c.3435C>T and CYP4F2 c.1297G>A polymorphisms as additional covariates in a previously developed pharmacogenetic-based warfarin dosing algorithm calibrated for the Brazilian population.
