Chemotherapeutic-induced apoptosis: a phenotype for pharmacogenomics studies.
To determine whether cellular apoptosis is a suitable phenotypic trait for pharmacogenomics studies by evaluating caspase 3/7-mediated activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines after treatment with six chemotherapeutic agents: 5'-deoxyfluorouridine, pemetrexed, cytarabine, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cisplatin.
