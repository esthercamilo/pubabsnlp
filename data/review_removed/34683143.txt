Impact of Tacrolimus Daily Dose Limitation in Renal Transplant Recipients Expressing CYP3A5: A Retrospective Study.
The pharmacokinetic variability of tacrolimus can be partly explained by CYP3A5 activity. Our objective was to evaluate a tacrolimus sparing policy on renal graft outcome according to <i>CYP3A5</i> 6986A>G genetic polymorphism. This retrospective study included 1114 recipients with a median follow-up of 6.3 years. Genotyping of the 6986A>G allelic variant corresponding to <i>CYP3A5*3</i> was systematically performed. One year after transplantation, tacrolimus blood trough concentration (C0) target range was 5-7 ng/mL. However, daily dose was capped to 0.10 mg/kg/day regardless of the <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype. A total 208 <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients were included. Despite a higher daily dose, <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients exhibited lower C0 during follow-up (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Multivariate analysis did not show any significant influence of <i>CYP3A5*1</i>/- genotype (HR = 0.70, 0.46-1.07, <i>p</i> = 0.10) on patient-graft survival. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline was significantly lower for the <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> group (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> genotype did not significantly impact the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) (HR = 1.01, 0.68-1.49, <i>p</i> = 0.97) despite significantly lower C0. Based on our experience, a strategy of tacrolimus capping is associated with a better GFR evolution in <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> recipients without any significant increase of BPAR incidence. Our study raised some issues about specific therapeutic tacrolimus C0 targets for <i>CYP3A5*1/-</i> patients and suggests to set up randomized control studies in this specific population.
