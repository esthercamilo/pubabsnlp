Role and implications of nanodiagnostics in the changing trends of clinical diagnosis.
Nanodiagnostics is the term used for the application of nanobiotechnology in molecular diagnosis, which is important for developing personalized cancer therapy. It is usually based on pharmacogenetics, pharmacogenomics, and pharmacoproteomic information but also takes into consideration environmental factors that influence response to therapy. Nanotechnology in medicine involves applications of nanoparticles currently under development, as well as longer range research that involves the use of manufactured nano-robots to make repairs at the cellular level. Nanodiagnostic technologies are also being used to refine the discovery of biomarkers, as nanoparticles offer advantages of high volume/surface ratio and multifunctionality. Biomarkers are important basic components of personalized medicine and are applicable to the management of cancer as well. The field of nano diagnostics raises certain ethical concerns related with the testing of blood. With advances in diagnostic technologies, doctors will be able to give patients complete health checks quickly and routinely. If any medication is required this will be tailored specifically to the individual based on their genetic makeup, thus preventing unwanted side-effects.
