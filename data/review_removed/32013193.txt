Influence of Germline Genetics on Tacrolimus Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Patients.
Tacrolimus exhibits high inter-patient pharmacokinetics (PK) variability, as well as a narrow therapeutic index, and therefore requires therapeutic drug monitoring. Germline mutations in cytochrome P450 isoforms 4 and 5 genes (<i>CYP3A4/5</i>) and the ATP-binding cassette B1 gene (<i>ABCB1</i>) may contribute to interindividual tacrolimus PK variability, which may impact clinical outcomes among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients. In this study, 252 adult patients who received tacrolimus for acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis after allogeneic HSCT were genotyped to evaluate if germline genetic variants associated with tacrolimus PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) variability. Significant associations were detected between germline variants in <i>CYP3A4/5</i> and <i>ABCB1</i> and PK endpoints (e.g., median steady-state tacrolimus concentrations and time to goal tacrolimus concentration). However, significant associations were not observed between <i>CYP3A4/5</i> or <i>ABCB1</i> germline variants and PD endpoints (e.g., aGVHD and treatment-emergent nephrotoxicity). Decreased age and <i>CYP3A5*1/*1</i> genotype were independently associated with subtherapeutic tacrolimus trough concentrations while <i>CYP3A5*1*3</i> or <i>CYP3A5*3/*3</i> genotypes, myeloablative allogeneic HSCT conditioning regimen (MAC) and increased weight were independently associated with supratherapeutic tacrolimus trough concentrations. Future lines of prospective research inquiry are warranted to use both germline genetic and clinical data to develop precision dosing tools that will optimize both tacrolimus dosing and clinical outcomes among adult HSCT patients.
