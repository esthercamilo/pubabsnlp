The role of direct oral anticoagulants in the era of COVID-19: are antiviral therapy and pharmacogenetics limiting factors?
In patients with COVID-19, thromboinflammation is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality, which makes anticoagulation an integral part of treatment. However, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) limit the use of this class of anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients due to a significant interference with antiviral agents. DOACs use in COVID-19 hospitalized patients is currently not recommended. Furthermore, patients already on oral anticoagulant drugs should be switched to heparin at hospital admission. Nevertheless, outpatients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are recommended to continue prior DOAC therapy. More studies are required to clarify the pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced derangement of the coagulation system in order to recommend an appropriate anticoagulant treatment.
