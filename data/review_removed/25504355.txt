Ethical perspectives on translational pharmacogenetic research involving children.
Children represent a special population characterized by dynamic changes which may affect drug safety and efficacy. The interplay of pharmacogenetics with physiological alterations that occur throughout development is an area of increasing research focus. Given the translational nature of pharmacogenetic research, it is possible that pharmacogenetic research results may possess clinically actionable information. The potential long-term implications of pharmacogenetic test results throughout the lifespan of the child, and the potential impact of the results for other members of the family need to be considered. Comprehensive counselling and communication strategies may need to be integrated as part of pharmacogenetic research studies in children.
