Identification and characterization of a 25-lncRNA prognostic signature for early recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma.
Early recurrence is the major cause of poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are deeply involved in HCC prognosis. In this study, we aimed to establish a prognostic lncRNA signature for HCC early recurrence.
