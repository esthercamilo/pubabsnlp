The Efficacies and Toxicities of Antidepressant Drugs in Clinics, Building the Relationship between Chemo-Genetics and Socio-Environments.
Antidepressants generally relief human depressive symptoms and help depressed people. Nevertheless, some undesired clinical events, such as suicide have been emerging more recently. In order to improve and promote antidepressant utilizations in clinics, new researches are focusing on reevaluation of the relationship between efficacy and toxicities of antidepressants in China and US. These researches speed up quickly. Many creative ideas and discoveries have been made, including predictions of the efficacies and toxicities of antidepressants under the same evaluating systems (pharmacogenetics and bioinformatics), genome-wide associate study (GWAS) of the relationship between individual genetic factors and therapeutic outcomes of different types of antidepressants and socio-environmental factors. Hopefully, therapeutic efficacies and outcomes by different types of antidepressant treatments for patients can be improved in clinical trials in the near future.
