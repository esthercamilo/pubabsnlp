Pharmacogenetics and Personalized Medicine in Pancreatic Cancer.
 Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a progressive, fatal disease with a high degree of malignancy. More than 40000 peoplediefrom this cancer annually in the United States. As a multifactorial condition, PC has a complex nature, and there are several genes and signalingpathwaysimplicated in PC pathogenesis and progression. There are diffèrent mutations in master genesincludingtumorsuppressors and oncogenesthat lead to Pancreaticintraepithelialneoplasia (PanIN) whichis the mostcommon non-invasive precursorlesion of pancreatic cancer. These mutations influence directly or indirectly the cycle of Pharmacodynamics profile. Interactions between genetics and drug metabolism could be considered as one of the most important insights in the personalized medicine and targeted therapy based on the genetic profile of each affected person. In this literature, we will discuss pathogenesis and susceptibility to PC, pharmacogenetics and personalized medicine in pancreatic cancer and scrutinized the most important genes, variations and signaling pathways that influence individualized therapy of PC.
