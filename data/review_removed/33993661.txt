[Patient age and CYP2D6*4/CYP2D6*3 genotype on maximal heart rate in patients after acute coronary syndrome treated with bisoprolol.].
We have analyzed influence of genetic variants CYP2D6*3 (2549delA) and CYP2D6*4 (1846G>A), as well as other factors on effects of bisoprolol in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The study included 97 patients with acute coronary syndrome. Mean age was 63±10 years; 60 men and 37 women. We have found association between carriage of CYP2D6*4 (1846G>A) and maximal heart rate at exertion (R-0,21; р<0,05). When the correction for potential confounders was made, age was the only significant predictor of maximal heart rate (β=0,6; SE=0,07; p<0,001). At the same time it was found that CYP2D6*4 was associated with more advanced age of the patients (r=0,2; p<0,05).
