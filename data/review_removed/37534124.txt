The impact of anti-seizure medications on psychiatric disorders among children with epilepsy: Both a challenge and an opportunity?
Psychiatric disorders are common co-existing conditions in children with epilepsy and can precede or follow epilepsy onset. Therefore, when selecting anti-seizure medications (ASMs) for children with epilepsy, in addition to seizure control, careful consideration of behavioral and psychotropic effects (BPEs) is critical, as they can have a negative impact on ASM adherence and quality of life. The goal in supporting children with epilepsy is an individualized approach to maximize seizure control and minimize negative BPEs. A previous history of a psychiatric disorder is the most significant risk factor for negative BPEs. Therefore, systematic screening for psychiatric symptoms can guide ASM selection and prompt intervention as needed. Besides familiarity with different ASM profiles, awareness of risk factors for negative BPEs including rapid dose titrations and weaning schedules, polypharmacy, high ASM doses, and drug interactions are important. In children with co-existing psychiatric disorders, ASMs with mood stabilizing, behavior regulating or anxiolytic properties may be preferred choices. Overall, a comprehensive and coordinated approach, with family psychoeducation and a mutual understanding of clinical aspects between the disciplines of neurology and psychiatry will enable better outcomes in children with epilepsy. Further pediatric "real-world" studies will expand knowledge of BPEs and potential risk factors. For some children, timely epilepsy surgery or precision therapies targeting a pathological defect may reduce the ASM burden in a child's life and subsequent BPEs. The ability to predict an individual child's susceptibility to negative BPEs with valid biomarkers may become available in the near future with advances in pharmacogenomics and technology.
