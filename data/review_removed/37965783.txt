Pre-emptive pharmacogenomics implementation among polypharmacy patients 65Â years old and older: a clinical pilot.
<b>Aim:</b> Pre-emptive testing of pharmacogenomic (PGx) variations has potential to improve medication safety and effectiveness; however, testing is not routine. Given the newfound payor coverage of multigene testing and the potential value of testing within aging patients, it is imperative to test local PGx testing capabilities, report results to patients and providers, and determine the value of testing. <b>Materials & methods:</b> We designed a randomized clinical pilot of a pre-emptive PGx testing process using the electronic health record compared with usual care among an aging primary care population. <b>Results & conclusion:</b> The impact of the program on prescribing patterns, healthcare utilization and costs of care will be evaluated. We hypothesize that implementation of a pre-emptive multigene PGx panel is feasible among elderly, polypharmacy, primary care patients, measured by the number of enrolled patients with PGx results entered in the medical record. Health system wide PGx implementation, including capacity needed to integrate these valuable results, is also described.
