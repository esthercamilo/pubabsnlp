Acceptability of Pharmacogenetic Testing among French Psychiatrists, a National Survey.
Psychiatric disorder management is based on the prescription of psychotropic drugs. Response to them remains often insufficient and varies from one patient to another. Pharmacogenetics explain part of this variability. Pharmacogenetic testing is likely to optimize the choice of treatment and thus improve patients' care, even if concerns and limitations persist. This practice of personalized medicine is not very widespread in France. We conducted a national survey to evaluate the acceptability of this tool by psychiatrists and psychiatry residents in France, and to identify factors associated with acceptability and previous use. The analysis included 397 observations. The mean acceptability score was 10.70, on a scale from 4 to 16. Overall acceptability score was considered as low for 3.0% of responders, intermediate for 80.1% and high for 16.9%. After regression, the remaining factors influencing acceptability independently of the others were prescription and training history and theoretical approach. The attitude of our population seems to be rather favorable, however, obvious deficiencies have emerged regarding perceived skills and received training. Concerns about the cost and delays of tests results also emerged. According to our survey, one of the keys to overcoming the barriers encountered in the integration of pharmacogenetics seems to be the improvement of training and the provision of information to practitioners.
