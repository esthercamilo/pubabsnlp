Gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase genetic polymorphism is a candidate locus for responsiveness to opioid analgesics in patients with cancer pain: An exploratory study.
Cancer pain impairs not only physical functions but also social functions and roles. Consequently, the overall health-related quality of life of patients with cancer pain deteriorates. Opioid analgesics are recommended for treating moderate to strong cancer pain. Advances in human genome research have fueled a growing interest to understand individual differences in responsiveness to opioid analgesics. This study aimed to explore and identify novel loci for genes predisposing an individual to opioid analgesic responsiveness.
