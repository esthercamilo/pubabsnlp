Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacogenetic Study of Etoposide in High-Dose Protocol (TI-CE) for Advanced Germ Cell Tumors.
Etoposide dosing is based on body surface area. We evaluated if further dose individualization would be required for high dose (HD) etoposide within the TI-CE (taxol, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) protocol.
