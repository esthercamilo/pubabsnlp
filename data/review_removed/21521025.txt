Matrix metalloproteinase pharmacogenomics in non-small-cell lung carcinoma.
Non-small-cell lung carcinoma demonstrated considerable variability in its chemoresponse. However, the prospect of individualized medicine holds high hopes for improving patient survival. The study of tumor and patient genetic profiles, relative to drug-related genes, may offer new opportunities for tailoring treatments. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-containing endopeptidases, which degrade the extracellular matrix and basement membrane, and process bioactive mediators involved in promoting aspects of tumor growth. Polymorphisms in MMP genes known to influence the protein-expression patterns has been shown to influence therapy outcomes by altering signaling pathways. In this article, we address the polymorphic association of MMPs in response to chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Advances in genome technology and their comprehensive and systematic deployment to elucidate the genomic basis of MMP differences promise to ultimately enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy while reducing its toxicity for the treatment of various cancers.
