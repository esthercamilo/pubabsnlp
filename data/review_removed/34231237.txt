Structural and functional insights on vitamin D receptor and CYP24A1 deleterious single nucleotide polymorphisms: A computational and pharmacogenomics perpetual approach.
The development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) drugs remains a challenge due to the variations in the genes. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Cytochrome 24A1 (CYP24A1) genetic variants might affect the drug potency, efficacy and pathway. Here we have to analyse and determine the deleterious single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) of VDR and CYP24A1 genes and their different population's drug responses in different populations to understand the key role in CKD. Among that the large scale of nsSNP, we used certain computational tools that predicted six missense variants are observed to be significantly damaging effect and SNP variability with large differences in various populations. Molecular docking studies were carried out by clinical and our screened compounds to VDR and CYP24A1. Docking results revealed all the compounds have a good binding affinity (Score). The screened compounds (TCM_2868 and UNPD_141613) show good binding affinity when compared to known compounds. The QM/MM study revealed that the compounds have electron transfer ability and act as a donor/acceptor to mutated proteins. The structural and conformational changes of protein complexes were analysed by molecular dynamics study. Hence, this study helps to identify suitable drugs through drug discovery in CKD treatment. The abovementioned compounds have more binding affinity, efficacy, and potency of both wild and mutant of VDR and CYP24A1.
