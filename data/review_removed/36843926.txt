Bioaccumulation and biotransformation of simvastatin in probiotic bacteria: A step towards better understanding of drug-bile acids-microbiome interactions.
<b>Introduction:</b> Although pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics have been at the forefront of research aimed at finding novel personalized therapies, the focus of research has recently extended to the potential of intestinal microbiota to affect drug efficacy. Complex interplay of gut microbiota with bile acids may have significant repercussions on drug pharmacokinetics. However, far too little attention has been paid to the potential implication of gut microbiota and bile acids in simvastatin response which is characterized by large interindividual variations. <b>The Aim:</b> In order to gain more insight into the underlying mechanism and its contribution in assessing the clinical outcome, the aim of our study was to examine simvastatin bioaccumulation and biotransformation in probiotic bacteria and the effect of bile acids on simvastatin bioaccumulation in <i>in vitro</i> conditions. <b>Materials and methods:</b> Samples with simvastatin, probiotic bacteria and three different bile acids were incubated at anaerobic conditions at 37°C for 24 h. Extracellular and intracellular medium samples were collected and prepared for the LC-MS analysis at predetermined time points (0 min, 15 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 24 h). The concentrations of simvastatin were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Potential biotransformation pathways were analyzed using a bioinformatics approach in correlation with experimental assay. <b>Results:</b> During the incubation, simvastatin was transported into bacteria cells leading to a drug bioaccumulation over the time, which was augmented upon addition of bile acids after 24 h. A decrease of total drug level during the incubation indicates that the drug is partly biotransformed by bacterial enzymes. According to the results of bioinformatics analysis, the lactone ring is the most susceptible to metabolic changes and the most likely reactions include ester hydrolysis followed by hydroxylation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Results of our study reveal that bioaccumulation and biotransformation of simvastatin by intestinal bacteria might be the underlying mechanisms of altered simvastatin bioavailability and therapeutic effect. Since this study is based only on selected bacterial strains <i>in vitro</i>, further more in-depth research is needed in order to elicit completely the contribution of complex drug-microbiota-bile acids interactions to overall clinical response of simvastatin which could ultimately lead to novel approaches for the personalized lipid-lowering therapy.
