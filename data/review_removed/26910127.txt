Advances in understanding genomic markers and pharmacogenetics of Parkinson's disease.
The inheritance pattern of Parkinson's disease (PD) is likely multifactorial (owing to the interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental factors). Many pharmacogenetic studies have tried to establish a possible role of candidate genes in PD risk. Several studies have focused on the influence of genes in the response to antiparkinsonian drugs and in the risk of developing side-effects of these drugs.
