Severe systemic adverse reactions to ophthalmic timolol in a <i>CYP2D6</i> homozygous <i>*4</i> allele carrier: a case report.
A woman with ocular hypertension suffered from severe bradycardia, hypotension and syncope attacks in temporal relation with ophthalmic timolol application. Topically applied timolol is nasally absorbed and has been shown to reach potentially relevant systemic concentrations. Timolol is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6, which exhibits interindividual metabolic capacity due to genetic variations. A reactive pharmacogenetic panel test identified the patient as a <i>CYP2D6</i> homozygous <i>*4</i> allele carrier, which has been associated with a poor metabolizer phenotype and lacking enzyme activity. Thus, the adverse drug reactions possibly resulted from increased systemic timolol exposure. This case report highlights that pharmacogenetic panel testing can contribute to safe and effective pharmacotherapy, even for topically applied drugs.
