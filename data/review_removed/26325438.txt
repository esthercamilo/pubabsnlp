Influence of Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Genomic Variants on Tacrolimus/Sirolimus Blood Levels and Graft-versus-Host Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.
Allelic variants of genes implicated in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) determine the pharmacokinetic variability of many medications and are increasingly recognized as important factors determining the success or failure of medical treatments. Both tacrolimus and sirolimus have narrow therapeutic ranges maintained by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Using an ADME panel that covers >99% of the PharmaADME working group core list (188 single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] and 12 copy number variant [CNV] assays in 36 pharmacogenetically relevant genes), we studied 177 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using tacrolimus/sirolimus-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. We tested for possible associations between ADME variants and tacrolimus/sirolimus drug levels, concentration/dose (C/D) ratio, and clinical endpoints, including acute GVHD. A total of 62 SNP and 6 CNV assays were evaluable after removing the variants, which were homozygous in (nearly) all samples. For sirolimus, rs2032582 (ABCB1) T-carriers versus non-T-carriers were associated with higher blood levels (P = .01), with similar results for C/D ratio. Generalized estimating equation analysis supported these findings. For tacrolimus, rs776746 CYP3A5*3/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*1 were associated with higher blood levels than CYP3A5*1/*1 (P = .002). By multivariable analysis, rs776746 CYP3A5*3/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*1 were independently associated with decreased acute GVHD compared with CYP3A5*1/*1, after adjustment for conditioning, donor type, race/ethnicity, and age. We demonstrated association of specific ADME genetic polymorphisms with blood levels of tacrolimus/sirolimus, and incidence of acute GVHD after HCT, in spite of TDM and dose adjustment. A larger ongoing study will determine whether these associations have clinical utility beyond TDM.
