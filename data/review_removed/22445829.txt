High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms in microRNA target sites.
The function of microRNAs (miRNAs) depends on the binding of miRNAs to their target sequences in the 3'UTR of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which enhances the degradation of mRNAs and consequently, represses their expression. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miRNA target sequences may affect or impair the binding of miRNAs. Studies have shown that SNPs in miRNA target sites (miR-TS-SNPs) have a great influence on diverse biological functions, including pharmacogenomics and disease susceptibilities in human.
