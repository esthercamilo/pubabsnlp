Multi-institutional Study of Outcomes After Pediatric Heart Transplantation: Candidate Gene Polymorphism Analysis of ABCC2.
Earlier studies have indicated that the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolic acid (MPA) is influenced by polymorphisms of ABCC2, which encodes for the membrane transporter MRP2. The ABCC2 rs717620 A allele has been associated with enterohepatic recirculation of MPA, and our previous work had correlated the discontinuance of MPA with this allele in pediatric heart transplant patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ABCC2 rs717620 A allele would be associated with poorer outcomes including rejection with hemodynamic compromise (RHC), graft failure, and death in the pediatric heart transplant (PHTx) population receiving MPA.
