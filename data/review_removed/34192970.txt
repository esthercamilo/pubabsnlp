A novel single-tube multiplex real-time PCR assay for genotyping of thiopurine intolerance-causing variant <i>NUDT15</i> c.415C>T.
Thiopurines are commonly used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and autoimmune conditions, can be limited by myelosuppression. The <i>NUDT15</i> c.415C>T variant is strongly associated with thiopurine-induced myelosuppression, especially in Asians. The purpose of this study was to develop a fast and reliable genotyping method for <i>NUDT15</i> c.415C>T and investigate the polymorphic distribution among different races in China. A single-tube multiplex real-time PCR assay for <i>NUDT15</i> c.415C>T genotyping was established using allele-specific TaqMan probes. In 229 samples, the genotyping results obtained through the established method were completely concordant with those obtained by Sanger sequencing. The distributions of <i>NUDT15</i> c.415C>T among 173 Han Chinese, 48 Miaos, 40 Kazakhs, and 40 Kirghiz were different, with allelic frequencies of 0.06, 0.02, 0.07, and 0, respectively. This method will provide a powerful tool for the implementation of the genotyping-based personalized prescription of thiopurines in clinical settings.
