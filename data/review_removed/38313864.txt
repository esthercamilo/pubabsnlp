Patients' Experiences of a Precision Medicine Clinic.
The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of patients' experiences using a precision medicine (PM) clinic that conducts pharmacogenomics-based (PGx) testing for adverse drug reactions. The study aimed to identify the features of the clinic valued most by patients and areas for improvement. A paper survey was used to collect data. Survey questions focused on patients' perceptions of the PM testing and the overall clinic experience. Sixty-seven patients completed the survey. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS and frequencies were reported. Open-ended responses were coded and organized thematically. Patients reported that the clinic services increased confidence in their medication usage. Feeling respected by staff, receiving education, and quick appointments were highly valued by patients. Suggested areas for improvement included better communication from the clinic to patients, expansion of clinic services, and education for other healthcare providers. The findings demonstrate that patient experience goes beyond the clinical care provided. Current and potential future providers of PM should invest the time and energy to configure their care delivery system to enhance the patient experience.
