Genetic Contributors of Efficacy and Adverse Metabolic Effects of Chlorthalidone in African Americans from the Genetics of Hypertension Associated Treatments (GenHAT) Study.
Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality. African Americans (AAs) have the highest prevalence of hypertension in the United States, and to alleviate the burden of hypertension in this population, better control of blood pressure (BP) is needed. Previous studies have shown considerable interpersonal differences in BP response to antihypertensive treatment, suggesting a genetic component. Utilizing data from 4297 AA participants randomized to chlorthalidone from the Genetics of Hypertension Associated Treatments (GenHAT) study, we aimed to identify variants associated with the efficacy of chlorthalidone. An additional aim was to find variants that contributed to changes in fasting glucose (FG) in these individuals. We performed genome-wide association analyses on the change of systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) over six months and FG levels over 24 months of treatment. We sought replication in the International Consortia of Pharmacogenomics Studies. We identified eight variants statistically associated with BP response and nine variants associated with FG response. One suggestive <i>LINC02211-CDH9</i> intergenic variant was marginally replicated with the same direction of effect. Given the impact of hypertension in AAs, this study implies that understanding the genetic background for BP control and glucose changes during chlorthalidone treatment may help prevent adverse cardiovascular events in this population.
