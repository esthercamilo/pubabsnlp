A genome-wide association study of antidepressant-induced mania.
Antidepressant-induced mania (AIM) is a side effect of antidepressant treatment that is characterized by mania or hypomania after the start of medication. It is likely polygenic, but its genetic component remains largely unexplored. We aim to conduct the first genome-wide association study of AIM in 814 bipolar disorder patients of European ancestry. We report no significant findings from our single-marker or gene-based analyses. Our polygenic risk score analyses also did not yield significant results with bipolar disorder, antidepressant response, or lithium response. Our suggestive findings on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the opioid system in AIM require independent replications.
