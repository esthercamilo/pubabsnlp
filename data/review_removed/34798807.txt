Genetic analysis of pharmacogenomic VIP variants in the Wa population from Yunnan Province of China.
The variation of drug responses and target does among individuals is mostly determined by genes. With the development of pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics, the differences in drug response between different races seem to be mainly caused by the genetic diversity of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics genes. Very important pharmacogenetic (VIP) variants mean that genes or variants play important and vital roles in drug response, which have been listed in pharmacogenomics databases, such as Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB). The information of Chinese ethnic minorities such as the Wa ethnic group is scarce. This study aimed to uncover the significantly different loci in the Wa population in Yunnan Province of China from the perspective of pharmacogenomics, to provide a theoretical basis for the future medication guidance, and to ultimately achieve the best treatment in the future.
