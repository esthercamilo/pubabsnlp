Conference report: pharmacogenomics in special populations at WCP2018.
The 18th World Congress of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (WCP2018), coordinated by IUPHAR and hosted by the Japanese Pharmacological Society and the Japanese Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, was held in July 2018 at the Kyoto International Conference Center, in Kyoto, Japan. Having as its main theme 'Pharmacology for the Future: Science, Drug Development and Therapeutics', WCP2018 was attended by over 4500 delegates, representing 78 countries. The present report is an overview of a symposium at WCP2018, entitled Pharmacogenomics in Special Populations, organized by IUPHARÂ´s Pharmacogenetics/Genomics (PGx) section. The PGx section congregates distinguished scientists from different continents, covering expertise from basic research, to clinical implementation and ethical aspects of PGx, and one of its major activities is the coordination of symposia and workshops to foster exchange of PGx knowledge (https://iuphar.org/sections-subcoms/pharmacogenetics-genomics/). The symposium attracted a large audience to listen to presentations covering various areas of research and clinical adoption of PGx in Oceania, Africa, Latin America and Asia.
