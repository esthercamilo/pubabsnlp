Results of the implementation of a pharmacogenomics platform based on NGS technologies. Combining clinical and research approaches.
As more genes are incorporated into pharmacogenomic care  processes and more importance is given to rare variants, the use of targeted  capture sequencing panels has been proposed as a very efficient alternative  due to their affordability, high throughput, and deep coverage, all of them  characteristics of high-quality next-generation sequencing data. The purpose of  this study is to describe the prevalence of clinically actionable  pharmacogenetic variants previously described in the scientific literature, as  well as that of new variants identified by next-generation sequencing  technologies, and to evaluate the drugs potentially affected by such variants.
