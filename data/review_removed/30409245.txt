Community pharmacists and their role in pharmacogenomics testing: an Australian perspective drawing on international evidence.
Patients obtaining a prescription from a pharmacy expect that the drug will be effective and have minimal side-effects. Unfortunately, drugs exhibit the desired effect in ~25-60% of people prescribed any medication. Adverse effects occur at a rate of 10% in patients taking a medication, and this rate increases during and after hospitalisation, with the transition of care back to the ambulatory setting posing a particular risk. Pharmacogenomics testing has been shown to optimise pharmacotherapy by increasing medication effectiveness and reducing drug-related toxicity, thus curtailing overall healthcare costs. Evidence from international studies have shown that community pharmacists would be able to offer this highly relevant professional service to their clients, given suitable training. This specific training complements pharmacists' existing skills and expertise by educating them in an emerging scientific area of pharmacogenomics. However, in an increasingly tight financial climate, the provision of pharmacogenomics testing by Australian community pharmacists will only be viable with an appropriate reimbursement through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, currently accessible by other allied health practitioners but not by pharmacists.
