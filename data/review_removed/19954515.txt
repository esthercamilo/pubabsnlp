Characterisation of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms in a Ghanaian population.
Genetic influences on drug efficacy and tolerability are now widely known. Pharmacogenetics has thus become an expanding field with great potential for improving drug efficacy and reducing toxicity. Many pharmacologically-relevant polymorphisms do show variability among different populations. Knowledge of allelic frequency distribution within specified populations can be useful in explaining therapeutic failures, identifying potential risk groups for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and optimising doses for therapeutic efficacy. We sought to determine the prevalence of clinically relevant Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 variants in Ghanaians. We compared the data with other ethnic groups and further investigated intra country differences within the Ghanaian population to determine its value to pharmacogenetics studies.
