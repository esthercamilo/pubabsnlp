The Utility of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Variants to Guide Pharmacological Treatment in Complex Unipolar Major Depression: A Pilot Longitudinal Study.
Major depression is a frequent condition which variably responds to treatment. In view of its high prevalence, the presence of treatment resistance in major depression significantly impacts on quality of life. Tailoring pharmacological treatment based on genetic polymorphisms is a current trend to personalizing pharmacological treatment in patients with major depressive disorders. Current guidelines for the use of genetic tests in major depression issued by the Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) are based on CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms which constitute the strongest evidence for pharmacogenomic guided treatment. There is evidence of increased clinical response to pharmacological treatment in major depression although largely in non-treatment resistant patients from Western countries. In this study, well characterised participants (N = 15) with complex, largely treatment resistant unipolar major depression were investigated, and clinical improvement was measured at baseline and at week-8 after the pharmacogenomics-guided treatment with the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MÅDRS). Results suggested a statistically significant improvement (p = 0.01) of 16% at endpoint in the whole group and a larger effect in case of changes in medication regime (28%, p = 0.004). This small but appreciable effect can be understood in the context of the level of treatment resistance in the group. To our knowledge, this is the first study from the Middle East demonstrating the feasibility of this approach in the treatment of complex major depressive disorders.
