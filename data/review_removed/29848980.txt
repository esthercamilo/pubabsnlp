Clinical Relevant Polymorphisms Affecting Clopidogrel Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics: Insights from the Puerto Rico Newborn Screening Program.
<i>Background:</i> Variations in several clopidogrel-pharmacogenes have been linked to clopidogrel response variability and clinical outcomes. We aimed to determine the frequency distribution of major polymorphisms on <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>PON1</i>, <i>ABCB1</i> and <i>P2RY12</i> pharmacogenes in Puerto Ricans. <i>Methods</i>: This was a cross-sectional, population-based study of 200 unrelated "Guthrie" cards specimens from newborns registered in the Puerto Rican newborn screening program (PRNSP) between 2004 and 2014. Taqman<sup>®</sup> SNP assay techniques were used for genotyping. <i>Results:</i> Minor allele frequencies (MAF) were 46% for <i>PON1</i> (rs662), 41% for <i>ABCB1</i> (rs1045642), 14% for <i>CYP2C19</i>*17, 13% for <i>CYP2C19</i>*2, 12% for <i>P2RY12</i>-H2 and 0.3% for <i>CYP2C19</i>*4. No carriers of the <i>CYP2C19</i>*3 variants were detected. All alleles and genotype proportions were found to be in Hardy⁻Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Overall, there were no significant differences between MAFs of these variants in Puerto Ricans and the general population (<i>n</i> = 453) of the 1000 Genome project, except when comparisons to each individual parental group were performed (i.e., Africans, Europeans and East-Asians; <i>p</i> < 0.05). As expected, the prevalence of these markers in Puerto Ricans most resembled those in the 181 subjects from reference populations of the Americas. <i>Conclusions:</i> These prevalence data provide a necessary groundwork for future clinical studies of clopidogrel pharmacogenetics in Caribbean Hispanics.
