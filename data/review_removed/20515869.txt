CYP2D6 polymorphisms as predictors of outcome in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen: expanded polymorphism coverage improves risk stratification.
This study aimed to validate matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)/Taqman copy number assay (CNA) CYP2D6 genotyping by AmpliChip CYP450 Test for the prediction of tamoxifen metabolizer phenotypes in breast cancer, and to investigate the influence of CYP2D6 variant coverage on genotype-phenotype relationships and tamoxifen outcome.
