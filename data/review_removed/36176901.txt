<i>FOXO3</i> mutation predicting gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity in NSCLC patients through regulation of autophagy.
Hepatotoxicity is a common side effect for patients treated with gefitinib, but the related pathogenesis is unclear and lacks effective predictor and management strategies. A multi-omics approach integrating pharmacometabolomics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics was employed in non-small cell lung cancer patients to identify the effective predictor for gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity and explore optional therapy substitution. Here, we found that patients with rs4946935 AA, located in Forkhead Box O3 (<i>FOXO3</i>) which is a well-known autophagic regulator, had a higher risk of hepatotoxicity than those with the GA or GG variant (OR = 18.020, 95%CI = 2.473 to 459.1784, <i>P</i> = 0.018) in a gefitinib-concentration dependent pattern. Furthermore, functional experiments identified that rs4946935_A impaired the expression of <i>FOXO3</i> by inhibiting the promotor activity, increasing the threshold of autophagy initiation and inhibiting the autophagic activity which contributed to gefitinib-induced liver injury. In contrast, erlotinib-induced liver injury was independent on the variant and expression levels of <i>FOXO3</i>. This study reveals that <i>FOXO3</i> mutation, leading to autophagic imbalance, plays important role in gefitinib-induced hepatotoxicity, especially for patients with high concentration of gefitinib. In conclusion, <i>FOXO3</i> mutation is an effective predictor and erlotinib might be an appropriately and well-tolerated treatment option for patients carrying rs4946935 AA.
