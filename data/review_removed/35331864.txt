Development of an optimized and generic cost-utility model for analyzing genome-guided treatment data.
Economic evaluation is an integral component of informed public health decision-making in personalized medicine. However, performing economic evaluation assessments often requires specialized knowledge, expertise, and significant resources. To this end, developing generic models can significantly assist towards providing the necessary evidence for the cost-effectiveness of genome-guided therapeutic interventions, compared to the traditional drug treatment modalities. Here, we report a generic cost-utility analysis model, developed in R, which encompasses essential economic evaluation steps. Specifically, critical steps towards a comprehensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were incorporated in our model, while also providing an easy-to-use graphical user interface, which allows even non-experts in the field to produce a fully comprehensive cost-utility analysis report. To further demonstrate the model's reproducibility, two sets of data were assessed, one stemming from in-house clinical data and one based on previously published data. By implementing the generic model presented herein, we show that the model produces results in complete concordance with the traditionally performed cost-utility analysis for both datasets. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of generic models to provide useful economic evidence for personalized medicine interventions.
