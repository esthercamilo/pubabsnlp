Alcohol intake potentiates clozapine adverse effects associated to CYP1A2*1C in patients with refractory psychosis.
Clozapine (CLZ) is an atypical antipsychotic and the gold standard for refractory psychosis treatment. However, there is little information regarding pharmacogenetics of CLZ in patients with refractory psychosis and its clinical correlation with alcohol intake. Although neurological effects of CLZ in patients with concomitant alcohol intake are documented, its use is very common in patients with psychosis. We explored the impact of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 genetic variants on CLZ pharmacokinetics and side effects, along with coffee/alcohol/tobacco consumption habits and clinical data of 48 adult patients with refractory psychosis on CLZ antipsychotic monotherapy. Relevant CYP variants in CLZ metabolism were evaluated by targeted genotyping and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. CLZ and its main metabolite plasma concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Biochemical and molecular data, along with other potential confounders, were included in the analysis by linear regression. Overall, CYP variants showed no effect on CLZ pharmacokinetics. The rs2069514 variant in homozygous genotype (also known as CYP1A2*1C/*1C) was associated with CLZ adverse reactions in Mexican patients with refractory psychosis (OR = 3.55 CI<sub>95</sub>  = 1.041-12.269, p = .043) and demonstrated that this effect is doubled by concomitant alcohol consumption (OR = 7.9 CI<sub>95</sub>  = 1.473-42.369, p = .016). Clinicians should be aware of this information before starting CLZ use, when treating patients with refractory psychosis, who are alcohol drinkers and carriers of this genetic variant in order to prevent CLZ-related adverse reactions. Nevertheless, our findings should be replicated in larger samples.
