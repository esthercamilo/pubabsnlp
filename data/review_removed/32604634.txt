Association Between Number of Actionable Pharmacogenetic Variants and Length of Hospital Stay.
The goal of this study was to evaluate association between number of pharmacogenetic variants and length of hospital stay. Electronic medical records were combined with exome sequencing results in 450 hospitalized patients. De-identified data set was used to characterize urgent care utilization and to identify presence of 44 actionable pharmacogenetic variants according to the guidelines of the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium. The average age was 58.03 ± 16.47 ranging from 20 to 91 years old, average number of pharmacogenetic variants was 61.22 ± 26.52 ranging from 20 to 169, and mean length of hospital stay was 6.50 ± 4.29 ranging between 1 and 42 days. After adjusting for patient socio-demographics and overall disease severity reflected by the Charlson comorbidity index, a significant association between mean length of stay and number of pharmacogenetic variants was found using generalized linear regression (p-value < 2.2e-16).
