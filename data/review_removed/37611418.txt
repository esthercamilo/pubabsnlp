A precision medicine approach to personalized prescribing using genetic and nongenetic factors for clinical decision-making.
Screening potential drug-drug interactions, drug-gene interactions, contraindications, and other factors is crucial in clinical practice. However, implementing these screening concepts in real-world settings poses challenges. This work proposes an approach towards precision medicine that combines genetic and nongenetic factors to facilitate clinical decision-making. The approach focuses on raising the performance of four potential interaction screenings in the prescribing process, including drug-drug interactions, drug-gene interactions, drug-herb interactions, drug-social lifestyle interactions, and two potential considerations for patients with liver or renal impairment. The work describes the design of a curated knowledge-based model called the knowledge model for potential interaction and consideration screening, the screening logic for both the detection module and inference module, and the personalized prescribing report. Three case studies have demonstrated the proof-of-concept and effectiveness of this approach. The proposed approach aims to reduce decision-making processes for healthcare professionals, reduce medication-related harm, and enhance treatment effectiveness. Additionally, the recommendation with a semantic network is suggested to assist in risk-benefit analysis when health professionals plan therapeutic interventions with new medicines that have insufficient evidence to establish explicit recommendations. This approach offers a promising solution to implementing precision medicine in clinical practice.
