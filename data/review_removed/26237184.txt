Genetic variants in 6-mercaptopurine pathway as potential factors of hematological toxicity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.
We investigated the associations between variants in genes coding for enzymes and transporters related to the 6-mercaptopurine pathway and clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
