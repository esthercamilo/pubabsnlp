Usefulness and difficulties with the thiopurine pharmacogenomic NUDT15 genotyping test: Analysis of real-world data in Japan.
The usefulness of NUDT15 genotyping as a pharmacogenomic test for thiopurine has been established. The first such test developed to date, NUDT15 genotyping was approved for reimbursement in Japan in February 2019 for all indicated patients. We retrospectively examined claims data in Japan and confirmed that the proportion of patients who undergo genotyping before initiating a new thiopurine regimen has increased; furthermore, genotyping has improved the rate of treatment continuation and reduced on-treatment hospitalization. However, the genotyping rate before thiopurine induction was >50% for patients with inflammatory bowel disease and <20% for those with other immune-related diseases, indicating significant variation by disease field. Additionally, over 10% of tests were found to have been performed inappropriately, such as multiple genotyping of the same patient or testing more than 2 weeks after starting treatment. Although NUDT15 genotyping for patients requiring thiopurine treatment has been shown to improve thiopurine treatment continuation rate, measures are required to address the systematic issues identified in our analysis.
