Sex differences in behavior and neuropharmacology of zebrafish.
Sex is an important variable in biomedical research. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly utilized as a powerful new model organism in translational neuroscience and pharmacology. Mounting evidence indicates important sex differences in zebrafish behavioral and neuropharmacological responses. Here, we discuss the role of sex in zebrafish central nervous system (CNS) models, their molecular mechanisms, recent findings and the existing challenges in this field. We also emphasize the growing utility of zebrafish models in translational neuropharmacological research of sex differences, fostering future CNS drug discovery and the search for novel sex-specific therapies. Finally, we highlight the interplay between sex and environment in zebrafish models of sex-environment correlations as an important strategy of CNS disease modeling using this aquatic organism.
