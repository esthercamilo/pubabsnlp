Contrasting <i>ABCB1</i> pharmacogenetics and psychotropic responses in child and adolescent psychiatry: a case comparison.
This case comparison illustrates pharmacogenetic testing in psychotropic and clinical management in relation to the <i>ABCB1</i> gene, which encodes the P-glycoprotein transporter affecting blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Two pediatric patients (9 and 11 years old) were selected for similar clinical presentations with opposing <i>ABCB1</i> genotype, while they were identically matched for key CYP450, dopaminergic and serotonergic genes (<i>CYP2C9</i>, <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>DRD2</i>, <i>SLC6A4</i>, <i>5HTR2A</i>). Case A was functional for the <i>ABCB1</i> gene (<i>G/G</i> rs1045642), suggesting that the BBB had a functional P-glycoprotein transporter. Case B was subfunctional for the <i>ABCB1</i> gene (<i>A/A</i> rs1045642), suggesting that the patient's BBB may be permeable to psychotropic drugs. Case A had more medication trials and dose adjustments than Case B. Case A had two inpatient admissions and interspersed emergency room visits, while case B had none.
