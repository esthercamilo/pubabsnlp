Current challenges and opportunities for pharmacogenomics: perspective of the Industry Pharmacogenomics Working Group (I-PWG).
Pharmaceutical companies have increasingly utilized genomic data for the selection of drug targets and the development of precision medicine approaches. Most major pharmaceutical companies routinely collect DNA from clinical trial participants and conduct pharmacogenomic (PGx) studies. However, the implementation of PGx studies during clinical development presents a number of challenges. These challenges include adapting to a constantly changing global regulatory environment, challenges in study design and clinical implementation, and the increasing concerns over patient privacy. Advances in the field of genomics are also providing new opportunities for pharmaceutical companies, including the availability of large genomic databases linked to patient health information, the growing use of polygenic risk scores, and the direct sequencing of clinical trial participants. The Industry Pharmacogenomics Working Group (I-PWG) is an association of pharmaceutical companies actively working in the field of pharmacogenomics. This I-PWG perspective will provide an overview of the steps pharmaceutical companies are taking to address each of these challenges, and the approaches being taken to capitalize on emerging scientific opportunities.
