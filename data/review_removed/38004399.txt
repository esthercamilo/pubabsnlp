Pharmacogenomic Analysis of Combined Therapies against Glioblastoma Based on Cell Markers from Single-Cell Sequencing.
Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive form of primary brain cancer and the lack of viable treatment options has created an urgency to develop novel treatments. Personalized or predictive medicine is still in its infancy stage at present. This research aimed to discover biomarkers to inform disease progression and to develop personalized prophylactic and therapeutic strategies by combining state-of-the-art technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing, systems pharmacology, and a polypharmacological approach. As predicted in the pyroptosis-related gene (PRG) transcription factor (TF) microRNA (miRNA) regulatory network, TP53 was the hub gene in the pyroptosis process in glioblastoma (GBM). A LASSO Cox regression model of pyroptosis-related genes was built to accurately and conveniently predict the one-, two-, and three-year overall survival rates of GBM patients. The top-scoring five natural compounds were parthenolide, rutin, baeomycesic acid, luteolin, and kaempferol, which have NFKB inhibition, antioxidant, lipoxygenase inhibition, glucosidase inhibition, and estrogen receptor agonism properties, respectively. In contrast, the analysis of the cell-type-specific differential expression-related targets of natural compounds showed that the top five subtype cells targeted by natural compounds were endothelial cells, microglia/macrophages, oligodendrocytes, dendritic cells, and neutrophil cells. The current approach-using the pharmacogenomic analysis of combined therapies-serves as a model for novel personalized therapeutic strategies for GBM treatment.
