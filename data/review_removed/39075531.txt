Postoperative radiotherapy with docetaxel versus cisplatin for high-risk oral squamous cell carcinoma: a randomized phase II trial with exploratory analysis of ITGB1 as a potential predictive biomarker.
Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) causes significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. Surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy remains the standard treatment for locally advanced resectable OSCC. Results from landmark trials have established postoperative concurrent cisplatin-radiotherapy (Cis-RT) as the standard treatment for OSCC patients with high-risk pathologic features. However, cisplatin-related toxicity limits usage in clinical practice. Given the need for effective but less toxic alternatives, we previously conducted a single-arm trial showing favorable safety profiles and promising efficacy of concurrent docetaxel-radiotherapy (Doc-RT).
