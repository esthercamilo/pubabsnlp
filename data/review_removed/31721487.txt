Impact of Pharmacogenomics on Clinical Outcomes for Patients Taking Medications With Gene-Drug Interactions in a Randomized Controlled Trial.
The objective of the Genomics Used to Improve DEpression Decisions (GUIDED) trial was to evaluate the utility of pharmacogenomic testing to improve outcomes among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had not responded to at least 1 prior medication trial. The objective of the present analysis was to assess outcomes for the subset of patients expected to benefit from combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing because they were taking medications with predicted gene-drug interactions.
