Integrative Approach to Reveal Cell Type Specificity and Gene Candidates for Psoriatic Arthritis Outside the MHC.
We recently conducted a large association analysis to compare the genetic profiles between patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and cutaneous-only psoriasis (PsC). Despite including over 7,000 genotyped patients, only the MHC achieved genome-wide significance. In this study, we hypothesized that appropriate epigenomic elements (H3K27ac marks for active enhancers) can guide us to reveal valuable information about the loci with suggestive evidence of association. Our aim is to investigate these loci and explore how they may lead to the development of PsA. We evaluated this potential by investigating the genes connected with these loci from the perspective of pharmacogenomics and gene expression. We illustrated that markers with suggestive evidence of association outside the MHC region are enriched in H3K27ac marks for osteoblast and chondrogenic differentiated cells; using pharmacogenomics resources, we showed that genes near these markers are targeted by existing drugs used to treat psoriatic arthritis. Significantly, six of the ten suggestive significant loci overlapping the regulatory elements encompass genes differentially expressed (FDR < 5%) in differentiated osteoblasts, including genes participating in the Wnt signaling such as <i>RUNX1</i>, <i>FUT8</i>, and <i>CTNNAL1</i>. Our approach shows that epigenomic information can be used as cost-effective approach to enhance the inferences for GWAS results, especially in situations when few genome-wide significant loci are available. Our results also point the way to more directed investigations comparing the genetics of PsA and PsC.
