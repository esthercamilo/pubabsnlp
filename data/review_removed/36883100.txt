Rs205764 and rs547311 in linc00513 may influence treatment responses in multiple sclerosis patients: A pharmacogenomics Egyptian study.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by a complex etiology that is reflected in the lack of consistently predictable treatment responses across patients of seemingly similar characteristics. Approaches to demystify the underlying predictors of aberrant treatment responses have made use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), with imminent progress made in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with MS risk, disease progression, and treatment response. Ultimately, such pharmacogenomic studies aim to utilize the approach of personalized medicine to maximize patient benefit and minimize rate of disease progression.
