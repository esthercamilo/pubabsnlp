Developmental pharmacogenetics: a general paradigm for application to neonatal pharmacology and toxicology.
Therapy in newborn infants presents unique challenges. The consequences of exposure of the fetus to medications and environmental contaminants in utero (following the mother's exposure to these) may present, in the newborn, as congenital malformations or adverse drug reactions or have unknown long-term consequences. Risk is not uniformly distributed across a population. Rather, pharmacogenomic principles assert that an individual's unique clinical, genomic, and environmental information can be used to accurately predict predisposition to risk. The challenge is to identify the specific factors--genetic and nongenetic--that contribute to increased risk.
