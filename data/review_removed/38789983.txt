Frequency of pharmacogenomic variants affecting efficacy and safety of anti-cancer drugs in a south Asian population from Sri Lanka.
Therapy with anti-cancer drugs remain the cornerstone of treating cancer. The effectiveness and safety of anti-cancer drugs vary significantly among individuals due to genetic factors influencing the drug response and metabolism. Data on the pharmacogenomic variations in Sri Lankans related to anti-cancer therapy is sparse. As current treatment guidelines in Sri Lanka often do not consider local pharmacogenomic variants, this study aimed to explore the diversity of pharmacogenomic variants in the Sri Lankan population to pave the way for personalized treatment approaches and improve patient outcomes.
