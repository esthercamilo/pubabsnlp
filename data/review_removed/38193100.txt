Outpatient Pharmacogenomic Screenings to Prevent Addiction, Overdose, and Suicide.
Point-of-care genetic testing for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to improve psychiatric treatment in outpatient settings remains a challenge. The presence or absence of certain genomic alleles determines the activity of the encoded enzymes, which ultimately defines the individual's drug metabolism rate. Classification of poor metabolizers (PMs) and rapid/ultrarapid metabolizers (RMs/UMs) would facilitate personalization and precision of treatment. However, current pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing of multiple genes is comprehensive and requires quantitative analyses for interpretations. We recommend qualitative, fast-track, point-of-care screenings, which are one- or-two gene-based analyses, as a quick initial screening tool to potentially eliminate the need for an expensive quantitative send-out test, which is a costly and lengthy process. We speculate that these tests will be relevant in two major scenarios: 1) clinical psychiatry for treating disease states such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where trial and error is still the mainstay of drug selection and symptom management, a process that is associated with significant delay in optimizing individualized treatment and dose, and thus response; and 2) pain management, where quickly determining an effective level of analgesia while avoiding a toxic level can cause a drastic improvement in mental health.
