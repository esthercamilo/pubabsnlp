Developmental pharmacogenetics of CYP2C19 in neonates and young infants: omeprazole as a probe drug.
Although substantial progress has been made in understanding of ontogeny of drug metabolism, there is still a gap of knowledge in developmental pharmacogenetics in neonates. We hypothesized that both age and pharmacogenetics might explain the developmental pattern of CYP2C19. We conducted a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenetic study to quantify the developmental pharmacogenetics of CYP2C19 in neonates and young infants using omeprazole as a probe drug.
