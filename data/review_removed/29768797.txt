Genetics, genomics and society: the responsibilities of scientists for science communication and education.
Misconceptions about genetics and genomics, such as notions of genetic determinism and the existence of 'genes for' particular traits, are widespread both in educational contexts and in the public perception of genetics and genomics. Owing to such misunderstandings, the prospect of personalized medicine often raises concerns with the general public about possible adverse societal consequences of the technologies that are implemented. Among the questions that are to be addressed in this context are: to what extent is personalized medical treatment possible? Does it require access to sensitive personal data? Who should be given such access? What other ethical issues might be raised by personalized medicine? How could these be answered? We argue that scientists have a professional responsibility to effectively communicate current knowledge and views about potential applications to the public in order to better address and resolve such issues.
