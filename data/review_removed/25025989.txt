Pharmacogenetics of quetiapine in healthy volunteers: association with pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and adverse effects.
Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic used for treatment of schizophrenia. Variability in response to this drug may be associated with pharmacogenetics. The aim of this study was to identify genetic markers related to the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and adverse effects of quetiapine. The study population comprised 79 healthy volunteers from two bioequivalence trials who were genotyped to identify polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes, receptors, and transporters. Quetiapine plasma levels were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Prolactin plasma levels were detected by indirect chemiluminescence. Possible adverse effects were recorded throughout the study. Factors with P value of 0.1 or less in the univariate analysis were included in a multiple regression analysis (logistic regression for adverse reactions). The area under the curve and clearance of quetiapine were affected by polymorphisms in CYP1A2 and DRD3, respectively. Men had a lower quetiapine area under the curve compared with women. Prolactin iC(max) was higher in volunteers harboring polymorphisms in CYP2C19 and AGT. An association was detected between polymorphisms in CYP1A1 and CYP2C9 and somnolence. Several polymorphisms are responsible for differences in the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of quetiapine in healthy individuals.
