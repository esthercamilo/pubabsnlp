Recent Patents for the Treatment of Asthma.
Despite adequate adherence and completion of anti-asthmatic treatment, many patients remain poorly controlled or uncontrolled. Asthma management is based on the use of medication to reverse the bronchial obstruction and eliminate the airway inflammation. New drug development is expected in the future as a consequence of discoveries in the pathophysiology and mechanisms of asthma. Currently, a good and effective set of treatments is available for these diseases. However, the search for new treatment modalities to improve the currently available is especially important for those patients unresponsive to current therapy.
