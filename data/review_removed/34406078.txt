Healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitudes and future expectations towards personalized medicine.
<b>Aim:</b> Personalized medicine (PM) is a novel approach to diagnose and treat disease. The study assessed the knowledge, attitudes and future expectations of healthcare professionals (HPs) towards PM in Ethiopia. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey with primary data and a simple random sampling technique was applied to collect data. <b>Results:</b> Our study revealed from a total of 384 respondents, 98 (25.5%), 146 (38%) and 140 (36.5%) had good, medium and poor knowledge of PM, respectively. However, 172 (44.8%), 185 (48.2%) and 27 (7%) had positive, neutral and negative attitudes towards PM, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> Most respondent's future expectations of PM were positive. Education level had a significant association with attitudes and other sociodemographic variables were not significant for both knowledge and attitude.
