Nuclear receptors PXR and CAR: implications for drug metabolism regulation, pharmacogenomics and beyond.
'Orphan' nuclear receptors belong to the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of transcriptional factors. Binding of ligands to these receptors results in the recruitment of the co-activators, thereby regulating the expression of cognate target genes.
