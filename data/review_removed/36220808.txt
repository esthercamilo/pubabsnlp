Barriers to genetic testing in clinical psychiatry and ways to overcome them: from clinicians' attitudes to sociocultural differences between patients across the globe.
Genetic testing has evolved rapidly over recent years and new developments have the potential to provide insights that could improve the ability to diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases. Information obtained through genetic testing has proven useful in other specialties, such as cardiology and oncology. Nonetheless, a range of barriers impedes techniques, such as whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing, pharmacogenomics, and polygenic risk scoring, from being implemented in psychiatric practice. These barriers may be procedural (e.g., limitations in extrapolating results to the individual level), economic (e.g., perceived relatively elevated costs precluding insurance coverage), or related to clinicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (e.g., perceived unfavorable cost-effectiveness, insufficient understanding of probability statistics, and concerns regarding genetic counseling). Additionally, several ethical concerns may arise (e.g., increased stigma and discrimination through exclusion from health insurance). Here, we provide an overview of potential barriers for the implementation of genetic testing in psychiatry, as well as an in-depth discussion of strategies to address these challenges.
