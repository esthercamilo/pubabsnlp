Update to the essential genomic nursing competencies and outcome indicators.
Genomic healthcare applications have relevance to all healthcare professionals including nursing, and most evidence-based clinical applications impact the quality and safety of healthcare. To guide nursing genomic competency initiatives, the Essential Nursing Competencies and Curricula Guidelines for Genetics and Genomics were established through a process of consensus in 2005. A 2009 update incorporated outcome indicators consisting of specific areas of knowledge and clinical performance indicators, to help support academic integration. Almost 20â€‰years have elapsed since these competencies were first established, yet incorporating the competencies into general and specialty scope and standards of nursing practice is inconsistent, competency integration into curricula is highly uneven, continuing education in genomics for nurses is limited, and the genomic capacity of the nursing workforce remains low. These deficits have persisted despite substantial advances in genomic technology which substantially reduced costs and increased evidence-based clinical applications, including direct to consumer genomic tests, the integration of genomics into evidence-based guidelines, and evidence that genomics impacts the quality and safety of healthcare.
