Evaluation of genetic association of neurodevelopment and neuroimmunological genes with antipsychotic treatment response in schizophrenia in Indian populations.
Neurodevelopmental and neuroimmunological genes critically regulate antipsychotic treatment outcome. We report genetic associations of antipsychotic response in 742 schizophrenia patients from Indian populations of Indo-European and Dravidian ancestry, segregated by disease severity. Meta-analysis comparing the two populations identified CCL2 [rs4795893: OR (95% CI) = 1.79 (1.27-2.52), P = 7.62 × 10(-4); rs4586: OR (95% CI) = 1.74 (1.24-2.43), P = 1.13 × 10(-3)] and GRIA4 [rs2513265: OR (95% CI) = 0.53 (0.36-0.78), P = 1.44 × 10(-3)] in low severity group; and, ADCY2 [rs1544938: OR (95% CI) = 0.36 (0.19-0.65), P = 7.68 × 10(-4)] and NRG1 [rs13250975, OR (95% CI) = 0.42 (0.23-0.79), P = 6.81 × 10(-3); rs17716295, OR (95% CI) = 1.78 (1.15-2.75), P = 8.71 × 10(-3)] in high severity group, with incomplete response toward antipsychotics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify genetic polymorphisms associated with the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia patients from two major India populations.
