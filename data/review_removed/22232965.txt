[ANKK1 gene in psychiatry].
According to last findings, one of the most commonly studied polymorphisms in psychiatry-Taq1A is located in the ANNK1 (Ankyrin Repeat and Kinase Domain containing 1) gene, not in the dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) gene. This polymorphism has been extensively studied in relation to alcohol, nicotine and drugs addiction, eating disorders, ADHD, schizophrenia and pharmacogenetics. The ANKK1 gene contains single serine/threonine kinase domain and 11 ankyrin repeats. ANKK1 belongs to RIP (Receptor-Interacting Protein) serine/threonine kinase family. These kinases are important in cell proliferation, differentiation and activate transcription factors. DRD2 gene is probably regulated by ANKK1 through NF-kappaB (Nuclear Factor-kappaB). ANKK1 is activated by apomorphine-dopaminergic agonist, which indicates another link with the dopaminergic system. It seems accurate to search for associations of polymorphisms in ANKK1 gene with dopaminergic system disorders.
