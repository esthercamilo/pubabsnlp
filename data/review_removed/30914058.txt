Encircling the regions of the pharmacogenomic landscape that determine drug response.
The integration of large-scale drug sensitivity screens and genome-wide experiments is changing the field of pharmacogenomics, revealing molecular determinants of drug response without the need for previous knowledge about drug action. In particular, transcriptional signatures of drug sensitivity may guide drug repositioning, prioritize drug combinations, and point to new therapeutic biomarkers. However, the inherent complexity of transcriptional signatures, with thousands of differentially expressed genes, makes them hard to interpret, thus giving poor mechanistic insights and hampering translation to clinics.
