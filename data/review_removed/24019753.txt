Association of CYP3A4/5, ABCB1 and ABCC2 polymorphisms and clinical outcomes of Thai breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.
Pharmacogenetic study of cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene CYP2D6 and tamoxifen outcomes remain controversial. Apart from CYP2D6, other drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters also play a role in tamoxifen metabolic pathways. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of CYP3A4/5, ABCB1, and ABCC2 polymorphisms on the risk of recurrence in Thai patients who received tamoxifen adjuvant therapy.
