Pharmacogenetics: A strategy for personalized medicine for autoimmune diseases.
For many years, a considerable number of patients with autoimmune diseases (ADs) have suffered from a lack of drug response and drug-related toxicity. Despite the emergence of new therapeutic options such as biological agents, patients continue to struggle with these problems. Unfortunately, new challenges, including the paradoxical effects of biological drugs, have complicated the situation. In recent decades, efforts have been made to predict drug response as well as drug-related side effects. Thanks to the many advances in genetics, evaluation of markers to predict drug response/toxicity before the initiation of treatment may be an avenue toward personalizing treatments. Implementing pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in the clinic could improve clinical care; however, obstacles remain to effective personalized medicine for ADs. The present study attempted to clarify the concept of pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics for ADs. After an overview on the pathogenesis of the most common types of treatments, this paper focuses on pharmacogenetic studies related to the selected ADs. Bridging the gap between pharmacogenetics and personalized medicine is also discussed. Moreover, the advantages, disadvantages and recommendations related to making personalized medicine practical for ADs have been addressed.
