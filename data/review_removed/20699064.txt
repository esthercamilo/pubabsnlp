[Level of evidence for therapeutic drug monitoring of cisplatin].
Cisplatin is an anticancer agent widely used in clinical practice. Cisplatin undergoes irreversible protein binding in plasma and presents a major nephrotoxicity. Some studies determined unbound and bound platin concentrations using flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry or chromatography. These studies showed a relationship between cisplatin exposition, notably its maximal concentration, and nephrotoxicity. However, the relationship between cisplatin exposition and its efficacy is not yet established. The population approach using a nonlinear mixed effects model showed a low variability of drug exposition parameters. In some cases, Bayesian adaptative dosing were proposed. However, some particular populations will have to be taken into account such as children, elderly patients, acute or chronic renal failure. The impact of cisplatin pharmacogenetics on its therapeutic monitoring need to be studied. Therapeutic cisplatin monitoring is today possibly useful measuring maximal concentration and using described adjusted-modelling. Some prospective multicentric validations are required.
