Relevance of pharmacogenomics for developing countries in Europe.
Pharmacogenomics holds promise of personalized treatment for patients suffering from many common diseases, particularly those with multiple treatment modalities. Owing to recent advances in the deciphering of the human genome sequence, high throughput genotyping technology has led to the reduction of the overall costs of genetic testing and allowed the inclusion of genotype-related dosing recommendations into drug package inserts, hence enabling the integration of pharmacogenomics into clinical practice. Although pharmacogenomics gradually assumes an important part in routine clinical practice in developed countries, many countries, particularly from the developing world, still do not have access either to the knowledge or the resources to individualize drug therapy. The PharmacoGenetics for Every Nation Initiative (PGENI) aims to fill this gap, by making pharmacogenomics globally applicable, not only by defining population-specific pharmacogenomic marker frequency profiles but also by formulating country-specific recommendations for drug efficacy and safety. This article aims to highlight the PGENI activities in Europe in an effort to make pharmacogenomics readily applicable in the European healthcare systems, particularly those in developing countries.
