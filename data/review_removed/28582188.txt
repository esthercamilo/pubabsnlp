Pharmacogenomics in Interventional Pharmacology: Present Status and Future Directions.
Pharmacogenomics offers the possibility of tailoring a drug to a patient's unique genetic signature, improving the likelihood of clinical efficacy while minimizing risks. Clopidogrel, a platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor that forms the cornerstone of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with unstable coronary artery disease and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, is the first broadly used drug in cardiovascular medicine in which genotyping may help optimize outcomes. This article describes techniques to identify the genetic determinants of drug response, their application (ie, clopidogrel), and the challenges to integration of pharmacogenomics into the practice of interventional cardiology.
