Identification and Enzymatic Activity Evaluation of a Novel <i>CYP2C9</i> Allelic Variant Discovered in a Patient.
Warfarin is a widely prescribed anticoagulant but the doses required to attain the optimum therapeutic effect exhibit dramatic inter-individual variability. Pharmacogenomics-guided warfarin dosing has been recommended to improve safety and effectiveness. We analyzed the cytochrome P450 2C9 (<i>CYP2C9</i>) and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (<i>VKORC1</i>) genes among 120 patients taking warfarin. A new coding variant was identified by sequencing <i>CYP2C9</i>. The novel A > G mutation at nucleotide position 14,277 led to an amino acid substitution of isoleucine with valine at position 213 (I213V). The functional consequence of the variant was subsequently evaluated <i>in vitro</i>. cDNA of the novel variant was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and the recombinant protein was expressed <i>in vitro</i> using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system. The recombinant protein expression was quantified at apoprotein and holoprotein levels. Its enzymatic activities toward tolbutamide, warfarin and losartan were then assessed. It exhibited changed <i>apparent Km</i> values and increases of 148%, 84% and 67% in the intrinsic clearance of tolbutamide, warfarin and losartan, respectively, compared to wild-type CYP2C9*1, indicating dramatically enhanced <i>in vitro</i> enzymatic activity. Our study suggests that the amino acid at position 213 in wild-type CYP2C9*1 may be important for the enzymatic activity of CYP2C9 toward tolbutamide, warfarin and losartan. In summary, a patient taking high-dose warfarin (6.0Â mg/day) in order to achieve the target international normalized ratio was found to have a mutation in the <i>CYP2C9</i> gene.
