The future of genomic testing in primary care: the changing face of personalized medicine.
Primary care is recognized worldwide as a key component for improving health outcomes in the population. At the same time, healthcare systems are rapidly changing with increasing expectations from technological advances. Genomics is a major driver in changing how medicine is being practiced; however, the importance for primary care has been under-appreciated. Strategically implementing genomics in a way that accounts for the unique characteristics of the primary care context is essential. In this perspective, we present important areas that we believe are critical in consideration of both the future of genomic medicine and primary healthcare delivery.
