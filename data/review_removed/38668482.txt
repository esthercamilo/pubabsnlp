Effect of CYP2D6, 2C19, and 3A4 Phenoconversion in Drug-Related Deaths.
Molecular autopsy is a very important tool in forensic toxicology. However, many determinants, such as co-medication and physiological parameters, should be considered for optimal results. These determinants could cause phenoconversion (PC), a discrepancy between the real metabolic profile after phenoconversion and the phenotype determined by the genotype. This study's objective was to assess the PC of drug-metabolizing enzymes, namely CYP2D6, 2C19, and 3A4, in 45 <i>post-mortem</i> cases where medications that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of these enzymes were detected. It also intended to evaluate how PC affected the drug's metabolic ratio (MR) in four cases. Blood samples from 45 cases of drug-related deaths were analyzed to detect and determine drug and metabolite concentrations. Moreover, all the samples underwent genotyping utilizing the HaloPlex Target Enrichment System for <i>CYP2D6</i>, <i>2C19</i>, and <i>3A4</i>. The results of the present study revealed a statistically significant rate of PC for the three investigated enzymes, with a higher frequency of poor metabolizers after PC. A compatibility was seen between the results of the genomic evaluation after PC and the observed MRs of venlafaxine, citalopram, and fentanyl. This leads us to focus on the determinants causing PC that may be mainly induced by drug interactions. This complex phenomenon can have a significant impact on the analysis, interpretation of genotypes, and accurate conclusions in forensic toxicology. Nevertheless, more research with more cases in the future is needed to confirm these results.
