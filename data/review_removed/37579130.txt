Examining Whether Genetic Variants Moderate the Skeletal Effects of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors in Older Adolescents and Young Adults.
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To examine whether serotonin (5-HT) related genetic variants moderate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) at the radius, lumbar spine (LS) BMD, total body less head (TBLH) bone mineral content (BMC) and markers of bone metabolism (osteocalcin, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX-1], and bone specific alkaline phosphatase to CTX-1 ratio) were examined in an observational study, enrolling 15- to 20-year-old participants, unmedicated or within a month of SSRI initiation. Variants in <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295), <i>HTR1B</i> (rs6296), <i>HTR1D</i> (rs6300), <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311 and rs6314), <i>HTR2B</i> (rs6736017), and the serotonin transporter intron 2 variable number tandem repeat (STin2 VNTR) were genotyped. Linear mixed-effects regression analysis examined associations between SSRI use, genetic variants, and skeletal outcomes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> After adjusting for relevant covariates, rs6295 CC and GC genotypes in 262 participants (60% female, mean ± SD age = 18.9 ± 1.6 years) were significantly associated with higher LS BMD compared to the GG genotype. Rs6311 GG SSRI users had greater LS BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.18, <i>p</i> = <0.0001). Female SSRI users with the combination of rs6295 CC+GC and rs6311 GG genotypes had greater LS BMD than female SSRI nonusers (<i>β</i> = 0.29, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). SSRI users with the rs6295 GG genotype had higher trabecular BMD compared to nonusers (<i>β</i> = 3.60, <i>p</i> = 0.05). No significant interactions were found for TBLH BMC or bone turnover markers. After correcting for multiple comparisons, none of the results retained significance. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> In older adolescents and young adults, <i>HTR1A</i> (rs6295) and <i>HTR2A</i> (rs6311) variants may moderate the effect of SSRIs on BMD. Sex differences may exist and require further examination. Further research with larger sample sizes is needed to confirm our preliminary findings. <b><i>Clinical Trial Registration:</i></b> clinicaltrials.gov NCT02147184.
