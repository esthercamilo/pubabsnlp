[Genetic polymorphisms and opioid therapies].
Interindividual variability in pain perception and response to opioids in terms of efficacy and side effects has been long noted. Numerous genes have been proposed as ideal candidate genes for the study of the genetic component of pain and pharmacogenetics of opioids. Despite the inherent complexity in studying pain, it is obvious that several genetic polymorphisms contribute to modulate nociception and the antinociceptive effects of opioids; specifically those involved in pharmacokinetics and the metabolism of opioids (cytochrome P450) and neurotransmitters (catechol-O-methyltransferase), as well as those affecting pharmacodynamics or the drug targets such as the mu-opioid receptor or the unexpected melanocortin 1-receptor.
