Two Novel Loci of <i>RELN</i> Associated With Antipsychotics Response in Chinese Han Population.
There are great individual differences in the drug responses; however, there are few prognostic drug response biomarkers available. <i>RELN</i> is one of the more extensively examined schizophrenia candidate genes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether <i>RELN</i> can affect antipsychotics response in the Chinese population. This may lead to the discovery of relevant novel drug response markers.
