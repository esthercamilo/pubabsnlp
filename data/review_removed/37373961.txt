Advancing Precision Medicine in South Tyrol, Italy: A Public Health Development Proposal for a Bilingual, Autonomous Province.
This paper presents a comprehensive development plan for advancing precision medicine in the autonomous province of South Tyrol, Italy, a region characterized by its bilingual population and unique healthcare challenges. This study highlights the need to address the shortage of healthcare professionals proficient in language for person-centered medicine, the lag in healthcare sector digitalization, and the absence of a local medical university, all within the context of an initiated pharmacogenomics program and a population-based precision medicine study known as the "Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol" (CHRIS) study. The key strategies for addressing these challenges and integrating CHRIS study findings into a broader precision medicine development plan are discussed, including workforce development and training, investment in digital infrastructure, enhanced data management and analytic capabilities, collaboration with external academic and research institutions, education and capacity building, securing funding and resources, and promoting a patient-centered approach. This study emphasizes the potential benefits of implementing such a comprehensive development plan, including improved early detection, personal ized treatment, and prevention of chronic diseases, ultimately leading to better healthcare outcomes and overall well-being in the South Tyrolean population.
