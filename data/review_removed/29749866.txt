How should whole-genome sequencing be implemented in children? A consideration of the current limitations.
In children, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is envisioned as a tool to improve diagnosis of undiagnosed diseases and to improve population-based screening. Pilot applications have shown benefits: genomic information has been used as a diagnostic aid; pharmacogenomics can reduce medicine-related adverse events; advanced knowledge of the potential for later-onset disease can target tests and appropriate therapies. However, emerging technical, conceptual and ethical challenges may limit WGS from fulfilling the current vision for future applications. WGS platforms still struggle with reliability and accuracy. The role of the genome in long-term organismal function and disease is still being established. Ethical implications of WGS in both undiagnosed disease and population screening, particularly potential impacts of testing on children and their families are still unresolved.
