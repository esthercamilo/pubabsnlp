Pharmacogenetic testing in primary care practice: opinions of physicians, pharmacists and patients.
<b>Aim:</b> Although health authorities have set pharmacogenetic (PGx) markers on labels of hundreds of drugs, the use of PGx in clinical care remains infrequent. The adoption of PGx will depend on the opinions of physicians, pharmacists and patients. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Qualitative focus group interviews were performed with 23 physicians, 11 pharmacists and 30 patients. <b>Results:</b> Majority of the participants showed enthusiasm toward the implementation of PGx in clinics. Lack of knowledge on PGx, roles of healthcare providers, factors in favor and challenges of PGx implementation, ethical and insurance issues, educational and tools needs were the key themes that emerged from the interviews. <b>Conclusion:</b> Several barriers impede the uptake of PGx in clinics, however, opinions of physicians, pharmacists and patients are mostly favorable.
