Lack of tacrolimus circadian pharmacokinetics and CYP3A5 pharmacogenetics in the early and maintenance stages in Japanese renal transplant recipients.
We investigated whether tacrolimus pharmacokinetics shows circadian variation and the influence of the CYP3A5 A6986G polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics in both the early and maintenance stages after renal transplantation.
