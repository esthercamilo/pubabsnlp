Prediction of LDL cholesterol response to statin using transcriptomic and genetic variation.
Statins are widely prescribed for lowering LDL-cholesterol (LDLC) levels and risk of cardiovascular disease. There is, however, substantial inter-individual variation in the magnitude of statin-induced LDLC reduction. To date, analysis of individual DNA sequence variants has explained only a small proportion of this variability. The present study was aimed at assessing whether transcriptomic analyses could be used to identify additional genetic contributions to inter-individual differences in statin efficacy.
