Management of side effects in the personalized medicine era: chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.
Pharmacogenomics has been establishing itself as a powerful tool to predict individual response to treatment, in order to personalize therapy management; this field has been explored in particular in Oncology. Not only efficacy on the malignant disease has been investigated, but also the possibility to predict adverse effects due to drug administration. Chemotherapy-Induced Neurotoxicity (CIPN) is one of those. This potentially severe and long-lasting/permanent side effect of commonly administered anticancer drugs can severely impair Quality of Life (QoL) in a large cohort of long survival patients. So far, a pharmacogenomics-based approach in CIPN regard has been quite delusive, making a methodological improvement warranted in this field of interest: even the most refined genetic analysis cannot be effective if not applied correctly. Here, we try to devise why it is so, suggesting how THE "bench-side" (Pharmacogenomics) might benefit from and should cooperate with THE "bed-side" (Clinimetrics), in order to make genetic profiling effective if applied to CIPN.
