The effect of <i>CYP2C19</i> genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy on outcomes of selective percutaneous coronary intervention patients: an observational study.
<b>Aim:</b> To observe if personalized antiplatelet therapy according to the <i>CYP2C19</i> phenotype can improve the outcomes of patients receiving selective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). <b>Methods:</b> In this observational study, 677 Chinese patients undergoing selective PCI were divided into gene group (n = 369) and conventional group (n = 308), and given antiplatelet therapy according to the <i>CYP2C19</i> genotype or clinical features, respectively. Incidence of MACE (death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and unplanned repeat revascularization) and bleeding was compared between the two groups after 18 months. <b>Results:</b> Diabetes, heart dysfunction and SYNTAX score (>15), but not routinely <i>CYP2C19</i> genotype test-guided antiplatelet therapy, were associated with MACE. The incidence of bleeding showed no difference. <b>Conclusion:</b><i>CYP2C19</i> phenotype-guided antiplatelet therapy may have no influence on the outcomes of selective PCI patients. Clinical features-guided antiplatelet therapy may be reasonable.
