Differential connectivity of gene regulatory networks distinguishes corticosteroid response in asthma.
Variations in drug response between individuals have prevented us from achieving high drug efficacy in treating many complex diseases, including asthma. Genetics plays an important role in accounting for such interindividual variations in drug response. However, systematic approaches for addressing how genetic factors and their regulators determine variations in drug response in asthma treatment are lacking.
