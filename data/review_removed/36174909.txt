Sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is not affected by OPRM1 A118G and BDNF Va66Met polymorphisms, but alters the plasma beta-endorphin and BDNF levels in individuals with opioid use disorder.
The study aimed to examine the genetic contribution to buprenorphine (BUP) treatment in individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), with a specific focus on BDNF and OPRM1 genes. A total of 113 controls and 111 OUD patients receiving sublingual BUP/naloxone were enrolled. OPRM1 A118G and BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms were investigated by PCR-FRLP. Plasma BDNF and beta-endorphin levels were assessed by ELISA kits in both groups. Blood BUP levels were measured by LC-MS/MS and normalized with daily BUP dose (BUP/D). OPRM1 A118G and BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms didn't have an effect on plasma beta-endorphin and BDNF levels in OUD patients, respectively. Interestingly, OUD patients had significantly higher plasma BDNF and lower beta-endorphin levels compared to the controls (p < 0.001). A negative and significant correlation between plasma BUP/D and BDNF levels was found. Age onset of first use was associated with OPRM1 A118G polymorphism. The findings indicated that sublingual BUP/naloxone may increase plasma BDNF levels, but may decrease beta-endorphin levels in individuals with OUD. Plasma BDNF level seemed to be decreased in a BUP/D concentration-dependent manner.
