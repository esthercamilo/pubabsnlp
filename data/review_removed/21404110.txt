Population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of vincristine in paediatric patients treated for solid tumour diseases.
The interindividual variability of vincristine pharmacokinetics is quite large, but the origins of this variability are not properly understood. The aim of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model of vincristine in a paediatric population treated for solid tumour disease and evaluate the impact of different ABCB1, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 polymorphisms on the different pharmacokinetic parameters.
