A pharmacogenetics-based approach to reduce cardiovascular mortality with the prophylactic use of statins.
Nitric oxide (NO) is the main endothelial-derived relaxation factor and plays a major role in cardiovascular homeostasis. This key signalling molecule is synthesised by a family of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), and the endothelial isoform (eNOS) is the most important for nitric oxide formation in the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular drugs including statins increase eNOS expression and up-regulate NO formation, and this effect may be responsible for protective, pleiotropic effects produced by statins. However, the genetic background may also affect NO formation in the cardiovascular system, and recent studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms in the eNOS gene modify endogenous NO formation and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. For example, cases with the CC genotype for the T(-786)C polymorphism in the eNOS gene are at increased cardiovascular risk when compared with those with the TT genotype. Interestingly, pharmacogenetic studies have recently indicated that atorvastatin improves NO formation more clearly in these individuals. However, it is not known whether this polymorphism really increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and whether atorvastatin or other statins attenuate the morbidity and mortality rates in cases with the CC genotype. If proved true, then statins-induced up-regulation of eNOS and increased NO formation could compensate for a genetic 'disadvantage' in cases with the CC genotype. This could be a significant advance in the prevention of cardiovascular events. It is necessary although to validate this hypothesis with clinical trials which will require a long follow-up to assess relevant clinical events and not only surrogate biomarkers.
