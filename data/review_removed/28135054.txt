Integrated analysis of genetic variation and gene expression reveals novel variant for increased warfarin dose requirement in African Americans.
Essentials Genetic variants controlling gene regulation have not been explored in pharmacogenomics. We tested liver expression quantitative trait loci for association with warfarin dose response. A novel predictor for increased warfarin dose response in African Americans was identified. Precision medicine must take into account population-specific variation in gene regulation.
