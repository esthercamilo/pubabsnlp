PD-L1-Mediated Immunosuppression in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Relationship with Macrophages Infiltration and Inflammatory Response Activity.
Immune dysfunction and pro-oncogenic inflammation play critical roles in malignant progression and non-response to immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In particular, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy could induce durable tumor remissions and improve the prognosis of patients to a certain extent. However, PD-L1, as a promising biomarker, has limited knowledge about its relevance to tumor microenvironment (TME) characterization and endogenous inflammatory immune responses. In this study, we systematically investigated and characterized the important intercommunication of PD-L1 with immunosuppressive TME and inflammatory response activity in HCC and predicted promising therapeutic drugs to improve the current therapeutic strategy for specific patients. We identified aberrant expression patterns of PD-L1 in HCC and completely different clinical and molecular characteristics among the PD-L1 subgroups. PD-L1 positively associated with immunosuppressive macrophages and macrophage-derived cytokines, which may contribute to the polarization of macrophages. Moreover, inflammatory response activity exhibited significant differences between high and low PD-L1 expression groups and had robust positive correlativity of the infiltration level of tumor-associated macrophages. Notably, given the immunosuppressive and inflammatory microenvironment in HCC, we screened four candidate drugs, including dasatinib, vemurafenib, topotecan and AZD6482, and corroborated in two pharmacogenomics databases, which might have potential therapeutic implications in specific HCC patients. Our results enhanced the understanding of linkage in PD-L1 expression patterns with macrophages and inflammation, which may provide new insight into the pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategy for HCC.
