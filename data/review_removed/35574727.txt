Population features of alleles and genotypes frequency distribution of polymorphic genetic markers of antipsychotic medications pharmacokinetics in the Kazakh population.
The presented article is relevant, as the main goals of schizophrenia treatment are to achieve a response to psychopharmacotherapy, reduction and stabilization of psychopathological symptoms, qualitative remission, which in general implies the creation of a stable quality of life for the patient. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the population features of the frequency distribution of alleles and genotypes of polymorphic genetic variants of according to genome-wide association studies analysis of pharmacokinetics-associated antipsychotic medications, in an ethnically homogeneous Kazakh population. The research material was deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from the peripheral blood of 1,800 conditionally healthy persons of Kazakh nationality. DNA isolation was carried out by the magnetic polyvinyl alcohol magnetic particle separation method. The analysis of the frequency distribution of the studied genotypes in the Kazakh population showed their compliance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for all studied polymorphisms (p > .05). The obtained results showed that CYP2C19 (rs4244285, rs4986893) polymorphisms occurs in Kazakhs significantly more often than European and a number of Asian populations, which significantly affects the decrease in effectiveness and increases the risk of side complications during therapy with antipsychotic medications in the Kazakh population.
