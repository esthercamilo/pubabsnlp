Investigating the Use of Pharmacogenetic and Pharmacometabolomic Markers to Predict Haloperidol Efficacy and Safety Rates.
<b>Background:</b> Haloperidol is commonly prescribed to patients with alcohol-induced psychotic disorder (AIPD). Notably however, individuals differ extensively with regards to therapeutic response and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Previous studies have shown that haloperidol biotransformation is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6. <b>Objective:</b> The objective of our study was to investigate the use of pharmacogenetic (CYP2D6*4 genetic polymorphism) and pharmacometabolomic biomarkers to predict haloperidol efficacy and safety rates. <b>Material and Methods:</b> The study enrolled 150 patients with AIPD. Therapy included haloperidol in a daily dose of 5 to 10 mg/day by injections for 5 days. Efficacy and safety of treatment were evaluated using the validated psychometric scales PANSS, UKU, and SAS. <b>Results:</b> No association of the urinary 6-НО-ТНВС/pinoline ratio values which could be evidence of the CYP2D6 activity level with both the efficacy and safety rates of haloperidol was demonstrated. However, a statistically significant association between haloperidol safety profile and CYP2D6*4 genetic polymorphism was demonstrated (<i>P</i> < .001). <b>Conclusion:</b> To predict haloperidol efficacy and safety rates, utilization of pharmacogenetic testing that defines CYP2D6*4 genetic polymorphism is found preferable over the use of the pharmacometabolomic marker in a clinical setting.
