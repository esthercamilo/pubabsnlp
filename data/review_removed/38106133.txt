Implementing a Pharmacogenomic-driven Algorithm to Guide Antiplatelet Therapy among Caribbean Hispanics: A non-randomized prospective cohort study.
After percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), clopidogrel resistant patients are at an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). We aimed to assess whether genotype-guided selection of oral antiplatelet drugs using a clinical decision support (CDS) algorithm reduces the occurrence of these ischemic events and improves outcomes among Caribbean Hispanic patients from Puerto Rico, who are underrepresented in clinical pharmacogenomic (PGx)-guided implementation studies.
