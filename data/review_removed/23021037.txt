Role of genomics on the path to personalized medicine.
Technology continues to lead the field of personalized medicine as the interpretation of the human genome is progressing. The cost and duration of genomic sequencing continue to decrease sharply and there is intensive research aimed at understanding how the changes that occur within the genome can alter its function and the genomic variations that constitute individual susceptibility to diseases and responses to therapy. The overlay of a personal genome with the personal medical record of patients has a potential to improve prediction and prevention and to allow a more pro-active therapeutic strategy. It is evident that pharmacogenomics and individualized drug therapy are the building blocks of personalized medicine. A growing number of drugs are now used for the treatment of cancer in subjects selected by a companion genetic test. Personalized medicine while based upon genomic knowledge of the individual requires equally essential personalised environmental information as well as the understanding of every subject's capacity for health-promoting behaviour.
