Immune-Related Gene Polymorphisms and Pharmacogenetic Studies in Nephrology.
A large subgroup of patients with chronic kidney disease still encounter serious adverse effects and lack of responsiveness to medications, possibly because of the interindividual genetic variability in genes involved in the metabolism and transport of the treatments used. As a consequence, several pharmacogenetic studies have been conducted in nephrology patients that examine the effect of genetic variants in response to treatment in kidney diseases. The present commentary focuses on immune-related genes (TNF [tumor necrosis factor], MIF [macrophage migration inhibitory factor], and IL-10 [interleukin 10]) or those genes that may regulate the response to immunosuppressive medications (ABCB1 [ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1] and ITPA [inosine triphosphatase]) used in kidney diseases. These genes were selected from those showing significant results in a recent meta-analysis of pharmacogenetic studies of patients with chronic kidney disease. This commentary highlights that certain polymorphisms should be investigated in patients with kidney diseases, especially if they are to be administered immunosuppressive agents. In certain cases, flavonoids such as quercetin may be beneficial.
