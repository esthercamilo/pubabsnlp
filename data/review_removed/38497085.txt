Clinical pharmacists' knowledge, attitude, perception, and beliefs about the role of pharmacogenetic testing for genes polymorphisms when prescribing mercaptopurine.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding proteins involved in mercaptopurine metabolism can influence drug efficacy and safety. This study aims to assess clinical pharmacists' knowledge about mercaptopurine-related genes and their polymorphisms and investigate their attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs about the need for and importance of pharmacogenetic testing for mercaptopurine.
