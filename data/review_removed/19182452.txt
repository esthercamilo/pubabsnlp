[Pharmacogenomics: inter-ethnic and intra-ethnic differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of clinically relevant drugs].
Intra- and inter-ethnic differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of clinically relevant drugs are important issues not only for scenes of appropriate drug use in clinical settings but also for those of the drug development. Pharmacogenomics is extremely useful for understanding these racial differences. In this presentation, I will introduce pharmacogenomic concepts (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotype) for interpretation of racial differences in some drugs; pharmacogenomics of drug transporters such as OATP1B1 (organic anion transporting-polypeptide 1B1) and OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1) in pravastatin, metformin, and rosuvastatin will be discussed as model drugs.
