Pharmacist-Led Medication Evaluation Considering Pharmacogenomics and Drug-Induced Phenoconversion in the Treatment of Multiple Comorbidities: A Case Report.
Pharmacogenomic (PGx) information can guide drug and dose selection, optimize therapy outcomes, and/or decrease the risk of adverse drug events (ADEs). This report demonstrates the impact of a pharmacist-led medication evaluation, with PGx assisted by a clinical decision support system (CDSS), of a patient with multiple comorbidities. Following several sub-optimal pharmacotherapy attempts, PGx testing was recommended. The results were integrated into the CDSS, which supported the identification of clinically significant drug-drug, drug-gene, and drug-drug-gene interactions that led to the phenoconversion of cytochrome P450. The pharmacist evaluated PGx results, concomitant medications, and patient-specific factors to address medication-related problems. The results identified the patient as a CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer (IM). Duloxetine-mediated competitive inhibition of CYP2D6 resulted in phenoconversion, whereby the patient's CYP2D6 phenotype was converted from IM to poor metabolizer for CYP2D6 co-medication. The medication risk score suggested a high risk of ADEs. Recommendations that accounted for PGx and drug-induced phenoconversion were accepted. After 1.5 months, therapy changes led to improved pain control, depression status, and quality of life, as well as increased heart rate, evidenced by patient-reported improved sleep patterns, movement, and cognition. This case highlights the pharmacist's role in using PGx testing and a CDSS to identify and mitigate medication-related problems to optimize medication regimen and medication safety.
