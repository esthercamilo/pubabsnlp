Feasibility of Community Pharmacist-Initiated and Point-of-Care <i>CYP2C19</i> Genotype-Guided De-Escalation of Oral P2Y12 Inhibitors.
Tailoring antiplatelet therapy based on <i>CYP2C19</i> pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing can improve cardiovascular outcomes and potentially reduce healthcare costs in patients on a P2Y<sub>12</sub>-inhibitor regime with prasugrel or ticagrelor. However, ubiquitous adoption-particularly in an outpatient setting-remains limited. We conducted a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the feasibility of <i>CYP2C19</i>-guided de-escalation of prasugrel/ticagrelor to clopidogrel through point-of-care (POC) PGx testing in the community pharmacy. Multiple feasibility outcomes were assessed. Overall, 144 patients underwent <i>CYP2C19</i> PGx testing in 27 community pharmacies. Successful test results were obtained in 142 patients (98.6%). De-escalation to clopidogrel occurred in 19 patients (20%) out of 95 (67%) eligible for therapy de-escalation, which was mainly due to PGx testing not being included in cardiology guidelines. Out of the 119 patients (84%) and 14 pharmacists (100%) surveyed, 109 patients (92%) found the community pharmacy a suitable location for PGx testing, and the majority of pharmacists (86%) thought it has added value. Net costs due to PGx testing were estimated at â‚¬43 per patient, which could be reduced by earlier testing and could turn into savings if de-escalation would double to 40%. Although the observed de-escalation rate was low, POC <i>CYP2C19</i>-guided de-escalation to clopidogrel appears feasible in a community pharmacy setting.
