Associations between <i>CES1</i> variants and dosing and adverse effects in children taking methylphenidate.
Methylphenidate is the most prescribed stimulant to treat attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Despite its widespread usage, a fair proportion of children are classified as non-responders to the medication. Variability in response and occurrence of adverse events with methylphenidate use may be due to several factors, including drug-drug interactions as well as pharmacogenetic differences resulting in pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic variances within the general population. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of carboxylesterase 1 (<i>CES1</i>) variants on the frequency of adverse effects and dosing requirements of methylphenidate in children with ADHD.
