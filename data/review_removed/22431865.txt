A randomized and clinical effectiveness trial comparing two pharmacogenetic algorithms and standard care for individualizing warfarin dosing (CoumaGen-II).
Warfarin is characterized by marked variations in individual dose requirements and a narrow therapeutic window. Pharmacogenetics (PG) could improve dosing efficiency and safety, but clinical trials evidence is meager.
