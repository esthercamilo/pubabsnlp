Pharmacogenetics Based Dose Prediction Model for Initial Tacrolimus Dosing in Renal Transplant Recipients.
Tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant used in solid organ transplantation, has a narrow therapeutic index and exhibits inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability. Achieving and maintaining a therapeutic level of the drug by giving appropriate doses is crucial for successful immunosuppression, especially during the initial post-transplant period. We studied the effect of <i>CYP3A5</i>, <i>CYP3A4</i>, and <i>ABCB1</i> gene polymorphisms on tacrolimus trough concentrations in South Indian renal transplant recipients from Kerala to formulate a genotype-based dosing equation to calculate the required starting daily dose of tacrolimus to be given to each patient to attain optimal initial post-transplant period drug level. We also investigated the effect of these genes on drug-induced adverse effects and rejection episodes and looked into the global distribution of allele frequencies of these polymorphisms. One hundred forty-five renal transplant recipients on a triple immunosuppressive regimen of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid were included in this study. Clinical data including tacrolimus daily doses, trough levels (C<sub>0</sub>) and dose-adjusted tacrolimus trough concentration (C<sub>0</sub>/D) in blood at three time points (day 6, 6Â months, and 1-year post-transplantation), adverse drug effects, rejection episodes, serum creatinine levels, etc., were recorded. The patients were genotyped for <i>CYP3A5</i>*3, <i>CYP3A4</i>*1B, <i>CYP3A4</i>*1G, <i>ABCB1</i> G2677T, and <i>ABCB1</i> C3435T polymorphisms by the PCR-RFLP method. We found that <i>CYP3A5</i>*3 polymorphism was the single most strongly associated factor determining the tacrolimus C<sub>0</sub>/D in blood at all three time points (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Using multiple linear regression, we formulated a simple and easy to compute equation that will help the clinician calculate the starting tacrolimus dose per kg body weight to be administered to a patient to attain optimal initial post-transplant period tacrolimus level. <i>CYP3A5</i> expressors had an increased chance of rejection than non-expressors (<i>p</i> = 0.028), while non-expressors had an increased risk for new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT) than expressors (<i>p</i> = 0.018). Genotype-guided initial tacrolimus dosing would help transplant recipients achieve optimal initial post-transplant period tacrolimus levels and thus prevent the adverse effects due to overdose and rejection due to inadequate dose. We observed inter-population differences in allele frequencies of drug metabolizer and transporter genes, emphasizing the importance of formulating population-specific dose prediction models to draw results of clinical relevance.
