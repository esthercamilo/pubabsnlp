Cardiovascular Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Pharmacogenomics for the Clinical Practitioner.
Current clinical cardiovascular practice requires a clinician to have a strong foundation in multiple aspects of pharmacology. Modern cardiovascular regimens are complex, and optimal management, application of evolving guidelines, and adoption of new therapies build off a more basic understanding of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In addition, it is likely time to add a third pillar into this discussion, the expanding field of pharmacogenomics referring to the genetic influences on drug response. This field has increasing applications in medicine and clearly holds significant promise for cardiovascular disease management. Awareness of pharmacogenomic advances and the fundamentals of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can help the clinician more easily deliver great care. Here we attempt to briefly summarize and simplify key concepts of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenomics relevant to the cardiovascular disease practitioner.
