Phenotype prediction and characterization of 25 pharmacogenes in Thais from whole genome sequencing for clinical implementation.
Publicly available pharmacogenomics (PGx) databases enable translation of genotype data into clinically actionable information. As variation within pharmacogenes is population-specific, this study investigated the spectrum of 25 clinically relevant pharmacogenes in the Thai population (n = 291) from whole genome sequencing. The bioinformatics tool Stargazer was used for phenotype prediction, through assignment of alleles and detection of structural variation. Known and unreported potentially deleterious PGx variants were identified. Over 25% of Thais carried a high-risk diplotype in CYP3A5, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, NAT2, SLCO1B1, and UGT1A1. CYP2D6 structural variants accounted for 83.8% of all high-risk diplotypes. Of 39 known PGx variants identified, six variants associated with adverse drug reactions were common. Allele frequencies of CYP3A5*3 (rs776746), CYP2B6*6 (rs2279343), and NAT2 (rs1041983) were significantly higher in Thais than East-Asian and global populations. 121 unreported variants had potential to exert clinical impact, majority were rare and population-specific, with 60.3% of variants absent from gnomAD database. This study demonstrates the population-specific variation in clinically relevant pharmacogenes, the importance of CYP2D6 structural variation detection in the Thai population, and potential of unreported variants in explaining drug response. These findings are essential in development of dosing guidelines, PGx testing, clinical trials, and drugs.
