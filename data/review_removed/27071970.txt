RP1-13D10.2 Is a Novel Modulator of Statin-Induced Changes in Cholesterol.
Numerous genetic contributors to cardiovascular disease risk have been identified through genome-wide association studies; however, identifying the molecular mechanism underlying these associations is not straightforward. The Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial of rosuvastatin users identified a sub-genome-wide association of rs6924995, a single-nucleotide polymorphism â‰ˆ10 kb downstream of myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein (MYLIP, aka IDOL and inducible degrader of low-density lipoprotein receptor [LDLR]), with LDL cholesterol statin response. Interestingly, although this signal was initially attributed to MYLIP, rs6924995 lies within RP1-13D10.2, an uncharacterized long noncoding RNA.
