Pharmacogenomic landscape of VIP genetic variants in Jordanian Arabs and comparison with worldwide populations.
The pharmacogenomics has lately become a focal field of research that investigates the influence of genetic variations of drug-metabolizing enzymes and their receptors and downstream proteins on the interindividual variability in response to medications and adverse drug reactions. Therefore, it is significantly important to study and analyze the variations in drug response between different ethnic groups and populations. The current study aimed to detect the distribution of the genotype and allele frequencies in several very important pharmacogenetic (VIP) gene polymorphisms in the Jordanian population of Arab descent. This study involved 500 unrelated Jordanian individuals of Arab descent. A total of 65 VIP variants located within 33 candidate genes were randomly selected from the PharmGKB database and genotyped using the MassARRAY (iPLEX GOLD) system. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the significant differences of minor allele and genotype frequencies between the Jordanian and other populations including CHE, ASW, CEU, CHB, CDX, GIH, GBR, JPT, LWK, MXL, TSI, YRI, CAR, and ACB. This study revealed six variants were not in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (P-value > 0.05) and ten SNPs showed monomorphic features. Most of the remaining forty-nine variant frequencies were significantly different from the compared ethnic groups (P-value < 0.05). The results of this study may be helpful to develop safer treatment by applying the concept of personalized medicine based on the profile of VIP pharmacogene variants of the Jordanian population of Arab descent.
