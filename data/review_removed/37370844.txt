Dose Optimization in Oncology Drug Development: The Emerging Role of Pharmacogenomics, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics.
Drugs' safety and effectiveness are evaluated in randomized, dose-ranging trials in most therapeutic areas. However, this is only sometimes feasible in oncology, and dose-ranging studies are mainly limited to Phase 1 clinical trials. Moreover, although new treatment modalities (e.g., small molecule targeted therapies, biologics, and antibody-drug conjugates) present different characteristics compared to cytotoxic agents (e.g., target saturation limits, wider therapeutic index, fewer off-target side effects), in most cases, the design of Phase 1 studies and the dose selection is still based on the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) approach used for the development of cytotoxic agents. Therefore, the dose was not optimized in some cases and was modified post-marketing (e.g., ceritinib, dasatinib, niraparib, ponatinib, cabazitaxel, and gemtuzumab-ozogamicin). The FDA recognized the drawbacks of this approach and, in 2021, launched Project Optimus, which provides the framework and guidance for dose optimization during the clinical development stages of anticancer agents. Since dose optimization is crucial in clinical development, especially of targeted therapies, it is necessary to identify the role of pharmacological tools such as pharmacogenomics, therapeutic drug monitoring, and pharmacodynamics, which could be integrated into all phases of drug development and support dose optimization, as well as the chances of positive clinical outcomes.
