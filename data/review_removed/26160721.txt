Correlation analysis of gene polymorphisms and β-lactam allergy.
A total of 64 patients with β-lactam allergy and 30 control subjects were enrolled in a case-control study. This study is aimed to analyze the relationship between β-lactam allergy and 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-13, IL-4Rα, high-affinity immunoglobulin E-receptor β chain (FcεRIβ), interferon γ receptor 2 (IFNGR2), and CYP3A4, and within the Han Chinese population of Northwest China. Genotyping for the SNPs was conducted using the Sequenom MassARRAY(®) platform. SPSS 17.0 was employed to analyze the statistical data and SHEsis was used to perform the haplotype reconstruction and analyze linkage disequilibrium of SNPs of IL-10 and IL-13. The results showed that the genotype distribution of CYP3A4 rs2242480/CT differed significantly between case and control groups of males (P=0.022; odds ratio (OR)=0.167, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.032-0.867). Further analysis showed that CCA, CCG, and TAA haplotypes of IL-10 had no significant correlation in patients with β-lactam allergy. The correlation between CCT and CAC haplotypes of IL-13 and β-lactam allergy needs to be further studied. The analysis did not reveal any differences in the distribution of others gene polymorphisms between cases and controls.
