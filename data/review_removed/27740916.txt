Can pharmacogenetics help patients under chronic treatment with coumarin anticoagulants?
Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective antithrombotic drugs. However, appropriate dosing is difficult to establish owing to its narrow therapeutic window as well as widespread inter- and intra-individual variability in dosage. Compared with dosing solely based on clinical information, pharmacogenetics can help improve the therapy with coumarins by decreasing the time to reach a stable dose and reducing the risk of bleeding. Most of the studies about genotyping of patients using vitamin K antagonists have focused on predicting the stable dose. Two genes have been shown to have the most influence on dosing: VKORC1 and CYP2C9. Furthermore, genotyping of more genes, such as CYP4F2 and APOE, is also being included in some dosing algorithms. The role of genotype beyond the initial dose-titration phase is less clear. Thus, a proven genetically determined risk of unstable dose or bleeding could help with the selection of patients who require more frequent monitoring of dose. On the other hand, patients who have a genetically determined stable dose could self-monitor their international normalized ratio (INR), making the therapy less expensive and more convenient.
