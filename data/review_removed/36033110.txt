Conversion Disorder in a Pharmacogenomics, Polypharmacy Patient: Case Report.
<b>Background:</b> Conversion disorder (CD) is a relatively common psychiatric disorder likely encountered by clinical pharmacists but probably not easily identified by pharmacists. <b>Case Summary:</b> This is a patient case where a patient with a tremor was referred to the pharmacist led, polypharmacy, pharmacogenomics (PGx) service to rule out a PGx cause due to medication metabolism. No pharmacologic or PGx cause was found for the tremor which helped support and confirm a diagnosis of CD. <b>Practice Implications:</b> By working collaboratively with psychiatrists, neurologists, physical medicine colleagues, clinical pharmacists may add value to patient care by assisting with diagnoses and appropriate treatment.
