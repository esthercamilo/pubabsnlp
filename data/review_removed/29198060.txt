No major role of norepinephrine transporter gene variations in the cardiostimulant effects of MDMA.
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is used recreationally and frequently leads to sympathomimetic toxicity. MDMA produces cardiovascular and subjective stimulant effects that were shown to partially depend on the norepinephrine transporter (NET)-mediated release of norepinephrine and stimulation of Î±<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors. Genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of the NET gene (SLC6A2) may explain interindividual differences in the acute stimulant-type responses to MDMA in humans.
