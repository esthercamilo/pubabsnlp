OPRM1 c.118A>G Polymorphism and Duration of Morphine Treatment Associated with Morphine Doses and Quality-of-Life in Palliative Cancer Pain Settings.
Despite increased attention on assessment and management, pain remains the most persistent symptom in patients with cancer, in particular in end-of-life settings, with detrimental impact on their quality-of-life (QOL). We conducted this study to evaluate the added value of determining some genetic and non-genetic factors to optimize cancer pain treatment. Eighty-nine patients were included in the study for the evaluation of palliative cancer pain management. The regression analysis showed that age, <i>OPRM1</i> single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), as well as the duration of morphine treatment were significantly associated with morphine doses at 24 h (given by infusion pump; <i>p</i> = 0.043, 0.029, and <0.001, respectively). The mean doses of morphine decreased with age but increased with the duration of morphine treatment. In addition, patients with AG genotype c.118A>G <i>OPRM1</i> needed a higher dose of morphine than AA patients. Moreover, metastases, <i>OPRM1</i> SNP, age, and gender were significantly associated with the QOL in our population. In particular, AA patients for <i>OPRM1</i> SNP had significantly lower cognitive function than AG patients, a result not previously reported in the literature. These findings could help increase the effectiveness of morphine treatment and enhance the QOL of patients in regards to personalized medicine.
