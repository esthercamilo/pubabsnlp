Impact of the OATP1B1 c.521T>C single nucleotide polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics of exemestane in healthy post-menopausal female volunteers.
OATP1B1 mediates the transport of a diverse range of amphiphilic organic compounds that include bile acids, steroid conjugates and hormones. This retrospective pharmacogenetic study was conducted to assess the impact of the OATP1B1 c.521T>C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on the pharmacokinetics of the steroidal aromatase inhibitor drug exemestane in healthy volunteers.
