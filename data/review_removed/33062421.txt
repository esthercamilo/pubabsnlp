Differential effects of cisplatin on cybrid cells with varying mitochondrial DNA haplogroups.
Drug therapy yields different results depending on its recipient population. Cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent, causes different levels of resistance and side effects for different patients, but the mechanism(s) are presently unknown. It has been assumed that this variation is a consequence of differences in nuclear (n) DNA, epigenetics, or some external factor(s). There is accumulating evidence that an individual's mitochondrial (mt) DNA may play a role in their response to medications. Variations within mtDNA can be observed, and an individual's mtDNA can be categorized into haplogroups that are defined by accumulations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) representing different ethnic populations.
