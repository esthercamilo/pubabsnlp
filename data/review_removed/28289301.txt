Design, Implementation, and Assessment Approaches Within a Pharmacogenomics Course.
<b>Objective.</b> To design and implement a pharmacogenomics course that focuses on analysis and integration of pharmacogenomic data into clinical practice and to explore how participation in the course influences student self-confidence. <b>Design.</b> The Basic and Clinical Pharmacogenomics course content was divided into three modules: genetic-based didactic sessions, genomic techniques and self-genotype/phenotype laboratory exercise, and clinical-based case studies. Student learning assessment included knowledge- and application-based tests and performance on a group project. <b>Assessment.</b> Effectiveness of the course was evaluated using results of student performance on coded test questions, student perceptions on pre- and post-course self-assessments, performance on a group project, and course evaluation results. Student pharmacists successfully demonstrated competency in pharmacogenomics knowledge-based learning, demonstrated their abilities to apply learned skills in clinical-based scenarios, and reported improved confidence in analyzing patient-based genomic testing results. <b>Conclusions.</b> This course appears to have contributed to student learning and positively influenced student self-confidence in pharmacogenomics.
