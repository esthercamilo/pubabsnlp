Effect of gene variants on opioid dose, pain and adverse effect outcomes in advanced cancer: an explorative study.
<b>Aim:</b> Associations between gene variants and opioid net effect are unclear. We conducted an exploratory pharmacogenetic analysis of 35 gene variants and opioid response in advanced cancer. <b>Patients & methods:</b> This multi-center prospective cohort study included clinical data, questionnaires (pain and adverse effects) and DNA (blood). Negative binomial regression and logistic regression were used. <b>Results:</b> Within 54 participants, eight statistically significant associations (p = 0.002-0.038) were observed between gene variants and opioid dose, pain scores or adverse effects, the majority being within the neuroimmune TLR4 pathway (IL1B [rs1143634], IL2 [rs2069762], IL6 [rs1800795], BDNF [rs6265]) and ARRB2 pathway (ARRB2 [rs3786047], DRD2 [rs6275]). <b>Conclusion:</b> Neuroimmune pathway genes may contribute to differences in opioid response in cancer and may be included in future similar studies.
