Detection accuracy and clinical applications of DP-TOF mass spectrometry.
Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is currently used in clinical microbiology laboratories. This study aimed to determine whether dual-polarity time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DP-TOF MS) could be applied to clinical nucleotide detection.
