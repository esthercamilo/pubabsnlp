Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacogenomics of Ribociclib in Black Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer: The LEANORA study.
Underrepresented populations' participation in clinical trials remains limited, and the potential impact of genomic variants on drug metabolism remains elusive. This study aimed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenomics (PGx) of ribociclib in self-identified Black women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2) advanced breast cancer. LEANORA (NCT04657679) was a prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study involving 14 Black women. PK and PGx were evaluated using tandem mass spectrometry and PharmacoScan™ microarray (including <i>CYP3A5*3</i> , <i>*6</i> , and <i>*7</i> ). CYP3A5 phenotypes varied among participants: 7 poor metabolizers (PM), 6 intermediate metabolizers (IM), and one normal metabolizer (NM). The area-under-the-curve did not significantly differ between PMs (39,230 hr*ng/mL) and IM/NMs (43,546 hr*ng/mL; p = 0.38). The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was also similar. We found no association between <i>CYP3A5</i> genotype and ribociclib exposure. Continued efforts are needed to include diverse populations in clinical trials to ensure equitable treatment outcomes.
