Genomics and multimorbidity.
Multimorbidity has increased in prevalence world-wide. It is anticipated to affect over 1 in 6 of the UK population by 2035 and is now recognised as a global priority for health research. Genomic medicine has rapidly advanced over the last 20Â years from the first sequencing of the human genome to integration into clinical care for rarer conditions. Genetic studies help identify new disease mechanisms as they are less susceptible to the bias and confounding that affects epidemiological studies, as genetics are assigned from conception. There is also genetic variation in the efficacy of medications and the risk of side effects, pharmacogenetics. Genomic approaches offer the potential to improve our understanding of mechanisms underpinning multiple long-term conditions/multimorbidity and guide precision approaches to risk, diagnosis and optimisation of management. In this commentary as part of the Age and Ageing 50th anniversary commentary series, we summarise genomics and the potential utility of genomics in multimorbidity.
