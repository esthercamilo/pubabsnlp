[Genetic tests in oncology: from identification of high risk groups to therapy].
The development of genetic epidemiology in oncology has made possible more frequent analysis of high risk groups, allowing the development of promising susceptibility indicators. The main public health implications include screening and new perspectives for pharmacogenetics and nutrigenomics. The study of genetic variants allows the evaluation of individual risk of developing a disease and has important implications in primary and secondary prevention programs. The analysis of somatic mutations present in tumour cells may contribute to selecting the optimal treatment on an individual basis and to reducing the occurrence of adverse effects of chemotherapy. The authors give a summary of the state of the art of this field and analyze the potential applications of genetic tests in oncology, from identification of high risk groups to defining individualized therapies with particular emphasis on implications for prevention.
