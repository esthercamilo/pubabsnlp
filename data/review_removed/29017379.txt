HLA-associated drug hypersensitivity and the prediction of adverse drug reactions.
Adverse drug reactions are an important cause of morbidity and mortality and constitute the leading reason of drug withdrawal from the market. Besides classical reactions that are related to pharmacologic activity of the drug, some reactions are unpredictable, not dose dependent, and seem to occur in genetically predisposed individuals. The majority of this reaction is immunologically driven and they are referred to as hypersensitivity reactions. A growing number of studies provided evidences that specific HLA alleles increase the risk of developing hypersensitivity drug reactions. In this context, drug hypersensitivities that have more robust pharmacogenetic data include abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome and severe cutaneous adverse reactions induced by allopurinol and carbamazepine.
