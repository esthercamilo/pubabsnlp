Influence of ABCB11 and HNF4Î± genes on daclatasvir plasma concentration: preliminary pharmacogenetic data from the Kineti-C study.
Daclatasvir is an inhibitor of HCV non-structural 5A protein and is a P-glycoprotein substrate. Pharmacogenetics has had a great impact on previous anti-HCV therapies, particularly considering the association of IL-28B polymorphisms with dual therapy outcome.
