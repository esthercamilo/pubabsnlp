Effect of <i>CYP2D6*4</i>, <i>CYP2D6*10</i> polymorphisms on the safety of treatment with timolol maleate in patients with glaucoma.
Timolol maleate is used for the treatment of glaucoma and metabolized by cytochrome CYP2D6 in the liver. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the influence of <i>CYP2D6*4</i> and <i>CYP2D6*10</i> gene polymorphisms on the safety of medications containing 0.5% of timolol maleate as glaucoma treatment in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
