How can we improve on the already impressive results in pediatric ALL?
The past 70 years have seen childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia move from a fatal disease with a survival of barely 4 months to a curable disease in >85% of patients. It has become clear that as treatment has intensified, more children are cured but at the expense of increased toxicity which for some can cause significant long-term morbidity and even mortality. The drive in more recent years has been to identify sensitive markers of disease and response to treatment to allow a reduction in therapy in those who do not require it and more intensive treatment in those who do. Clinical characteristics have been used to stratify patients into different risk groups and this, coupled with following response at a molecular level, has done much to tailor treatment to the patient. Considerable research has been focused on the molecular characteristics of the leukemia itself to elucidate the biologic mechanisms underlying both the disease and the comparative or absolute resistance of some types of leukemia. These molecular markers can also act as targets for novel therapies, which require newer trial methodologies to prove their utility. There has been less focus on the biology of the patient but it is clear that some patients are more susceptible to adverse events and toxicities than others. Through the use of pharmacogenomics, modification to therapy may be appropriate in certain patients based on their genetic profile. As novel therapies become available, suitable controlled trials in children are essential for their safe use in this population and will ensure that children are not denied timely access to advances in treatment.
