The prevalence of pharmacogenetic variants of vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 gene (rs9923231), cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C member 9 gene (rs1799853) and cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily-A member-5 gene (rs776746) among 13 ethnic groups of Pakistan.
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) plays a central role in the selection of targeted therapies that underpins precision-medicine. We investigated the prevalence of three important pharmacogenetic variants of VKORC1, CYP2C9, and CYP3A5 genes among Pakistani populations.
