Pharmacogenetics of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors in a Taiwanese population with type 2 diabetes.
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs enabling effective glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite DPP-4 inhibitors' advantages, the patients' therapeutic response varies. In this retrospective cohort study, 171 Taiwanese patients with T2D were classified as sensitive or resistant to treatment based on the mean change in HbA1c levels. Using an assumption-free genome-wide association study, 45 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in the therapeutic response to DPP-4 inhibitors (P < 1 × 10-4) were identified at or near PRKD1, CNTN3, ASK, and LOC10537792. A SNP located within the fourth intron of PRKD1 (rs57803087) was strongly associated with DPP-4 inhibitor response (P = 3.2 × 10-6). This is the first pharmacogenomics study on DPP-4 inhibitor treatment for diabetes in a Taiwanese population. Our data suggest that genes associated with β-cell function and apoptosis are involved in the therapeutic effect of DPP-4 inhibitors, even in the presence of additional oral anti-diabetic drugs. Our findings provide information on how genetic variants influence drug response and may benefit the development of personalized medicine.
