Toward Personalized Medicine Implementation: Survey of Military Medicine Providers in the Area of Pharmacogenomics.
Personalized medicine is the right treatment, to the right patient, at the right dose. Knowledge of genetic predisposition to variable metabolism and distribution of drugs within the body is currently available as pharmacogenomic testing and is one of the pillars of personalized medicine. Pharmacogenomic testing is growing. It has become part of guidelines for dosing on FDA labels and has been used by health care organizations to improve outcomes and reduce adverse events. Additionally, it has been FDA approved for direct-to-consumer purchase and has been cause of concern of patient self-dosing and medication changes. Presumably in the near future, pharmacogenomics will be impressed upon the military health system (MHS) provider from either a top-down, command requested, or from a bottom-up, patient requested, approach. To date, widespread implementation of pharmacogenomic testing does not seem to be established within the MHS. This survey sheds light on the knowledge, exposure, use, comfort, and interest among family medicine providers in the MHS. It compares similar results in other national and international surveys and compares results among a small subset of residents to staff.
