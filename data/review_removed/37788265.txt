Analytical validation of GenoPharm a clinical genotyping open array panel of 46 pharmacogenes inclusive of variants unique to people of African ancestry.
Pharmacogenomic testing may be used to improve treatment outcomes and reduce the frequency of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Population specific, targeted pharmacogenetics (PGx) panel-based testing methods enable sensitive, accurate and economical implementation of precision medicine. We evaluated the analytical performance of the GenoPharm® custom open array platform which evaluates 120 SNPs across 46 pharmacogenes. Using commercially available reference samples (Coriell Biorepository) and in-house extracted DNA, we assessed accuracy, precision, and linearity of GenoPharm®. We then used GenoPharm® on 218 samples from two Southern African black populations and determined allele and genotype frequencies for selected actionable variants. Across all assays, the GenoPharm® panel demonstrated 99.5% concordance with the Coriell reference samples, with 98.9% reproducibility. We observed high frequencies of key genetic variants in people of African ancestry: CYP2B6*6 (0.35), CYP2C9*8, *11 (0.13, 0.03), CYP2D6*17 (0.21) and *29 (0.11). GenoPharm® open array is therefore an accurate, reproducible and sensitive test that can be used for clinical pharmacogenetic testing and is inclusive of variants specific to the people of African ancestry.
