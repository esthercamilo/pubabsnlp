Pharmacogenomics of Methotrexate Pathway in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: Approach toward Personalized Medicine.
Background: Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most common medications used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could potentially predict variability in therapeutic outcomes. Aim: This study aims to assess the impact of SNPs in genes encoding for the MTX pathway for predicting clinical and therapeutic responses to MTX in a cohort of Egyptian patients with RA. Subjects and Methods: Data from 107 Egyptian RA patients (aged 44.4 ± 11.4 years) treated with MTX monotherapy, for a duration of 3.7 ± 3.3 years, were collected. Genotypes of 10 SNPs from four different genes were analyzed using the allelic discrimination PCR technique. Results: The ATIC rs3821353 G/T (p = 0.034) and the C/T and C/C of SLC19A1 rs7279445 (p = 0.0018) were associated with a non-response to MTX, while DHFR rs10072026 C/T and C/C were associated with a good response (p < 0.001). Carriers of the ATIC rs382135 3 G (p = 0.001) and ATIC rs4673990 G (p < 0.001) alleles were more likely to develop RA, while the SLC19A1 rs11702425 T (p < 0.001) and GGH rs12681874 T (p = 0.003) allele carriers were more likely to be protected against RA. Carriers of the ATIC rs4673990 A/G genotype (p < 0.001) were at risk of developing RA, while carriers of the following genotypes were mostly protected against RA: ATIC rs3821353 T/T (p < 0.001), ATIC rs3821353 G/G (p = 0.004), SLC19A1 rs11702425 T/T (p = 0.001), SLC19A1 rs11702425 C/T (p = 0.003), GGH rs12681874 C/T (p = 0.004) and GGH rs12681874 T/T (0.002). Conclusion: The genotyping of genes involved in the MTX pathway may be helpful to predict which RA patients will/will not benefit from MTX, and thus, may help to apply a personalized medicine approach in RA.
