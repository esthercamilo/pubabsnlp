Therapeutic efficacy of generic artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Ghana: assessing anti-malarial efficacy amidst pharmacogenetic variations.
Despite efforts made to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with malaria, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, malaria continues to be a public health concern that requires innovative efforts to reach the WHO-set zero malaria agenda. Among the innovations is the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) that is effective against Plasmodium falciparum. Generic artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is used to treat uncomplicated malaria after appropriate diagnosis. AL is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, such as CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which can be under pharmacogenetic influence. Pharmacogenetics affecting AL metabolism, significantly influence the overall anti-malarial activity leading to variable therapeutic efficacy. This study focused on generic AL drugs used in malarial treatment as prescribed at health facilities and evaluated pharmacogenomic influences on their efficacy.
