Thirty years of neuroendocrinology: Technological advances pave the way for molecular discovery.
Since the 1950s, the systems level interactions between the hypothalamus, pituitary and end organs such as the adrenal, thyroid and gonads have been well known; however, it is only over the last three decades that advances in molecular biology and information technology have provided a tremendous expansion of knowledge at the molecular level. Neuroendocrinology has benefitted from developments in molecular genetics, epigenetics and epigenomics, and most recently optogenetics and pharmacogenetics. This has enabled a new understanding of gene regulation, transcription, translation and post-translational regulation, which should help direct the development of drugs to treat neuroendocrine-related diseases.
