Singapore Pharmacogenomics Portal: a web resource for evaluating human genetic variations of genes responsible for drug responses.
The Singapore Pharmacogenomics Portal is the first genomics web platform that links public resources from PharmGKB and DrugBank with population genetics data from the International HapMap Project and the Singapore Genome Variation Project. The web portal provides the opportunity to survey genetic differences across populations for all autosomal genes in the genome, and serves as an integrated platform for linking these data with drugs and genetic variants that affect drug responses, adverse reactions, and dosage requirements. We envisage that the information provided by the portal will be useful to drug regulators and clinical researchers when evaluating the transferability of results from clinical trials conducted in one population to other populations for which no direct clinical testing has been conducted. The utility of this resource may extend to other countries in the region that also have significant populations of Chinese, Malay, or Indian ancestry.
