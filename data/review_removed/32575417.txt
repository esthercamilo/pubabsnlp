The Role of MET Inhibitor Therapies in the Treatment of Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
<b>Introduction</b>: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the second most common cancer globally. The mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) proto-oncogene can be targeted in NSCLC patients. <b>Methods</b>: We performed a literature search on PubMed in December 2019 for studies on MET inhibitors and NSCLC. Phase II and III clinical trials published in English between 2014 and 2019 were selected. <b>Results</b>: Data on MET inhibitors (tivantinib, cabozantinib, and crizotinib) and anti-MET antibodies (emibetuzumab and onartuzumab) are reported in the text. <b>Conclusion</b>: Emibetuzumab could be used for NSCLC cases with high <i>MET</i> expression. Further, studies on onartuzumab failed to prove its efficacy, while the results of tivantinib trials were clinically but not statistically significant. Additionally, cabozantinib was effective, but adverse reactions were common, and crizotinib was generally well-tolerated.
