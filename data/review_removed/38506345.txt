KnowledgeÂ and perceptions of pharmacogenomics among pharmacists in Manitoba, Canada.
<b>Objective:</b> This work was designed to describe the knowledge and perceptions of pharmacogenomics (PGx) among pharmacists in the Canadian province of Manitoba. <b>Methods:</b> A 40-item, web-based survey was distributed to pharmacists in Manitoba. <b>Results:</b> Of 74 participants, one third had some education or training in PGx, and 12.2% had used PGx test results in their practice. Participants' self-rated knowledge of PGx testing and common PGx resources (e.g., Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base, Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium) was low. Most pharmacists surveyed believe that PGx can improve medication efficacy (82.4%) or prevent adverse drug reactions (81.1%). Most (91%) desired more education on PGx. <b>Conclusion:</b> Manitoba pharmacists reported positive perceptions toward PGx. However, they are currently underprepared to implement PGx into practice.
