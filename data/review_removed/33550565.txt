Pharmacogenetics of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: An Evidence-Update.
Pharmacogenetics has become increasingly important in the treatment of psychiatric disorders because approximately 50% of individuals who take psychotropic medications do not typically respond to them. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one such chronic and often debilitating mental illness with significant non-response to even the first-line medication, serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Precision medicine utilizing genetic testing panels has received significant attention based on the evidence that the variability of antidepressant response and adverse effects is partly due to the variability in an individual's genome. Thus, extensive research has investigated the role of genetic factors on antidepressant response in major depressive disorder (MDD) and their utility for guiding antidepressant treatment to significantly improving outcomes in individuals with MDD. However, limited progress remains in the pharmacogenetics of OCD. This chapter will provide an overview of the recent findings in the pharmacogenetics of OCD. Promising results with limited replications have been reported for the cytochrome P450 liver metabolism genes in addition to several serotonergic and glutamatergic system genes, which may play an important role in antidepressant response in the treatment of OCD.
