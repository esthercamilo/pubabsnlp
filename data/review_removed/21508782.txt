ACOG Committee Opinion No. 488: Pharmacogenetics.
Pharmacogenetics is the study of genetic variations in drug response that are determined by specific genes. It is hoped that the use of pharmacogenetics in clinical practice may improve drug safety and decrease the rate of adverse drug reactions. Given the potential applications of pharmacogenetics to women's health care, obstetricians and gynecologists should be aware of this rapidly developing field. Currently, however, there are limited clinical indications for the use of pharmacogenetics in routine obstetric and gynecologic practice.
