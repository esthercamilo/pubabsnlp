Pharmacogenomics panel test for prevention toxicity in patient who receive Fluoropirimidine/Oxaliplatin-based therapy.
Both Fluoropirimidine and Oxaliplatin (FluOx) are the most common anticancer drugs used to treat lung, colorectal, ovarian, breast, head/neck, and genitourinary cancers. However, the efficacy of FluOx-based therapy is often compromised because of the severe risk of toxicity. Stratification of patients for multidrug response is a promising strategy for cancer treatment and personalized therapy.
