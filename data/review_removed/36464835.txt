Genetic variants found in paediatric oncology patients with severe chemotherapy-induced toxicity: A case series.
Paediatric oncology patients who develop severe chemotherapy-induced toxicity that requires dose reduction, delay or termination of treatment are at risk of decreased treatment efficacy. Previous research has provided evidence that genetic variants in <i>TPMT, NUDT15, UGT1A1</i> and <i>DPYD</i> are associated with toxicity of anticancer drugs. This led to pharmacogenetic guidelines that are integrated into clinical practice in paediatric oncology. Recently, novel genetic variants have been associated with a higher risk of developing chemotherapy-induced toxicity. In this case series, we selected 21 novel variants and genotyped these in nine patients with excessive chemotherapy-induced toxicity using whole exome sequencing or micro-array data. We observed that six out of nine patients carried at least one variant that, according to recent studies, potentially increased the risk of developing methotrexate- or vincristine-induced toxicity. As patient-derived genetic data are becoming widely accessible in paediatric oncology, these variants could potentially enter clinical practice to mitigate chemotherapy-induced toxicity.
