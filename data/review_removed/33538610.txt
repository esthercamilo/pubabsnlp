Pharmacogenomics education and perceptions: is there a gap between internal medicine resident and attending physicians?
<b>Aim:</b> To determine if differences in self-reported pharmacogenomics knowledge, skills and perceptions exist between internal medicine residents and attending physicians. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Forty-six internal medicine residents and 54 attending physicians completed surveys. Thirteen participated in focus groups to explore themes emerging from the surveys. <b>Results:</b> Resident physicians reported a greater amount of pharmacogenomics training compared with attending physicians (48 vs 13%, p < 0.00012). No differences were found in self-reported knowledge, skills and perceptions. <b>Conclusion:</b> Both groups expressed pharmacogenomics was relevant to their current clinical practice; they should be able to provide information to patients and use to guide prescribing, but lacked sufficient education to be able to do so effectively. Practical approaches are needed to teach pharmacogenomics concepts and address point of care gaps.
