Acute kidney injury in a preterm infant homozygous for the C3435T polymorphism in the ABCB1 gene given oral morphine.
A 34-week infant born from a mother with a history of drug abuse developed neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in the first hours of life. Urine drug screening was positive for cocaine and heroin. The infant developed acute kidney injury and bilateral hydronephrosis while receiving oral morphine for control of NAS. Cessation of morphine therapy and urinary catheterization resulted in a rapid and complete resolution of the symptoms. Our patient was homozygous for the C3435T polymorphism in the ABCB1 gene, a polymorphism previously associated with impaired P-glycoprotein activity. We hypothesize that acute renal toxicity was related to accumulation of morphine within urothelial cells due to genetically determined impaired P-glycoprotein activity.
