Challenges in pharmacotherapy for older adults: a framework for pharmacogenomics implementation.
Older adults are at high risk for inappropriate prescribing, developing polypharmacy, adverse drug events and poor treatment outcomes due to multimorbidity and geriatric syndromes. Pharmacogenomics could allow healthcare professionals to provide optimal patient care while minimizing the risk of adverse drug events and simplifying complex medication regimens. The implementation of pharmacogenomics in geriatrics medicine requires a broad multilayered bottom-up approach. These include curriculum redesign, rethinking experiential education and patient and provider education. There are barriers associated with adopting pharmacogenomics into clinical practice. These barriers may include economic factors, workflow and informatics support. However, addressing these barriers primarily requires creating a culture of innovative practices in patient care, ongoing interprofessional continuing education and an interdisciplinary approach for patient care.
