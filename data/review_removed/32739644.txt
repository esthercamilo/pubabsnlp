Pharmacogenetics in psychiatric care, a call for uptake of available applications.
In this narrative, we evaluate the role of pharmacogenetics in psychiatry from a pragmatic clinical perspective and address current barriers of clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics. Pharmacogenetics has been successfully implemented to improve drug therapy in several clinical areas, but not psychiatry. Yet, psychotropics account for more than one-third of the drugs for which pharmacogenetic guidelines are available and drug therapy in mental disorders is suboptimal with insufficient effectiveness and frequent adverse events. The limited application of pharmacogenetics in psychiatry is influenced by several factors; e.g. the complexity of psychotropic drug metabolism, possibly impeding the clinical understanding of the benefits of pharmacogenetics. Also, recommendations for most psychotropics classify pharmacogenetic testing only as (potentially) beneficial, not as essential, possibly because life-threatening adverse events are often not involved in these drug-gene interactions. Implementing pharmacogenetics in psychiatry could improve the current practice of time-consuming switching of therapies causing undue delays associated with worse outcomes. We expect pharmacogenetics in psychiatry to expedite with panel-based genotyping, including clinically relevant variants, which will address the complex enzymatic metabolism of psychotropic drugs. Until then, we stress that available pharmacogenetic testing should be seen as an integrated companion, not a competitor, in current clinical psychiatric care.
