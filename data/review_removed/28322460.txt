Dapsone-induced agranulocytosis-possible involvement of low-activity N-acetyltransferase 2.
Dapsone-induced agranulocytosis is a rare but potentially fatal adverse drug reaction (ADR). A 45-year-old male Caucasian patient developed agranulocytosis caused by dapsone (diamino-diphenyl sulfone), which he was prescribed for leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Patient's treatment consisted of termination of dapsone, antibiotic therapy, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor leading to prompt improvement of symptoms and normalization of laboratory blood values. Diagnostic evaluation revealed methemoglobinemia and excluded glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Pharmacogenetics testing showed that he was a carrier of NAT2 *5/*6 genotype, predisposing to low activity of the N-acetyltransferase 2 enzyme. This was the first and only ADR to dapsone reported in Croatia. In total, there have been 73 ADR to dapsone recorded worldwide, including only four cases of agranulocytosis.
