Novel associations between <i>CYP2B6</i> polymorphisms, perioperative methadone metabolism and clinical outcomes in children.
<b>Aim:</b> Methadone exhibits significant variability in clinical response. This study explores the genetic influence of variable methadone pharmacokinetics. <b>Methods:</b> This is a prospective study of methadone in children undergoing major surgery. <i>CYP2B6</i> genotyping, plasma methadone and metabolite levels were obtained. Clinical outcomes include pain scores and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). <b>Results:</b><i>CYP2B6</i> poor metabolizers (*6/*6) had >twofold lower methadone metabolism compared with normal/rapid metabolizers. The incidence of PONV was 4.7× greater with <i>CYP2B6 rs1038376</i> variant. <i>AG/GG</i> variants of <i>rs2279343</i> SNP had 2.86-fold higher incidence of PONV compared with the wild variant (<i>AA</i>). Nominal associations between <i>rs10500282, rs11882424</i>, <i>rs4803419</i> and pain scores were observed. <b>Conclusion:</b> We have described novel associations between <i>CYP2B6</i> genetic variants and perioperative methadone metabolism, and associations with pain scores and PONV.
