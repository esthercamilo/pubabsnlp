Towards low cost, multiplex clinical genotyping: 4-fluorescent Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR and its application on pharmacogenetics.
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is associated with efficacy of specific drugs. Although there are several methods for SNP genotyping in clinical settings, alternative methods with lower cost, higher throughout and less complexity are still needed. In this study, we modified Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR to enable multiplex SNP genotyping by introducing additional fluorescent cassettes that specifically help to differentiate more amplification signals in a single reaction. This new format of assay achieved a limit of detection down to 310 copies/ reactions for simultaneous detection of 2 SNPs with only standard end-point PCR workflow for synthetic controls, and genotyped 117 clinical samples with results that were in 100% agreement with hospital reports. This study presented a simplified, cost-effective high-throughput SNP genotyping alternative for pharmacogenetic variants, and enabled easier access to pharmaceutical guidance when needed.
