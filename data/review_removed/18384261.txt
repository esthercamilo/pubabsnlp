Helicos BioSciences.
Helicos BioSciences Corporation is a life sciences company developing revolutionary new single molecule sequencing technology to provide the path to the US$1000 genome. True Single Molecule Sequencing (tSMS) will drive advancements in pharmacogenomics that can enable a better understanding of an individual's susceptibility to disease, develop more effective disease diagnoses and differentiate response to disease therapies. During 2007, genome-wide disease-association studies, the encylopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) and the published genome sequence of two individuals have revealed human genome variation far more extensive than originally believed. These also demonstrated that common variations explain only a fraction of the genetic basis of disease. Therefore, the capability to understand an individual genome is critical in setting the foundation for the next great revolution in healthcare. Helicos is committed to this vision and will provide cost-effective genome sequencing and comprehensive analysis of the transcribed genome that can unlock the era of personalized healthcare.
