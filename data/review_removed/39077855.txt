Pharmacogenetics in Oncology: A useful tool for individualizing drug therapy.
With the continuous development of genetics in healthcare, there has been a significant contribution to the development of precision medicine, which is ultimately aimed at improving the care of patients. Generally, drug treatments used in Oncology are characterized by a narrow therapeutic range and by their potential toxicity. Knowledge of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics can be very useful in the area of Oncology, as they constitute additional tools that can help to individualize patients' treatment. This work includes a description of some genes that have been revealed to be useful in the field of Oncology, as they play a role in drug prescription and in the prediction of treatment response.
