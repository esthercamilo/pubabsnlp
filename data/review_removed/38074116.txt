Single-nucleotide polymorphism profiling by multimodal-targeted next-generation sequencing in methotrexate-resistant and -sensitive human osteosarcoma cell lines.
<b>Introduction:</b> Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most important drugs included in the first-line protocols to treat high-grade osteosarcoma (HGOS). Although several polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with drug response or MTX-related toxicity in pharmacogenetic studies, their role in the development of MTX resistance in HGOS is still unclear. <b>Methods:</b> Therefore, in this study, 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 4 genes of the folate metabolism, 7 MTX transporter genes, and 2 SNPs of the tumor protein p53 (<i>TP53</i>) gene were investigated using a custom multimodal-targeted next-generation sequencing (mmNGS) approach in 8 MTX-resistant and 12 MTX-sensitive human HGOS cell lines. The panel was validated by TaqMan genotyping assays. <b>Results:</b> High instability of TP53 rs1642785 was observed in all U-2OS/MTX variants. Allele changes of the solute carrier family 19 member 1/replication factor C subunit 1 (SLC19A1, previously known as RFC1) and rs1051266 were identified in all Saos-2/MTX-resistant variants in both DNA- and RNA- derived libraries compared to the parental Saos-2 cell line. Allele changes of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rs1801133 were identified only in the RNA-derived libraries of the two U2OS variants with the highest MTX resistance level. Significantly upregulated gene expression associated with the development of MTX resistance was revealed for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) whereas SLC19A1 was downregulated. In addition, a fusion transcript of DHFR (ex4) and MutS Homolog 3 (MSH3) (ex9) was identified in the RNA libraries derived from the two U-2OS variants with the highest MTX resistance level. <b>Conclusion:</b> This innovative mmNGS approach enabled the simultaneous exploration of SNPs at DNA and RNA levels in human HGOS cell lines, providing evidence of the functional involvement of allele changes associated with the development of MTX resistance.
