Clinical and molecular characteristics of colombian patients with mucopolysaccharidosis IVA, and description of a new galns gene mutation.
A study published in 2012 estimated incidence of MPS IVA, in 0.68 cases per 100, 000 live births in Colombia, and according to the Colombian Fund for High-Cost Diseases, in 2014 there were 15 people diagnosed with MPS IV. To enhance the knowledge of the disease in the country, we aimed to characterize clinical and molecular findings in 12 MPS IVA patients. Twelve patients were included in the study, with most patients of female gender (<i>n</i> = 7, 58,3%), age range 2 to 28 years, average weight 26 kg (17.6-43 kg), average height 97 cm (92-104 cm), average BMI 27.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (19.92-47.65 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Clinical findings were similar to those described in the literature. GALNS gene molecular analysis showed five homozygous missense mutations in exon 11 c.1156C > T or p.R386C, a single nonsense mutation in the heterozygous state c.974G > A p.W325, and heterozygous in exon 9 mutation of exon 3 c.280C > T p.R94C, missense variant reported by Ogawa in 1995 [17]. There was only one patient that presented a homozygous missense mutation in exon 9 c.901G > T p.G301C and four patients showed the heterozygous form. A heterozygous missense mutation in exon 5 c.425A > T p.H142L, which has not been previously reported, was found in a female patient, 2 years 11 months of age. The diagnosis algorithms that include molecular analysis, bioinformatic predictive tools, pharmacogenomics, and proteomics helps to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients affected by MPS IVA.
