The pharmacological advantage of prolonged dose rate gemcitabine is restricted to patients with variant alleles of cytidine deaminase c.79A>C.
Controversy exists over the optimal dosing for the nucleoside analogue gemcitabine. A pharmacological advantage is achieved by prolonging infusion times but evidence for a clinical benefit has been conflicting. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in genes involved in gemcitabine accumulation, particularly the cytidine deaminase CDA c.79A>C, may influence the optimal dosing regimen in individual patients.
