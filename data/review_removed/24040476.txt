PDLIM5 gene polymorphisms and short term antidepressant response in Chinese major depressive disorders.
Several investigations have suggested that PDLIM5 plays a key role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), and that PDLIM5 might be a therapeutic target for the action of antidepressant. In this study, we sought to investigate whether variations of PDLIM5 gene sequence could predict response to antidepressants in MDD patients. We selected 3 SNPs (rs10008257, rs2433320, 2452600) of PDLIM5 gene, and performed an association analysis of PDLIM5 and the efficacy of fluoxetine treatment in 185 Han Chinese MDD patients. The results show that the rs2433320 of PDLIM5 gene are associated with fluoxetine therapeutic response in MDD patients (X(2) = 8.2960, df = 2, P = 0.0145) after correction with the Bonferroni multiple test, the HAMD score of the GG genotype group was significantly lower than that of the AA and AG genotype group at 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks. The results support the idea that the PDLIM5 gene is likely to be involved in the antidepressant response in MDD.
