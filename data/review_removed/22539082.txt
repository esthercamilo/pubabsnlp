Deriving rules and assertions from pharmacogenomics knowledge resources in support of patient drug metabolism efficacy predictions.
Pharmacogenomics evaluations of variability in drug metabolic processes may be useful for making individual drug response predictions. We present an approach to deriving 'phenotype scores' based on existing pharmacogenomics knowledge and a patient's genomics data. Pharmacogenomics plays an important role in the bioactivation of tamoxifen, a prodrug administered to patients for breast cancer treatment. Tamoxifen is therefore considered a model for many drugs requiring bioactivation. We investigate whether this knowledge-based approach can be applied to produce a phenotype score that is predictive of the endoxifen/N-desmethyltamoxifen (NDM) plasma concentration ratio in patients taking tamoxifen.
