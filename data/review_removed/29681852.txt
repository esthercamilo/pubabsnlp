Genotypic and Phenotypic Factors Influencing Drug Response in Mexican Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
The treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) consists primarily of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) that stimulate insulin secretion, such as sulfonylureas (SUs) and reduce hepatic glucose production (e.g., biguanides), among others. The marked inter-individual differences among T2DM patients' response to these drugs have become an issue on prescribing and dosing efficiently. In this study, fourteen polymorphisms selected from Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were screened in 495 T2DM Mexican patients previously treated with OADs to find the relationship between the presence of these polymorphisms and response to the OADs. Then, a novel association screening method, based on global probabilities, was used to globally characterize important relationships between the drug response to OADs and genetic and clinical parameters, including polymorphisms, patient information, and type of treatment. Two polymorphisms, <i>ABCC8</i>-Ala1369Ser and <i>KCNJ11</i>-Glu23Lys, showed a significant impact on response to SUs. Heterozygous <i>ABCC8</i>-Ala1369Ser variant (A/C) carriers exhibited a higher response to SUs compared to homozygous <i>ABCC8</i>-Ala1369Ser variant (A/A) carriers (<i>p</i>-value = 0.029) and to homozygous wild-type genotypes (C/C) (<i>p</i>-value = 0.012). The homozygous <i>KCNJ11</i>-Glu23Lys variant (C/C) and wild-type (T/T) genotypes had a lower response to SUs compared to heterozygous (C/T) carriers (<i>p</i>-value = 0.039). The screening of OADs response related genetic and clinical factors could help improve the prescribing and dosing of OADs for T2DM patients and thus contribute to the design of personalized treatments.
