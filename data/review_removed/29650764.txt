Genetic Variants Influencing Plasma Renin Activity in Hypertensive Patients From the PEAR Study (Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses).
Plasma renin is an important regulator of blood pressure (BP). Plasma renin activity (PRA) has been shown to correlate with variability in BP response to antihypertensive agents. We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with baseline PRA using data from the PEAR study (Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses).
