Pharmacogenetics of coumarin dosing: prevalence of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms in the Lebanese population.
Polymorphisms in the genes encoding the cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme (CYP2C9) and the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1) are known to contribute to variability in sensitivity to coumarins. Patients with certain common genetic variants of CYP2C9 (*2 & *3) or a VKORC1 polymorphism (-1639A Allele) require a lower dose of coumarin and are also at higher risk for over-anticoagulation and serious bleeding. In August 2007, the FDA label for warfarin was updated to highlight the benefit of genetic testing to predict warfarin response.
