Prospective <i>CYP2C19</i> Genotyping to Guide Antiplatelet Therapy Following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A Pragmatic Randomized Clinical Trial.
<i>CYP2C19</i> loss-of-function alleles impair clopidogrel effectiveness after percutaneous coronary intervention, but the clinical impact of implementing <i>CYP2C19</i> genotyping in a real-world setting is unknown. The purpose of the study was to determine whether returning <i>CYP2C19</i> genotype results along with genotype-guided pharmacotherapy recommendations using a rapid turnaround test would change antiplatelet prescribing following percutaneous coronary intervention.The primary outcome was the rate of prasugrel or ticagrelor prescribing in each arm. Secondary outcomes included agreement to the genotype-guided recommendations.
