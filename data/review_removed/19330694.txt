Development of a therapeutics curriculum to enhance knowledge of fourth-year medical students about clinical uses and adverse effects of drugs.
Enhanced clinical pharmacology and therapeutics education of medical students is important for improving effective and safe drug therapy. Increased education about pharmacovigilance is needed because serious drug-induced adverse effects are increasing. Fostering the needed scientific approach to prescribing requires knowledge of evidence-based drug therapy, based on understanding clinical trials. Therapeutic agents with novel mechanisms of action are increasingly available, and an unbiased understanding of the risks and benefits of novel agents is also important. These issues can be addressed in clinical pharmacology courses. However, many medical schools lack sufficient clinical pharmacologists to teach such courses. The Southern Illinois University Medical School faculty implemented an Advanced Therapeutics course to address these issues.
