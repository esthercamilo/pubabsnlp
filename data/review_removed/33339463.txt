Multi-factorial pharmacokinetic interactions: unraveling complexities in precision drug therapy.
<b>Introduction:</b> Precision drug therapy requires accounting for pertinent factors in pharmacokinetic (PK) inter-individual variability (<i>i.e</i>., pharmacogenetics, diseases, polypharmacy, and natural product use) that can cause sub-therapeutic or adverse effects. Although each of these individual factors can alter victim drug PK, multi-factorial interactions can cause additive, synergistic, or opposing effects. Determining the magnitude and direction of these complex multi-factorial effects requires understanding the rate-limiting redundant and/or sequential PK processes for each drug.<b>Areas covered:</b> Perturbations in drug-metabolizing enzymes and/or transporters are integral to single- and multi-factorial PK interactions. Examples of single factor PK interactions presented include gene-drug (pharmacogenetic), disease-drug, drug-drug, and natural product-drug interactions. Examples of multi-factorial PK interactions presented include drug-gene-drug, natural product-gene-drug, gene-gene-drug, disease-natural product-drug, and disease-gene-drug interactions. Clear interpretation of multi-factorial interactions can be complicated by study design, complexity in victim drug PK, and incomplete mechanistic understanding of victim drug PK.<b>Expert opinion:</b> Incorporation of complex multi-factorial PK interactions into precision drug therapy requires advances in clinical decision tools, intentional PK study designs, drug-metabolizing enzyme and transporter fractional contribution determinations, systems and computational approaches (<i>e.g</i>., physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling), and PK phenotyping of progressive diseases.
