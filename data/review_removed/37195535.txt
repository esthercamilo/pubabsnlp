An Overview of Organ-on-a-Chip Models for Recapitulating Human Pulmonary Vascular Diseases.
Traditionally, animal models have been used for recapitulating human physiology and for studying the pathological basis of many diseases affecting humankind. Indeed, over the centuries, animal models helped advance our understanding of the biology and pathology of drug therapy for humans. However, with the advent of genomics and pharmacogenomics, we now know that conventional models cannot accurately capture the pathological conditions and biological processes in humans, although humans share many physiological and anatomical features with many animals [1-3]. Species to species variation have raised concerns about the validity and suitability of animal models for studying human conditions. Over the past decade, the development and advances in microfabrication and biomaterials have spurred the growth in micro-engineered tissue and organ models (organs-on-a-chip, OoC) as alternatives to animal and cellular models [4]. This state-of-the-art technology has been used to emulate human physiology for investigating multitudes of cellular and biomolecular processes implicated in the pathological basis of disease (Fig. 13.1) [4]. Because of their tremendous potential, OoC-based models have been listed as one of the top 10 emerging technologies in the 2016 World Economic Forum [2].
