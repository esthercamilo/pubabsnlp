Prevalence of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 variants and the impact on clopidogrel efficacy in patients having CYPC19*2 variant.
Human cytochrome p450 enzymes play an important role in the metabolism of various substances. The CYP2C subfamily consists of various important drug-metabolizing enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The objectives of the study include the determination of the frequency of genetic variants (CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and CYP2C19*2) of selected enzymes using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR) and its comparison with Indian as well as global past frequencies. We also aimed to study the impact of genetic mutation on clopidogrel efficacy and compare the efficacies between patients with and without CYP2C19*2 genetic variant.
