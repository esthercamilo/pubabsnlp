Evaluation of clinical impact of pharmacogenomics knowledge involved in CPIC guidelines on Chinese pediatric patients.
<b>Aim:</b> To evaluate the clinical benefits of implementing pharmacogenomics testing for Chinese pediatric patients. <b>Materials &</b> <b>methods :</b> Based on the drug-gene interactions involved in the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines, whole-genome sequencing data from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Precision Medicine Initiative project and the medication data of pediatric patients from a children's hospital, the prevalence of the Chinese population with actionable pharmacogenomic variants was calculated, the prescribing pattern for pediatric patients was analyzed. <b>Results:</b> 37.0% of the drugs involved in the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines were used by Chinese pediatric patients, 8.91% inpatients and 0.89% outpatients received at least one pharmacogenomics medication, 1.24% (4803) inpatients and 0.16% (2940) outpatients were estimated to be at high risk of pharmacogenomic-related adverse therapeutic outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Implementing pharmacogenomics testing can improve therapeutic outcomes for many Chinese pediatric patients.
