Clinical response of carboplatin-based chemotherapy and its association to genetic polymorphism in lung cancer patients from North India - A clinical pharmacogenomics study.
Lung cancer mostly diagnosed at advanced inoperable stages; thereby, the chemo-, radiation-, targeted or immune-therapy alone or in combination remains the treatment of choice. In chemotherapy, platinum-based compounds such as cisplatin and carboplatin and third-generation drugs such as docetaxel, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine are widely used. The beneficial therapeutic outcome of the chemotherapy alone or in combination with radiation (chemoradiation) and/or development of drug resistance depends on the inter-individual genetic differences. Hence, this study was carried out to find gene biomarker that could be useful in the diagnosis of the disease and to predict the outcome of chemo/chemoradiation therapy in ethnic North Indian population.
