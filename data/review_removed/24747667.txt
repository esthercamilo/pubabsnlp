Codeine-related deaths: The role of pharmacogenetics and drug interactions.
The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and drug interactions on codeine and morphine concentrations in codeine-related deaths (CRD). All CRD in Ontario, Canada between 2006 and 2008 were identified. Post-mortem blood was analyzed for 22 polymorphisms in 5 genes involved in codeine metabolism and response. Sixty-eight CRD were included in this study. The morphine-to-codeine ratio was significantly correlated with the presence of a CYP2D6 inhibitor at varying potencies (p=0.0011). The presence of other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (i.e. benzodiazepines, hypnotics, and/or alcohol) was significantly associated with lower codeine concentration as compared to CRD in which other CNS depressants were not detected (p=0.0002). Individuals who carried the ABCB1 1236T variant had significantly lower morphine concentrations (p=0.004). In this population of individuals whose cause of death was related to codeine, drug interactions and genetic polymorphisms were significantly associated with post-mortem codeine and morphine concentrations.
