A Nanopore sequencing-based pharmacogenomic panel to personalize tuberculosis drug dosing.
Standardized dosing of anti-tubercular (TB) drugs leads to variable plasma drug levels, which are associated with adverse drug reactions, delayed treatment response, and relapse. Mutations in genes affecting drug metabolism explain considerable interindividual pharmacokinetic variability; however, pharmacogenomic (PGx) assays that predict metabolism of anti-TB drugs have been lacking.
