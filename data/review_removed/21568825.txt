Pharmacogenomics and adverse drug reactions: the case of statins.
The use of genomics to predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has been the subject of much research over the last decade. Concerns about the muscular safety of statins, a highly prescribed group of drugs, are partially related to their high exposure. Many studies have identified a variety of genetic markers related to statin-induced myopathy. However, only polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 gene (which encodes the carrier responsible for the hepatic uptake of statins, which, in turn, contributes to the regulation of plasma levels of SLCO1B1) were strongly associated with statin-induced muscular adverse effects. These was found to be most prominent for simvastatin. The strength of these findings relies on the use of modern genetic approaches, such as well-designed, case-controlled and genome-wide association studies. Nevertheless, the clinical use of this information is far from known at present and needs to be evaluated.
