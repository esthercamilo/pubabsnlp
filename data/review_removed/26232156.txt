A clinical approach to solving discrepancies in therapeutic drug monitoring results for patients on sirolimus or tacrolimus: Towards personalized medicine, immunosuppression and pharmacogenomics.
Unexpected clinical laboratory concentrations often need to be investigated before they are acted upon in a clinical setting. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) frequently involves drugs with narrow therapeutic windows and can be harmful to the patient if changes are made based on erroneous serum drug concentrations. Too little of the drug will result in ineffective therapy and too much of the drug can cause life threatening toxicities. There are many factors that can result in unexpected serum drug concentrations including differences in analytical methods being used, diet, timing of blood draw, genotype and compliance. All these factors should all be considered before deciding if changes should be made in a patient's therapeutic course.
