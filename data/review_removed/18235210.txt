Pharmacogenomics.
The term 'pharmacogenomics' refers to the general study of all of the different genes that determine drug behavior. In research, our aim, in this regard, is to gain an understanding of how genetic variation present among individuals contributes to differences in reactions to drugs. This issue of 'Pancreatology and the Web' focuses on some educational websites on pharmacogenomics, which is an exciting field of biomedical research. This field has the potential to significantly impact on the way the MD prescribes medicines to patients in the future, improving upon the quality of care that we can provide. and IAP.
