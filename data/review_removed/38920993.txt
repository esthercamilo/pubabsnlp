Association of Glycoprotein IIIa PlA1/A2 Polymorphism with Risk of Stroke: Updated Meta-Analysis.
Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death in the world, with ischemic heart disease (i.e., myocardial infarction) and cerebrovascular disease (i.e., stroke) taking the highest toll. Advances in diagnosis and treatment have led to a significant alleviation of ischemic complications, specifically in the realm of pharmacotherapy and interventional devices, while pharmacogenomics has yet to be fully leveraged to improve the burden of disease. Atherothrombotic events might occur earlier or respond worse to treatment in patients with genetic variants of GP IIb/IIIa. Therefore, we aimed to quantitate the involvement of the PlA2 variant in the risk of cerebral stroke events. A systematic search and meta-analysis were performed by pooling the risks of individual studies. A total of 31 studies comprising 5985 stroke patients and 7886 controls were analyzed. A meta-analysis of four studies on hemorrhagic stroke patients showed no association with the PIA2 rs5918(C) polymorphism in both fixed-effect (OR = 0.90 95%CI [0.71; 1.14]; <i>p</i> = 0.398) and random-effect models (OR = 0.86 95%CI [0.62; 1.20]; <i>p</i>-value = 0.386). The power of this analysis was below <30%, indicating a limited ability to detect a true effect. An analysis of the 28 studies on ischemic stroke revealed a significant association with the PIA2 rs5918(C) allele in both fixed-effect (OR = 1.16 95%CI [1.06; 1.27]; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and random-effect models (OR = 1.20 95%CI [1.04; 1.38]; <i>p</i>-value = 0.012), with a power of >80%. The PIA2 allele was associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. No association was found with hemorrhagic stroke, most likely due to the small number of available studies, which resulted in a lack of power.
