[Atherosclerosis: a complex disease].
Atherosclerosis is a complex disease resulting from an interaction between environmental risk factors (diet, smoking habit, lack of exercise, stress) and a favourable genetic profile. In the recent past, the analysis of the genetic factors involved has considerably progressed. A significant number of genetic variants associated with the various phenotypes of atherosclerosis or its risk factors have been identified. Each, taken individually, only exerts a modest influence, but as a group, they play a significant role, albeit as yet not precisely quantified, in the aetiology of atherosclerosis. The individual response to various therapies prescribed in atherosclerosis can also be significantly influenced by genetic factors. In the next future, genetics and pharmacogenetics will represent major determinants of our approach to the prevention and individualized treatment of atherosclerosis and its complications.
