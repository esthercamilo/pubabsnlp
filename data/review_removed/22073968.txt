The paradigm of personalized therapy in oncology.
Currently, anticancer therapy is mainly based on histology and on giving the same treatment to presumed homogeneous patients. The switch from histology-driven therapy to molecular clinical oncology is correlated with a better understanding of the 'molecular taxonomy' of each tumor that can provide us with targets for specific drugs. Cancer therapy is moving irreversibly towards personalized therapy that benefits selected patients. Once the potential therapeutic targets are identified, the availability of predictive biomarkers is the key element and their prospective evaluation should be a parallel component of the clinical evaluation of a new drug.
