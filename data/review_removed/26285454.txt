[THE TREATMENT OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MUST BE TAILOR-MADE].
Hypertension has a high world-wide prevalence, affecting more than 25 % of the population; it remains the silent killer number one in cardiovascular pathology. Although lowering high blood pressure is protective, perfect control of hypertension is far from being optimal in spite of many international guidelines regularly updated according to published scientific studies. A personalized approach of hypertension management is an attractive way to improve this situation. Tools are developing (pharmacogenetics, pharmacometabolomics), but their use in daily clinical practice seems premature. At the present time, it is the physician experience which offers the best opportunity to propose the best treatment to the best patient. The management of hypertension remains a difficult task in some cases. Patient education is also crucial to improve drug compliance.
