Genetic and nongenetic factors influencing pharmacokinetics of B-type natriuretic peptide.
Natriuretic peptides (NPs) represent a critical pathway in heart failure (HF). However, there is wide individual variability in NP system activity, which could be partly genetic in origin. We explored genetic and nongenetic contributions to B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) inactivation.
