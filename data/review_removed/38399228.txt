The Status Quo of Pharmacogenomics of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Precision Oncology: A Bibliometric Analysis of the Literature.
Precision oncology and pharmacogenomics (PGx) intersect in their overarching goal to institute the right treatment for the right patient. However, the translation of these innovations into clinical practice is still lagging behind. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the current state of research and to predict the future directions of applied PGx in the field of precision oncology as represented by the targeted therapy class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Advanced bibliometric and scientometric analyses of the literature were performed. The Scopus database was used for the search, and articles published between 2001 and 2023 were extracted. Information about productivity, citations, cluster analysis, keyword co-occurrence, trend topics, and thematic evolution were generated. A total of 448 research articles were included in this analysis. A burst of scholarly activity in the field was noted by the year 2005, peaking in 2017, followed by a remarkable decline to date. Research in the field was hallmarked by consistent and impactful international collaboration, with the US leading in terms of most prolific country, institutions, and total link strength. Thematic evolution in the field points in the direction of more specialized studies on applied pharmacokinetics of available and novel TKIs, particularly for the treatment of lung and breast cancers. Our results delineate a significant advancement in the field of PGx in precision oncology. Notwithstanding the practical challenges to these applications at the point of care, further research, standardization, infrastructure development, and informed policymaking are urgently needed to ensure widespread adoption of PGx.
