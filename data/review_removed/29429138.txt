QTc prolongation in short-term treatment of schizophrenia patients: effects of different antipsychotics and genetic factors.
Antipsychotics are effective in treating schizophrenia but may lead to a higher cardiovascular risk due to QTc prolongation. Besides drugs, genetic and clinical factors may contribute to QTc prolongation. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of candidate genes known for QTc prolongation and their interaction with common antipsychotics. Thus, 199 patients were genotyped for nine polymorphisms in KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, LOC10537879, LOC101927066, NOS1AP and NUBPL. QTc interval duration was measured before treatment and weekly for 5Â weeks while being treated with risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, amisulpride, aripiprazole and haloperidol in monotherapy. Antipsychotics used in this study showed a different potential to affect the QTc interval. We found no association between KCNH2, KCNQ1, LOC10537879, LOC101927066, NOS1AP and NUBPL polymorphisms and QTc duration at baseline and during antipsychotic treatment. Mixed general models showed a significant overall influence of SCN5A (H558R) on QTc duration but no significant interaction with antipsychotic treatment. Our results do not provide evidence for an involvement of candidate genes for QTc duration in the pathophysiology of QTc prolongation by antipsychotics during short-term treatment. Further association studies are needed to confirm our findings. With a better understanding of these interactions the cardiovascular risk of patients may be decreased.
