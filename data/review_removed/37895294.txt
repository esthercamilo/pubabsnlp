<i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i> Variant Coverage of Commercial Antidepressant Pharmacogenomic Testing Panels Available in Victoria, Australia.
Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing to inform antidepressant medication selection and dosing is gaining attention from healthcare professionals, patients, and payors in Australia. However, there is often uncertainty regarding which test is most suitable for a particular patient. Here, we identified and evaluated the coverage of <i>CYP2D6</i> and <i>CYP2C19</i> variants in commercial antidepressant PGx testing panels in Victoria, a large and ethnically diverse state of Australia. Test characteristics and star alleles tested for both genes were obtained directly from pathology laboratories offering PGx testing and compared against the Association of Molecular Pathology's recommended minimum (Tier 1) and extended (Tier 2) allele sets. Although all tests covered the minimum recommended alleles for <i>CYP2C19</i>, this was not the case for <i>CYP2D6</i>. This study emphasizes that PGx tests might not be suitable for all individuals in Australia due to the limited range of star alleles assessed. Inadequate haplotype coverage may risk misclassification of an individual's predicted metabolizer phenotype, which has ramifications for depression medication selection and dosage. This study underscores the urgent need for greater standardization in PGx testing and emphasizes the importance of considering genetic ancestry when choosing a PGx testing panel to ensure optimal clinical applicability.
