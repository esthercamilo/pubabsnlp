Rapid Naked-Eye Discrimination of Cytochrome P450 Genetic Polymorphism through Non-Crosslinking Aggregation of DNA-Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles.
Involvement of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping in healthcare should allow for more effective use of pharmacogenomics. However, user-friendly assays without the requirement of a special instrument still remain unavailable. This study describes naked-eye SNP discrimination in exon 5 of the human cytochrome P450 2C19 monooxygenase gene, <i>CYP2C19*1</i> (the wild-type allele) and <i>CYP2C19*2</i> (the variant allele with G681A point mutation). The present assay is composed of allele-specific single-base primer extension and salt-induced aggregation of DNA-modified gold nanoparticles (DNA-AuNPs). Genetic samples extracted from human hair roots are subjected to this assay. The results are verified by direct sequencing. This study should promise the prospective use of DNA-AuNPs in gene diagnosis.
