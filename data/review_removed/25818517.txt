Population pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients: consideration of genetic polymorphisms.
Cyclosporine (CsA), which is used for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT), has a narrow therapeutic range and large interindividual and intraindividual pharmacokinetic variability. Nevertheless, population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) studies of CsA in allo-HSCT are scarce.
