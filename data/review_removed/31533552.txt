Feasibility of Integrating Panel-Based Pharmacogenomics Testing for Chemotherapy and Supportive Care in Patients With Colorectal Cancer.
Pharmacogenomics is about selecting the "right drug in the right amount for the right patient." In metastatic colorectal cancer, germline pharmacogenomics testing presents a unique opportunity to improve outcomes, since the genes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase metabolizing the chemotherapy drugs, 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan are already well known. In a retrospective analysis of the landmark TRIBE clinical trial [(TRIBE - TRIplet plus BEvacizumab multicenter, phase III trial by the Italian Cooperative GONO (Gruppo Oncologico Nord Ovest) group (NCT00719797)], the proportion of patients with serious adverse events was higher in those with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase/UDP-glucuronosyltransferase aberrations and was dose dependent. We aimed to report on the feasibility and the results of incorporating pharmacogenomics testing into clinical practice.
