OCT1 genetic variants are associated with postoperative morphine-related adverse effects in children.
Large interindividual variability in morphine pharmacokinetics (PK) could contribute to variability in morphine analgesia and adverse events. Respiratory depression (RD) and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are significant adverse drug response of intravenous morphine in the perioperative setting limiting its efficacy in achieving adequate surgical pain relief. OCT1 is a transporter in the liver that transports morphine from the bloodstream into hepatocytes. Earlier we reported association of genetic polymorphisms in OCT1 with morphine PK, and lower morphine clearance in Caucasian children as compared with African-American (AA) children. The aim of this study is to identify the association between common OCT1 genotypes affecting morphine's PK and clinically important postoperative morphine-related adverse outcomes.
