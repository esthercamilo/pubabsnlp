The Role of Pharmacogenomics in Postoperative Pain Management.
Pharmacogenomics can improve pain management by considering individual variations in pain perception and susceptibility and sensitivity to medicines related to genetic diversity. Due to the subjective nature of pain and the fact that people respond differently to medicines, it can be challenging to develop a consistent and successful regimen for pain disorders. Numerous factors influence the outcome of pain treatment programs, but two stand out: altered perception of pain and varying responsiveness to analgesic medicines. Numerous polymorphisms in genes such as CYP2D6, OPRM1, and ABCB1 have been identified, culminating in a heterogeneous response to pain medication in people who have these genetic polymorphisms. Improved treatment regimens that factor in pharmacogenetic differences in patients would help reduce the risk of opioid dependency and help effectively treat postoperative pain.
