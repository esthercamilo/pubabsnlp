Candidate Genes for Prediction of Efficacy and Safety of Statin Therapy in the Kazakh Population.
The purpose of this research was to determine the frequency of mutation of the cytochrome <i>CYP3A5</i> genes and transport proteins SLCO1B1 and MDR1 in patients with coronary heart disease in the Kazakh nation. A prospective cohort clinical and genetic study was conducted. The study was conducted in 2017-2019. Medical records containing information about drug prescription conducted in hospitals and outpatient departments were carefully analyzed. In the examined group of 178 patients treated with statins, a significant frequency of genetic variants that determine the increased risk of complications of statin use was revealed. There was a tendency toward an increase in the activity of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in the blood upon detection of the A6986G mutation of the cytochrome gene and <i>SLCO1B1</i> (c.521T>C) gene of the transport protein OATP1B1. In the studied Kazakh population, the presence of a homozygous mutant <i>SLCO1B1</i> gene of the transport protein can be recommended as a genetic marker for the undesirability of using antihypercholesterolemic therapy with statins, which simultaneously leads to a decrease in the effectiveness of treatment and an increase in the risk of side effects.
