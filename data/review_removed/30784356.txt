Drug-gene and drug-drug interactions associated with tramadol and codeine therapy in the INGENIOUS trial.
<b>Background:</b> Tramadol and codeine are metabolized by CYP2D6 and are subject to drug-gene and drug-drug interactions. <b>Methods:</b> This interim analysis examined prescribing behavior and efficacy in 102 individuals prescribed tramadol or codeine while receiving pharmaco-genotyping as part of the INGENIOUS trial (NCT02297126). <b>Results:</b> Within 60 days of receiving tramadol or codeine, clinicians more frequently prescribed an alternative opioid in ultrarapid and poor metabolizers (odds ratio: 19.0; 95% CI: 2.8-160.4) as compared with normal or indeterminate metabolizers (p = 0.01). After adjusting the CYP2D6 activity score for drug-drug interactions, uncontrolled pain was reported more frequently in individuals with reduced CYP2D6 activity (odds ratio: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.25-0.94). <b>Conclusion:</b> Phenoconversion for drug-drug and drug-gene interactions is an important consideration in pharmacogenomic implementation; drug-drug interactions may obscure the potential benefits of genotyping.
