Pharmacogenetics in obstetric anesthesia.
Genomic research in pain, anesthesia and analgesia generated some hope that pharmacogenetics may guide anesthesiologists to provide effective medicine in a 'tailored' manner. Within the field of obstetric anesthesia, relatively few studies have evaluated the effect of polymorphisms on the perception of labor or postcesarean pain or the response to analgesics for childbirth. Because of the multifactorial nature of labor and delivery pain and particularly challenging clinical context, many consider that 'titration of drugs to the desired effect works just fine'. With recent evidence highlighting an association between severe postdelivery pain and persistent pain, early recognition of an increased susceptibility for acute pain has become particularly relevant.
