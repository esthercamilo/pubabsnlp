Dolutegravir Discontinuation for Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in People Living with HIV and Their Outcomes after Treatment Change: A Pharmacogenetic Study.
Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients receiving dolutegravir, a known inhibitor of the renal and neuronal-expressed organic anion transporter 2 (encoded by SLC22A2 gene). The effect of the genetic variant SLC22A2 808C>A on dolutegravir discontinuation was assessed and analyzed by real-time PCR. We enrolled 627 participants: CA/AA carriers showed a higher prevalence of pre-existing psychiatric comorbidities and use of antidepressants. After 27.9 months, 108 participants discontinued dolutegravir, 64 for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Patients with pre-existing psychiatric comorbidities were at higher risk of dolutegravir discontinuation, while patients carrying the SLC22A2 CA/AA genotype were not. Combining the two variables, an opposite effect of SLC22A2 variants according to pre-existing psychiatric disorders was observed. Using multivariate Cox models, the combined variable pre-existing psychiatric comorbidities/SLC22A2 variants and the use of non-tenofovir alafenamide containing antiretroviral regimens were predictors of dolutegravir discontinuation for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Within 30 days, the majority of participants had a complete resolution of symptoms (61.8%), while 32.7% and 5.5% had partial or no change after dolutegravir discontinuation, respectively. Discontinuation of dolutegravir for neuropsychiatric symptoms was not uncommon and more frequent in participants with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. We described an interaction between SLC22A2 genetic variant and psychiatric comorbidities. In 38.2% of patients, a complete neuropsychiatric symptoms resolution was not observed after dolutegravir discontinuation suggesting the involvement of additional factors.
