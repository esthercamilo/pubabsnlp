RNA tape sampling in cutaneous lupus erythematosus discriminates affected from unaffected and healthy volunteer skin.
Punch biopsy, a standard diagnostic procedure for patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) carries an infection risk, is invasive, uncomfortable and potentially scarring, and impedes patient recruitment in clinical trials. Non-invasive tape sampling is an alternative that could enable serial evaluation of specific lesions. This cross-sectional pilot research study evaluated the use of a non-invasive adhesive tape device to collect messenger RNA (mRNA) from the skin surface of participants with CLE and healthy volunteers (HVs) and investigated its feasibility to detect biologically meaningful differences between samples collected from participants with CLE and samples from HVs.
