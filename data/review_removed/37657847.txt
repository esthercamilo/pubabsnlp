Evaluating the prospective utility of pharmacogenetics reporting among Canadian Armed Forces personnel receiving pharmacotherapy: a preliminary assessment towards precision psychiatric care.
Pharmacological interventions for treating posttraumatic stress disorder in Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members and Veterans often achieve modest results. The field of pharmacogenetics, or the study of how genes influence an individual's response to different medications, offers insight into how prior knowledge of gene-drug interactions may potentially improve the trial-and-error process of drug selection in pharmacotherapy, thereby improving treatment effects and remission rates. Given the relative recency of pharmacogenetics testing and sparse research in military samples, we used pharmacogenetics testing in a small pilot group (n=23) of CAF members and Veterans who were already engaged in pharmacotherapy for a service-related mental health condition to better understand the associated opportunities and challenges of pharmacogenetics testing in this population. Our preliminary evaluation involved: (1) reporting the prevalence of pharmacogenetics testing 'bin' status according to participants' reports ('green', 'yellow' or 'red'; intending to signal 'go', 'caution' or 'stop', regarding the potential for gene-drug interactions); (2) calculating the percentage of currently prescribed psychotropic medications that were assessed and included in the reports; (3) evaluating whether prescribers used pharmacogenetics testing information according to clinical notes and (4) collecting informal feedback from participating psychiatrists. While pharmacogenetics testing appeared to provide valuable information for a number of clients, a major limitation was the number of commonly prescribed medications not included in the reports.
