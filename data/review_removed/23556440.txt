Lymphoblastoid cell lines in pharmacogenomics: how applicable are they to clinical outcomes?
LCLs are widely used in pharmacogenomic studies and the applicability of LCLs for various clinical phenotypes is emerging. Early studies have yielded promising results for LCLs as a proxy for genetic variants for treatment outcome for a number of cancers as well as toxicity in varying tissue types including taxane-induced neuropathy. Although LCLs have demonstrated utility in the elucidation of functional mechanisms for results of clinical genotype-drug phenotype studies, there are more relevant cell-based models developing.
