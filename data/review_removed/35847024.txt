A Computational Framework to Characterize the Cancer Drug Induced Effect on Aging Using Transcriptomic Data.
Cancer treatments such as chemotherapies may change or accelerate aging trajectories in cancer patients. Emerging evidence has shown that "omics" data can be used to study molecular changes of the aging process. Here, we integrated the drug-induced and normal aging transcriptomic data to computationally characterize the potential cancer drug-induced aging process in patients. Our analyses demonstrated that the aging-associated gene expression in the GTEx dataset can recapitulate the well-established aging hallmarks. We next characterized the drug-induced transcriptomic changes of 28 FDA approved cancer drugs in brain, kidney, muscle, and adipose tissues. Further drug-aging interaction analysis identified 34 potential drug regulated aging events. Those events include aging accelerating effects of vandetanib (Caprelsa®) and dasatinib (Sprycel®) in brain and muscle, respectively. Our result also demonstrated aging protective effect of vorinostat (Zolinza®), everolimus (Afinitor®), and bosutinib (Bosulif®) in brain.
