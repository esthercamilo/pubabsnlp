A pharmacogenetics study of the human glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A4.
UGT1A4 is primarily expressed in the liver and exhibits catalytic activities for various drugs. Amongst the few UGT1A4 polymorphisms evaluated, studies support the alteration of UGT1A4-mediated glucuronidation by a few variations including the Pro²⁴Thr and Leu⁴⁸Val variants (referred to as UGT1A4*2 and *3).
