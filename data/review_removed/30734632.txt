Association between <i>SLCO1B1</i> rs4149056 and tegafur-uracil-induced hepatic dysfunction in breast cancer.
<b>Aim:</b> The aim of this study was to identify pharmacogenomic biomarkers to predict tegafur-uracil (UFT)-induced liver dysfunction. <b>Patients & methods:</b> A total of 68 patients, who were administered UFT, were evaluated using a two-step pharmacogenomics analysis. <b>Results:</b> The first screening revealed the association between five SNPs and UFT-induced hepatic dysfunction. In the second step, <i>SLCO1B1</i> (rs4149056) was found to be the only SNP associated with UFT treatment-related elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (odds ratio: C/C vs T/T = 7.8, C/T vs T/T = 5.7; p = 0.037) and alanine transaminase (odds ratio: C/C vs T/T = 12.2, C/T vs T/T = 4.1; p = 0.034) levels. <b>Conclusion:</b> The <i>SLCO1B1</i> polymorphisms are possible predictors of UFT treatment-related hepatic dysfunction.
