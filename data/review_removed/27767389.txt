Correlation of SIN3A genomic variants with β-hemoglobinopathies disease severity and hydroxyurea treatment efficacy.
Hemoglobinopathies, particularly β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, are characterized by great phenotypic variability in terms of disease severity, while notable differences have been observed in hydroxyurea treatment efficacy. In both cases, the observed phenotypic diversity is mostly dependent on the elevated fetal hemoglobin levels, resulting from the persistent fetal globin gene expression in the adult erythroid stage orchestrated by intricate mechanisms that still remain only partly understood. We have previously shown that several protein factors act as modifiers of fetal hemoglobin production, exerting their effect via different pathways.
