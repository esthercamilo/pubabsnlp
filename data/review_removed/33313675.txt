Computational drug repositioning based on the relationships between substructure-indication.
At present, computational methods for drug repositioning are mainly based on the whole structures of drugs, which limits the discovery of new functions due to the similarities between local structures of drugs. In this article, we, for the first time, integrated the features of chemical-genomics (substructure-domain) and pharmaco-genomics (domain-indication) based on the assumption that drug-target interactions are mediated by the substructures of drugs and the domains of proteins to identify the relationships between substructure-indication and establish a drug-substructure-indication network for predicting all therapeutic effects of tested drugs through only information on the substructures of drugs. In total, 83 205 drug-indication relationships with different correlation scores were obtained. We used three different verification methods to indicate the accuracy of the method and the reliability of the scoring system. We predicted all indications of olaparib using our method, including the known antitumor effect and unknown antiviral effect verified by literature, and we also discovered the inhibitory mechanism of olaparib toward DNA repair through its specific sub494 (o = C-C: C), as it participates in the low synthesis of the poly subfunction of the apoptosis pathway (hsa04210) by inhibiting the Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor(s) (ITPRs) and hydrolyzing poly (ADP ribose) polymerases. ElectroCardioGrams of four drugs (quinidine, amiodarone, milrinone and fosinopril) demonstrated the effect of anti-arrhythmia. Unlike previous studies focusing on the overall structures of drugs, our research has great potential in the search for more therapeutic effects of drugs and in predicting all potential effects and mechanisms of a drug from the local structural similarity.
