Efficacy of Warfarin Therapy Guided by Pharmacogenetics: A Real-world Investigation Among Han Taiwanese.
The anticoagulation activity of warfarin in populations with CYP2C9, VKORC1, and CYP4F2 variants differs between individuals and is correlated with poor international normalized ratio (INR) control. Pharmacogenetics-guided warfarin dosing has been successfully developed for patients with genetic variations in recent years. However, few real-world data have been used to investigate the INR and warfarin dosage and the time to target INR. This study examined the largest collection of genetic and clinical real-world data related to warfarin to provide further evidence supporting the benefits of pharmacogenetics in clinical outcomes.
