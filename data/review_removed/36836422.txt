Tumor Microenvironment and Genes Affecting the Prognosis of Temozolomide-Treated Glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent primary brain tumor in adults and has a poor prognosis due to its resistance to Temozolomide (TMZ). However, there is limited research regarding the tumor microenvironment and genes related to the prognosis of TMZ-treated GBM patients. This study aimed to identify putative transcriptomic biomarkers with predictive value in patients with GBM who were treated with TMZ. Publicly available datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus were analyzed using CIBERSORTx and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to obtain types of highly expressed cell types and gene clusters. Differentially Expressed Genes analysis was performed and was intersected with the WGCNA results to obtain a candidate gene list. Cox proportional-hazard survival analysis was performed to acquire genes related to the prognosis of TMZ-treated GBM patients. Inflammatory microglial cells, dendritic cells, myeloid cells, and glioma stem cells were highly expressed in GBM tissue, and <i>ACP7</i>, <i>EPPK1</i>, <i>PCDHA8</i>, <i>RHOD</i>, <i>DRC1</i>, <i>ZIC3</i>, and <i>PRLR</i> were significantly associated with survival. While the listed genes have been previously reported to be related to glioblastoma or other types of cancer, <i>ACP7</i> was identified as a novel gene related to the prognosis of GBM. These findings may have potential implications for developing a diagnostic tool to predict GBM resistance and optimize treatment decisions.
