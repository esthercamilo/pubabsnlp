The Implementation of Pharmacogenetics in the United Kingdom.
There is considerable inter-individual variability in the effectiveness and safety of pharmaceutical interventions. This phenomenon can be attributed to a multitude of factors; however, it is widely acknowledged that common genetic variation affecting drug absorption or metabolism play a substantial contributory role. This is a concept known as pharmacogenetics. Understanding how common genetic variants influence responses to medications, and using this knowledge to inform prescribing practice, could yield significant advantages for both patients and healthcare systems. Some health services around the world have introduced pharmacogenetics into routine practice, whereas others are less advanced along the implementation pathway. This chapter introduces the field of pharmacogenetics, the existing body of evidence, and discusses barriers to implementation. The chapter will specifically focus on efforts to introduce pharmacogenetics in the NHS, highlighting key challenges related to scale, informatics, and education.
