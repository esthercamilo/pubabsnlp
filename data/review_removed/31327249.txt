[Tacrolimus therapy after renal transplantation. <i>Current questions of concentration/dose ratio</i>].
Tacrolimus is an important part of immunosuppressive therapy after solid organ transplantation. The therapeutic range of the drug from the calcineurin inhibitor group is narrow. Adjustment of the blood concentration can be very complicated but to be able to avoid the occurrence of side effects or ineffective immunosuppression it is inevitable. This article summarizes the properties of tacrolimus pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics. We will focus on individual variations of cytochrome enzymes. In the following part, a new method for screening high risk patients will be introduced. We will present the publications of the determination of the concentration/dose (C/D) ratio. By determining the C/D ratio, researchers identify fast and slow metabolizing patient groups. Fast metabolizers require higher doses in general and the occurrence of complications is also more frequent in this group. Long-term results are lagging behind the slow metabolizing group. The long-term results of renal transplantation nowadays contribute to the postoperative period and the later years rather than the surgery itself. It includes the proper management of previous illnesses (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, endocrinological problems), detection of complications (e.g., infections, malignancies), and the precise regulation of immunosuppressive therapy.
