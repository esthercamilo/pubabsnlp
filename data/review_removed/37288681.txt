Advancing Pharmacogenomics-Based Care Through Interprofessional Education.
As genomic medicine becomes increasingly complex, pharmacists need to work collaboratively with other healthcare professionals to provide genomics-based care. The core pharmacist competencies in genomics were recently updated and mapped to the entrustable professional activities (EPAs). The new competency that is mapped to the "Interprofessional Team Member" EPA domain emphasizes the role of pharmacists as the pharmacogenomics experts in an interprofessional healthcare team. Interprofessional education (IPE) activities involving student pharmacists and students from other healthcare disciplines are crucial to prepare student pharmacists for a team-based approach to patient-centered care. This commentary discusses the pharmacogenomics-focused IPE activities implemented by 3 programs, the challenges faced, and the lessons learned. It also discusses strategies to develop pharmacogenomics-focused IPE activities based on existing resources. Developing pharmacogenomics-focused IPE activities will help prepare pharmacy graduates with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to lead collaborative, interprofessional teams in the provision of pharmacogenomics-based care, consistent with the standards described in the genomics competencies for pharmacists.
