Immune outcomes of lung transplant recipients with different cytochrome P450 3A5 phenotypes after discontinuation of voriconazole antifungal prophylaxis.
Tacrolimus forms the backbone of immunosuppression regimens in lung transplant recipients (LTRs). It is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 enzymes, of which polymorphisms can significantly affect tacrolimus dose requirements. It is unknown how coadministration of tacrolimus with voriconazole, a potent CYP3A5 inhibitor, affects rejection rates or empiric dose adjustments needed after voriconazole discontinuation.
