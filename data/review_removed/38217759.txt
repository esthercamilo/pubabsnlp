Genetic polymorphisms as potential pharmacogenetic biomarkers for platinum-based chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.
Platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) is a widely used treatment for various solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its efficacy is often compromised by the emergence of drug resistance in patients. There is growing evidence that genetic variations may influence the susceptibility of NSCLC patients to develop resistance to PBC. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying platinum drug resistance and highlight the important role that genetic polymorphisms play in this process. This paper discussed the genetic variants that regulate DNA repair, cellular movement, drug transport, metabolic processing, and immune response, with a focus on their effects on response to PBC. The potential applications of these genetic polymorphisms as predictive indicators in clinical practice are explored, as are the challenges associated with their implementation.
