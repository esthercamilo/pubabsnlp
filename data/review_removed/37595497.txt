The effect of genetic variation in estrogen transportation and metabolism on the severity of menopause symptoms: A study from the RIGHT 10K cohort.
The severity of menopause-related symptoms varies considerably among women. The determinants of this variation are incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to assess the association between genetic variation in estrogen metabolism and transport pathways and the severity of menopause symptoms.
