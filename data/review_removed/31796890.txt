Opportunities for pharmacists to integrate pharmacogenomics into clinical practice.
Many medical centers in the United States have implemented pharmacogenomics (PGx) programs to integrate PGx into clinical practice. The roles of pharmacists in optimizing medication use based on genetic testing results are emergently evolving. A literature search was conducted to assess pharmacists' roles in pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics or precision/personalized medicine programs. Fifteen PGx pharmacy practice models implemented in eleven hospitals and one community pharmacy in the U.S. were selected for evaluation. Pharmacists perform results interpretation, genotype-guided medication selection and adjustment, medication acquisition, adverse reactions monitoring, and patient education. Institutions that are interested in implementing a PGx program should plan the strategies to overcome the challenges, such as educational knowledge gaps, informatics, and reimbursement issues. Strong institutional support, well-defined goals, standardized procedures, and strategies to educate clinicians and patients are the prerequisites to comprehensively deliver genomic data for individualized drug therapy.
