Evidence of Omics, Immune Infiltration, and Pharmacogenomics for BATF in a Pan-Cancer Cohort.
<b>Background:</b> Cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell exhaustion is the major barrier for immunotherapy in tumors. Recent studies have reported that the basic leucine zipper activating transcription factor-like transcription factor (BATF) is responsible for countering cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. Nevertheless, the expression and roles of BATF in tumors have been poorly explored. <b>Methods:</b> In the present study, we conducted a multi-omics analysis, including gene expression, methylation status, DNA alterations, pharmacogenomics, and survival status based on data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to discern expression patterns and prognostic roles of BATF in tumors. We also explored potential roles of BATF in a pan-cancer cohort by performing immune infiltration, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. <i>In vitro</i> assay was also performed to explore roles of BATF in tumor cells. <b>Results:</b> We found that BATF was aberrantly upregulated in 27 types of tumors with respect to the corresponding normal tissues. Abnormal BATF expression in tumors predicted survival times of patients in a tissue-dependent manner. The results of GO, immune infiltration, and KEGG analysis revealed that increased BATF expression in tumors participated in modulating immune cell infiltration <i>via</i> immune-related pathways. BATF expression could also predict immunotherapeutic and chemotherapy responses in cancers. Moreover, knockdown of BATF suppresses tumor cell viability. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our present study reports the vital roles of BATF in tumors and provides a theoretical basis for targeting BATF therapy.
