Pharmacists Leading the Way to Precision Medicine: Updates to the Core Pharmacist Competencies in Genomics.
Genomics is becoming an increasingly important part of health care, and pharmacists are well-positioned to be practice-based leaders in pharmacogenomics and precision medicine. Competencies available through the Genetics/Genomics Competency Center provide a framework for pharmacogenomics instruction in both pharmacy school curricula and continuing education programs. Given the significant advancements in pharmacogenomics over the past decade, the 2019-2020 American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy Pharmacogenomics Special Interest Group updated the pharmacist competencies. The process used a systematic approach which included mapping pharmacogenomics-specific competencies to the entrustable professional activities for pharmacists and seeking consensus from key stakeholders. The result is an expansion to 30 competencies that reflect the contemporary roles pharmacists play in the application of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice. When implemented into curricula, these competencies will ensure that learners are "practice ready" to integrate pharmacogenomics into patient care. Additional postgraduate training is needed for advanced roles in pharmacogenomics implementation, education, and research.
