Role of ADME gene polymorphisms on imatinib disposition: results from a population pharmacokinetic study in chronic myeloid leukaemia.
Imatinib is a substrate of CYP3A4, ABCB1 and ABCG2, and is known to have wide variability in pharmacokinetics (PK). At the same time, a clear relationship between drug levels and response also exists for imatinib in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Therefore, pharmacogenetic-based dosing of imatinib is an attractive proposition. This study aims to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of imatinib in order to identify significant covariates including pharmacogenetic variants.
