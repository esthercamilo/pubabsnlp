Gene-gene and gene-environment interaction data for platinum-based chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.
Gene-gene (GXG) and gene-environment (GXE) interactions play important roles in pharmacogenetics study. Simultaneously incorporating multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and clinical factors is needed to explore the association of their interactions with drug response and toxicity phenotypes. We genotyped 504 SNPs in a total of 490 Chinese non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and the correlation of GXG and GXE interactions with platinum-based chemotherapeutic efficacy and safety were analyzed. In this data descriptor, we shared our data set which could help others to reuse them. All kinds of file types needed for GXG and GXE analysis were supplied. The process of genotyping and data analysis was also introduced step by step.
