Meta-Analysis of the Pharmacogenetics of ARMS2 A69S Polymorphism and the Response to Advanced Age-Related Macular Degeneration.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes irreversible vision loss, and targeted anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is now the most common and effective treatment. The aim of this meta-analysis is to discuss whether genetic polymorphism of ARMS2 A69S could confer susceptibility to advanced AMD with the response to anti-VEGF treatment. We performed a meta-analysis of relevant published studies selected through electronic databases. A total of 21 preferred studies regarding the association between ARMS2 gene and anti-VEGF treatment response in advanced AMD were generally included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that the carriage of G allele for ARMS2 A69S presented a better clinical prognosis for advanced AMD treated with anti-VEGF drugs (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.13-1.69, p = 0.002). In addition, in the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, ARMS2 polymorphisms were more likely to be a positive responder for East Asian patients (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.29-2.16, p < 0.001). This meta-analysis through a series of rigorous methodology data demonstrated a significant association between ARMS2 A69S polymorphism and the anti-VEGF treatment response in advanced AMD, especially among East Asian population. Numerous well-designed, randomized, multicenter clinical trials with large sample size are required to validate the association.
