Influence of rs1080985 single nucleotide polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene on response to treatment with donepezil in patients with alzheimer's disease.
Recent data indicate that the rs1080985 single nucleotide polymorphism of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 gene may affect the response to treatment with donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease. There is also evidence that the common apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism may affect the response to treatment with donepezil in Alzheimer's disease. We investigated the association between response to donepezil and the rs1080985 single nucleotide polymorphism, the minor allele (G) of which was previously reported to be associated with a poor response to this drug in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The common APOE polymorphism was also assessed for its relevance to the outcome of this treatment.
