Novel motif of variable number of tandem repeats in TPMT promoter region and evolutionary association of variable number of tandem repeats with TPMT*3 alleles.
SNPs in the gene for TPMT exemplify one of the most successful translations of pharmacogenomics into clinical practice. This study explains the correlation between common SNPs and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in promoter of the gene.
