Institutional profile: Karolinska Institutet.
Research in pharmacogenomics has been intensive at Karolinska Institutet (KI) for approximately 25 years. Initial initiatives were focused on the identification and characterization of novel CYP2D6 alleles causing ultrarapid or defective drug metabolism. Such discoveries were possible owing to the early implementation of therapeutic drug monitoring and the access to individuals phenotyped with respect to drug metabolism. The translational work at KI has been of utmost importance for successful research, including functional characterization and clinical validation of allelic variants in drug metabolism, as well as discoveries of novel polymorphisms, recent examples being the CYP2C19 and UGT2B17 genes. The clinical pharmacology laboratory at KI campus Huddinge is one of the leading sites for therapeutic drug monitoring in northern Europe and obtains an increasing number of clinical requests, also important for pharmacogenetic research. Furthermore, the recently opened Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, with a clear translational emphasis, offers an opportunity for studying drug metabolism and toxicity in vitro by use of human hepatocytes.
