Practical considerations in genomic decision support: The eMERGE experience.
Genomic medicine has the potential to improve care by tailoring treatments to the individual. There is consensus in the literature that pharmacogenomics (PGx) may be an ideal starting point for real-world implementation, due to the presence of well-characterized drug-gene interactions. Clinical Decision Support (CDS) is an ideal avenue by which to implement PGx at the bedside. Previous literature has established theoretical models for PGx CDS implementation and discussed a number of anticipated real-world challenges. However, work detailing actual PGx CDS implementation experiences has been limited. Anticipated challenges include data storage and management, system integration, physician acceptance, and more.
