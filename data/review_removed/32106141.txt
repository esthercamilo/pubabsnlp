Pharmacogenetic interactions between antiretroviral drugs and vaginally administered hormonal contraceptives.
In AIDS Clinical Trials Group study A5316, efavirenz lowered plasma concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol, given as a vaginal ring, while atazanavir/ritonavir increased etonogestrel and lowered ethinyl estradiol concentrations. We characterized the pharmacogenetics of these interactions.
