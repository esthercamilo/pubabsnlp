Pan-cancer pharmacogenetics: targeted sequencing panels or exome sequencing?
<b>Aim:</b> This study provides clinicians and researchers with an informed choice between current commercially available targeted sequencing panels and exome sequencing panels in the context of pan-cancer pharmacogenetics. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Nine contemporary commercially available targeted pan-cancer panels and the xGen Exome Research Panel v2 were investigated to determine to what extent they cover the pharmacogenetic variant-drug interactions in five available cancer knowledgebases, and the driver mutations and fusion genes in the Cancer Genome Atlas. <b>Results:</b> xGen Exome Research Panel v2 and TrueSight Oncology 500 target 71.0 and 68.9% of the pharmacogenetic interactions in the available knowledgebases; and 93.7 and 86.0% of the driver mutations in the Cancer Genome Atlas, respectively. All other studied panels target lower percentages. <b>Conclusion:</b> Exome sequencing outperforms pan-cancer targeted sequencing panels in terms of covered cancer pharmacogenetic variant-drug interactions and pharmacogenetic cancer variants.
