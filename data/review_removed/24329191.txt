Pharmacogenomics of sterol synthesis and statin use in schizophrenia subjects treated with antipsychotics.
Patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics often develop metabolic side effects including dyslipidemia. Antipsychotics potentially upregulate gene expression of a lipid metabolism pathway protein called SREBP via SREB transcription factors (SREBFs). Genetic variation within SREBF may contribute to dyslipidemias and lipid medication efficacy within schizophrenia.
