Dietary Cholesterol Exacerbates Statin-Induced Hepatic Toxicity in Syrian Golden Hamsters and in Patients in an Observational Cohort Study.
Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is involved in cholesterol synthesis. The major side effects of statins include muscle- and liver-related toxicity. Muscle toxicity is highly associated with polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 proteins (CYPs), as predicted by pharmacogenomics. However, the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity are not well understood. Due to differences in cholesterol metabolism, statins are well tolerated in mice. In contrast, hamsters exhibit metabolic traits similar to humans and are suitable for studying the hepatotoxicity of statins.
