Somatic Mutation Analysis of Human Cancers: Challenges in Clinical Practice.
Somatic mutation analysis of human cancers has become the standard of practice. Whether screening for single gene variants or sequencing hundreds of cancer-related genes, this genomic information is the basis for precision medicine initiatives in oncology. Genomic profiling results in information that allows oncologists to make a more educated selection of appropriate therapeutic strategies that more often combine traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation with novel targeted therapies. Here we discuss the nuances of implementing somatic mutation testing in a clinical setting.
