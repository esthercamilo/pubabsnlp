Evaluation of a clinical pharmacogenetics model to predict methotrexate response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Variability of response to treatment hinders successful management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Consequently, a clinical pharmacogenetics model for predicting response to methotrexate (CP-MTX) has been previously proposed that includes four clinical variables (disease activity, sex, the presence of rheumatoid factor and smoking status) and four SNPs (rs2236225, rs17602729, rs1127354, and rs2372536) in genes of the folate pathway. It showed good performance, but failed to attract attention, likely, in relation with lack of clear clinical benefit. Here, we have revised the value of the CP-MTX model directly addressing its clinical benefit by focusing on the expected benefit-cost of the predictions. In addition, our study included a much larger number of RA patients (n = 720) in MTX monotherapy than previous studies. Benefit of CP-MTX prediction was defined as the patients that would have received combination therapy as first treatment because they were correctly predicted as non-responders to MTX monotherapy. In contrast, cost of CP-MTX prediction was defined as the responder patients that were wrongly predicted as non-responders. Application of CP-MTX predictions to our patients showed a good benefit-cost relationship, with half of the 66.7% non-responders to MTX monotherapy rightly directed to alternative treatments (a benefit of 33.3%) at the cost of 8.5% wrongly predicted non-responders. These benefits-costs were consistent with reanalysis of the previously published studies. Therefore, predictions of CP-MTX showed a good benefit-cost relationship for informing MTX prescription.
