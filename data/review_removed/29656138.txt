Inosine Monophosphate Dehydrogenase Pharmacogenetics in Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Patients.
We evaluated inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) 1 and IMPDH2 pharmacogenetics in 247 recipient-donor pairs after nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Patients were conditioned with total body irradiation + fludarabine and received grafts from related or unrelated donors (10% HLA mismatch), with postgraft immunosuppression of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with a calcineurin inhibitor. Recipient and donor IMPDH genotypes (rs11706052, rs2278294, rs2278293) were not associated with day 28 T cell chimerism, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), disease relapse, cytomegalovirus reactivation, nonrelapse mortality, or overall survival. Recipient IMPDH1 rs2278293 genotype was associated with a lower incidence of chronic GVHD (hazard ratio, .72; P = .008) in nonmyeloablative HCT recipients. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results with the goal of identifying predictive biomarkers to MMF that lower GVHD.
