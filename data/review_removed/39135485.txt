PharmVar GeneFocus: CYP4F2.
The Pharmacogene Variation Consortium (PharmVar) serves as a global repository providing star (*) allele nomenclature for the polymorphic human CYP4F2 gene. CYP4F2 genetic variation impacts the metabolism of vitamin K, which is associated with warfarin dose requirements, and the metabolism of drugs, such as imatinib or fingolimod, and certain endogenous compounds including vitamin E and eicosanoids. This GeneFocus provides a comprehensive overview and summary of CYP4F2 genetic variation including the characterization of 14 novel star alleles, CYP4F2*4 through *17. A description of how haplotype information cataloged by PharmVar is utilized by the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) is also provided.
