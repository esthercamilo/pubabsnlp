Influence of Plasma Concentration of Hsa-Mir-370-3p and Cyp2d6*4 On Equilibrium Concentration of Phenazepam in Patients with Recurrent Depressive Disorder.
Phenazepam is commonly administered to patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Some proportion of such patients do not show adequate response to treatment regimen containing phenazepam, whereas many of them experience type A adverse drug reactions. Previous studies showed that CYP2D6 IS involved in the biotransformation of phenazepam, the activity of which is highly dependent on the polymorphism of the gene encoding it. Objective. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of 1846G>A polymorphism of the CYP2D6 gene on the concentration/dose indicator of phenazepam, using findings on enzymatic activity of CYP2D6 (as evaluated by the 6M-THBC/pinoline ratio measurement) and on CYP2D6 expression level obtained by measuring the hsa-miR-370-3p plasma concentration levels in patients suffering from major depressive disorder.
