Pharmacogenomics competencies in pharmacy practice: A blueprint for change.
The emerging use of genomic data to inform medication therapy populates the medical literature and provides evidence for guidelines in the prescribing information for many medications. Despite the availability of pharmacogenomic studies, few pharmacists feel competent to use these new data in patient care. The first pharmacogenomics competency statement for pharmacists was published in 2002. In 2011, the Pharmacogenomics Special Interest Group of the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy led a process to update this competency statement with the use of a consensus-based method that incorporated input from multiple key professional pharmacy organizations to reflect growth in genomic science as well as the need for pharmacist application of genomic data. Given the rapidly evolving science, educational needs, and practice models in this area, a standardized competency-based approach to pharmacist education and training in pharmacogenomics is needed to equip pharmacists for leadership roles as essential members of health care teams that implement clinical utilization strategies for genomic data.
