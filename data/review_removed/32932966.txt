Effect of <i>CYP3A4</i>*22 and <i>PPAR-α</i> Genetic Variants on Platelet Reactivity in Patients Treated with Clopidogrel and Lipid-Lowering Drugs Undergoing Elective Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.
This study aims to determine whether genetic variants that influence <i>CYP3A4</i> expression are associated with platelet reactivity in clopidogrel-treated patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and to evaluate the influence of statin/fibrate co-medication on these associations. A study cohort was used containing 1124 consecutive elective PCI patients in whom <i>CYP3A4</i>*22 and <i>PPAR-α</i> (G209A and A208G) SNPs were genotyped and the VerifyNow P2Y<sub>12</sub> platelet reactivity test was performed. Minor allele frequencies were 0.4% for <i>CYP3A4</i>*22/*22, 6.8% for <i>PPAR-α</i> G209A AA, and 7.0% for <i>PPAR-α</i> A208G GG. <i>CYP3A4</i>*22 was not associated with platelet reactivity. The <i>PPAR-α</i> genetic variants were significantly associated with platelet reactivity (G209A AA: -24.6 PRU [-44.7, -4.6], <i>p</i> = 0.016; A208G GG: -24.6 PRU [-44.3, -4.8], <i>p</i> = 0.015). Validation of these <i>PPAR-α</i> results in two external cohorts, containing 716 and 882 patients, respectively, showed the same direction of effect, although not statistically significant. Subsequently, meta-analysis of all three cohorts showed statistical significance of both variants in statin/fibrate users (<i>p</i> = 0.04 for <i>PPAR-a</i> G209A and <i>p</i> = 0.03 for A208G), with no difference in statin/fibrate non-users. In conclusion, <i>PPAR-α</i> G209A and A208G were associated with lower platelet reactivity in patients undergoing elective PCI who were treated with clopidogrel and statin/fibrate co-medication. Further research is necessary to confirm these findings.
