Resequencing of VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP4F2 genes in Italian patients requiring extreme low and high warfarin doses.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic variability of VKORC1, CYP2C9 and CYP4F2 genes in patients who required a very low and high warfarin dose, in order to identify novel variants that could help to explain the particular extreme dose requirements.
