Rapid Detection of HLA-B*57:01-Expressing Cells Using a Label-Free Interdigitated Electrode Biosensor Platform for Prevention of Abacavir Hypersensitivity in HIV Treatment.
Pre-treatment screening of individuals for human leukocyte antigens (HLA) HLA-B*57:01 is recommended for the prevention of life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir, a drug widely prescribed for HIV treatment. However, the implementation of screening in clinical practice is hindered by the slow turnaround time and high cost of conventional HLA genotyping methods. We have developed a biosensor platform using interdigitated electrode (IDE) functionalized with a monoclonal antibody to detect cells expressing HLA-B*57:01. This platform was evaluated using cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells expressing different HLA-B alleles. The functionalized IDE sensor was able to specifically capture HLA-B*57:01 cells, resulting in a significant change in the impedance magnitude in 20 min. This IDE platform has the potential to be further developed to enable point-of-care HLA-B*57:01 screening.
