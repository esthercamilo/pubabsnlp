VEGF-A polymorphisms predict progression-free survival among advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with metronomic cyclophosphamide.
No data are available on the pharmacogenetics of metronomic chemotherapy in prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between VEGF-A sequence variants and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), in advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with metronomic cyclophosphamide (CTX), celecoxib and dexamethasone.
