Pan-ERBB kinase inhibition augments CDK4/6 inhibitor efficacy in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), like other squamous carcinomas, harbour highly recurrent cell cycle pathway alterations, especially hyperactivation of the CCND1/CDK4/6 axis, raising the potential for use of existing CDK4/6 inhibitors in these cancers. Although CDK4/6 inhibition has shown striking success when combined with endocrine therapy in oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer, CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib monotherapy has not revealed evidence of efficacy to date in OSCC clinical studies. Herein, we sought to elucidate the identification of key dependencies in OSCC as a foundation for the selection of targets whose blockade could be combined with CDK4/6 inhibition.
