Host-dependent variables: The missing link to personalized medicine.
Individualized medicine has the potential to tailor anticancer therapy with the best response and highest safety margin to provide better patient care. However, modern targeted therapies are still being tested through clinical trials comparing preselected patient cohorts and assessed upon behaviour of group averages. Clinically manifesting malignant disease requires identification of host- and tumour-dependent variables such as biological characteristics of the tumour and its microenvironment including immune response features, and overall capacity of the host to receive, tolerate and efficiently utilize treatment. Contemporary medical oncology including clinical trial design need to refocus from assessing group averages to individuality taking into consideration time dependent host-associated characteristics andÂ reinventing outliers to be appreciated as naturally occurring variables collectively determining the ultimate outcome of malignant disease.
