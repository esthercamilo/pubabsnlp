Further Support for the Involvement of Genetic Variants Related to the Serotonergic Pathway in the Antidepressant Response in Children and Adolescents After a 12-Month Follow-Up: Impact of the <i>HTR2A</i> rs7997012 Polymorphism.
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Fluoxetine is an effective and well-tolerated pharmacological treatment for children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, a high percentage of patients do not respond. There is a substantial genetic contribution to this variable clinical outcome. Based on previous genetic results of our group and given the lack of pharmacogenetics studies of antidepressant response with a long follow-up period, we evaluated the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to the serotonergic pathway on remission and recovery in children and adolescents diagnosed with MDD after 12 months of initiating fluoxetine treatment. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The assessment was performed in 46 patients. All of them were visited at least once a month during the 12-month follow-up. Psychiatrists interviewed patients and their parents to explore clinical improvement. A total of 75 genotyped SNPs in 10 candidate genes were included in the genetic association analysis with remission and recovery. Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied to avoid false positive results. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The <i>HTR2A</i> rs7997012 SNP was significantly associated after Bonferroni correction with clinical improvement. Particularly, the homozygotes for the major allele (GG) showed the highest percentage of remitters and the highest score reductions on the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scale. Moreover, although the results were on the border of statistical significance, the GG homozygotes also tended to experience fewer readmissions during the follow-up period <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> These results provide more evidence of the involvement of genetic variants related to the serotonergic pathway in the antidepressant response. Studies with larger cohorts are needed to integrate all relevant variants into clinical predictors of antidepressant response.
