Influence of glutathione S transferase A1 gene polymorphism (-69C > T, rs3957356) on intravenous cyclophosphamide efficacy and side effects: a case-control study in Egyptian patients with lupus nephritis.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease. Cyclophosphamide (CYC) is a cytotoxic drug of a narrow therapeutic window that is commonly used in lupus nephritis (LN) treatment. However, 30-40% of patients experience CYC resistance. CYC inactivation is mediated by the glutathione S transferases (GSTs) superfamily: GST class A (GSTA) has the greatest activity and contains 5 isoenzymes. Polymorphisms of genes involved in the drug metabolism could alter the drug pharmacokinetics and effectiveness. CYC pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics are extensively studied in malignancies; however, scarce data are available about this issue in the autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Prediction of the drug response helps the achievement of the highest benefit-to-risk ratio. The aim of this case-control study was to address the association between GSTA1 polymorphism (-69C > T, rs3957356), and the rate of response to and side effects of intravenous CYC in LN patients.
