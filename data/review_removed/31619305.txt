Molecular pathway analysis associates alterations in obesity-related genes and antipsychotic-induced weight gain.
Antipsychotics often induce excessive weight gain. We hypothesised that individuals with genetic variations related to known obesity-risk genes have an increased risk of excessive antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG). This hypothesis was tested in a subset of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial data set.
