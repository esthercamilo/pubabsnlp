Critical aspects of microsatellite instability testing in endometrial cancer: a comparison study.
The identification of mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) and microsatellite unstable (MSI) endometrial cancers (ECs) is important in screening, diagnosis, and therapeutic stratification of patients. We compared the diagnostic performance of 4 MSI molecular tests based on fragment length assay in capillary electrophoresis (OncoMate™ MSI assay, Promega) and in microcapillary electrophoresis (TapeStation 4200, Agilent); with high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis approaches (Idylla™ MSI Test, Biocartis; EasyPGX® ready MSI, Diatech Pharmacogenetics) on a series of 56 ECs, which was well characterized for MMR status with immunohistochemical approach (IHC, nonmolecular reference test). The concordance of fluorescence capillary electrophoresis with IHC (AUC 0.98) was higher respect to the other molecular methodologies. Otherwise, HRM approaches and microcapillary electrophoresis platform failed to detect MSI-ECs showing minimal microsatellite shifts. In conclusion, in colorectal site, several technologies are eligible for MSI test, whereas in ECs, MSI test should be based on fluorescent capillary electrophoresis as it identifies a higher proportion of cases that could be misdiagnosed with other strategies.
