Pharmacogenetics at scale in real-world bioresources: CYP2C19 and clopidogrel outcomes in UK Biobank.
The impact of CYP2C19 genotype on clopidogrel outcomes is one of the most well established pharmacogenetic interactions, supported by robust evidence and recommended by the Food and Drug Administration and clinical pharmacogenetics implementation consortium. However, there is a scarcity of large-scale real-world data on the extent of this pharmacogenetic effect, and clinical testing for the CYP2C19 genotype remains infrequent. This study utilizes the UK Biobank dataset, including 10 365 patients treated with clopidogrel, to offer the largest observational analysis of these pharmacogenetic effects to date.
