Do genetic polymorphisms alter patient response to inhaled bronchodilators?
Short- and long-acting Î² agonists (SABA and LABA) are bronchodilators for treating asthma. Bronchodilator response (BDR) is quantified by measuring air expired in the first second during a forced expiratory maneuver, prior to and following inhalation of SABA. BDR has been associated with a significant degree of heterogeneity, in part attributable to genetic variation. Heritability, the proportion of phenotypic variability accounted for by genetic variation is estimated to account for 50% of pulmonary function and 28.5% for BDR.
