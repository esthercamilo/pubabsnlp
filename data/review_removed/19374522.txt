CYP2D6 genotyping for psychiatric patients treated with risperidone: considerations for cost-effectiveness studies.
In order to ascertain data availability and feasibility for conducting cost-effectiveness studies in pharmacogenetics, and as part of a European Commission Joint Research Center, Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) study, data concerning risperidone use and cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6) genotyping in medical care was collected in Germany, Spain and the USA, and are summarized in this perspective. The gene coding for CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic, resulting in a significant part of the population being poor metabolizers and ultrarapid metabolizers. Individuals who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, have an increased risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) when treated with CYP2D6-metabolized drugs, suggesting that CYP2D6 genotyping might be beneficial for patient care. This might be especially important in psychiatry, where approximately 50% of the patients use at least one drug primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. In particular, ADRs and poor response to treatment are major problems for some antipsychotics, including risperidone. However, there are no published cost-effectiveness studies on CYP2D6 genotyping, and the benefit that pharmacogenetic testing might represent by identifying problematic patients is still unclear. The present European Commission study found that current clinical and economical data concerning the frequency and direct healthcare costs of risperidone-related ADRs, the relation of such ADRs with the patients CYP2D6 genotypes, and costs for CYP2D6 genotyping, are not sufficient for determining if routine CYP2D6 genotyping might be cost beneficial for patients treated with risperidone. Therefore, efforts should be put on performing prospective cost-benefit studies with randomized treatment according to the CYP2D6 genotype to establish the utility of CYP2D6 genotyping for personalizing antipsychotic treatment.
