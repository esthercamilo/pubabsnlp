Assessment of primary care practitioners' attitudes and interest in pharmacogenomic testing.
<b>Aims:</b> Identify the attitudes and interests of primary care providers (PCPs) in applying clinical pharmacogenomics (PGx) test results. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A questionnaire was designed and then disseminated to PCPs across the MedStar Health System. <b>Results:</b> Ninety of 312 (29%) PCPs responded and were included in analyses. Seventy-six (84%) had heard of PGx and 12 (13%) previously ordered PGx testing. Most, 68 (76%), believed PGx can improve care; however, a minority, 23 (26%), reported confidence in using PGx in prescribing decisions. Sixty-four (70%) wanted a pharmacist consultation. PCPs desired PGx for antidepressants (75%), proton pump inhibitors (72%) and other medications. <b>Conclusion:</b> Most PCPs felt unprepared to interpret PGx results and desired pharmacist consultations. These data can inform future PGx implementations with PCPs.
