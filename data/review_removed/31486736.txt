<i>CYP2C9*2</i> is associated with indomethacin treatment failure for patent ductus arteriosus.
<b>Aims:</b> To identify clinical andgenetic factors associated with indomethacin treatment failure in preterm neonates with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). <b>Patients & Methods:</b> This is a multicenter cohort study of 144 preterm infants (22-32 weeks gestational age) at three centers who received at least one treatment course of indomethacin for PDA. Indomethacin failure was defined as requiring subsequent surgical intervention. <b>Results:</b> In multivariate analysis, gestational age (AOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.96), surfactant use (AOR 9.77, 95% CI 1.15-83.26), and <i>CYP2C9*2</i> (AOR 3.74; 95% CI 1.34-10.44) were each associated with indomethacin failure. <b>Conclusion:</b> Age, surfactant use, and <i>CYP2C9*2</i> influence indomethacin treatment outcome in preterm infants with PDA. This combination of clinical and genetic factors may facilitate targeted indomethacin use for PDA.
