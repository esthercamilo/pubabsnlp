Influence of <i>CYP2C19</i>, <i>CYP2D6</i>, and <i>ABCB1</i> Gene Variants and Serum Levels of Escitalopram and Aripiprazole on Treatment-Emergent Sexual Dysfunction: A Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression 1 (CAN-BIND 1) Study.
Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction is frequently reported by individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) on antidepressants, which negatively impacts treatment adherence and efficacy. We investigated the association of polymorphisms in pharmacokinetic genes encoding cytochrome-P450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, <i>CYP2C19</i> and <i>CYP2D6</i>, and the transmembrane efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (i.e., <i>ABCB1</i>), on treatment-emergent changes in sexual function (SF) and sexual satisfaction (SS) in the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression 1 (CAN-BIND-1) sample.
