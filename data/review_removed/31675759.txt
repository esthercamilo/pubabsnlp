A6 neurons simultaneously modulate active expiration and upper airway resistance in rats.
What is the central question of this study? Do A6 neurons modulate active expiratory and airway responses evoked by hypercapnia/acidosis? What is the main finding and its importance? Acute inhibition of A6 neurons reduced active expiratory, inspiratory and the associated oropharyngeal and laryngeal motor responses to hypercapnia/acidosis. A6 neurons provide excitatory synaptic drive contributing to the central generation of inspiratory and expiratory motor activity as well as the control of upper airway resistance.
