Assessment of pharmacogenomic SLCO1B1 assay for prediction of neuromuscular pain in type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular patients: preliminary results.
At present, several strategies for preventing neuromuscular pain in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) have been investigated. Recently, findings on genetic variants associated with adverse events to statin-based therapy have been reported. The study aimed at measuring whether Pharmacogenomics (PGx) profile can affect neuromuscular pain in patients carrying T2DM and cardiovascular diseases. An extensive panel of 5 polymorphisms on 4 candidate genes, previously validated as significant markers related to Sulphonylureas and Glitinides (SU-G) plus Simvastatin neuromuscular toxicity, is herein analyzed and discussed.
