Stakeholder perspectives on a risk-benefit framework for genetic testing.
A key to accelerating the appropriate integration of genomic applications into healthcare in the coming decades will be the ability to assess the tradeoffs between clinical benefits and clinical risks of genetic tests in a timely manner. Several factors limit the ability of stakeholders to achieve this objective, including the lack of direct evidence, the lack of a framework to quantitatively assess risk and benefit, and the lack of a formal analytic approach to assess uncertainty. We propose that a formal, quantitative risk-benefit framework may be particularly useful for assessing genetic tests intended to influence health outcomes, and communicating the potential clinical benefits, harms, and uncertainty to stakeholders. As part of the development process for such a framework, a stakeholder meeting was held in Seattle (Wash., USA) in December of 2008, with the objective of discussing a risk-benefit framework, using warfarin pharmacogenomics as a case study. Participants engaged in focused discussion to elucidate the potential role of genetic test risk-benefit analysis in informing decision-making, categorizing genetic tests and directing research prioritization. This research investigation focuses on qualitative analysis of responses elicited from workshop participants during the proceedings of the workshop session. The major findings of the workshop were: (1) stakeholder support for risk-benefit modeling as a tool to structure discussion of the clinical utility of genetic tests; (2) desire for the modeling process to be iterative, transparent, and parsimonious in its presentation to stakeholders, and (3) some concern with the use of quality-adjusted life-years in the evaluation process. The meeting's findings emphasize the potential utility of risk-benefit analysis in genetic test evaluation, and highlight key areas for future research and stakeholder consensus-building.
