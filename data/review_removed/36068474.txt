Pharmacogenomics of Opioid Treatment for Pain Management.
Pain affects approximately 100 million Americans. Pain harms quality of life and costs patients billions of dollars per year. Clinically, nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies can alleviate acute and chronic pain suffering. Opioids are one type of medication used to manage pain. However, opioids can potentially create dependence and substance abuse, and the effects are not consistent in all patients. Pharmacogenomics is the study of the genome to understand the effects of drugs on individual patients based on their genetic information. Through pharmacogenomics, researchers can investigate genetic polymorphisms related to pain that maximize individual patient drug responses and minimize toxicity. This chapter discusses the pharmacogenomics of opioids to treat pain, including individual genetic differences to opioid treatments, opioid pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and the genetic polymorphisms associated with individual opioid medications.
