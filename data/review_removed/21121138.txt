[Pharmacogenetics in cardiovascular diseases therapy--treatment according guidelines or according the individual requirement?].
In clinical practice the individual response to a drug represents a great problem. Many of us experienced a situation when the drug effect declined or drug-related toxic reaction occurred. The typical example is the variation of optimal warfarin dosage. The main cause of interindividual differences in the drug response is the polymorphism in drug resorption and elimination systems, enzymes responsible for drug biotransformation, target receptors or signal molecules. The individualized drug therapy requires physicians to be oriented in main causes of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variations and be able to predict accurately the individual drug response.
