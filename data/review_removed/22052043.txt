Delivering a pharmacogenetic service: is there a role for genetic counselors?
Pharmacogenetics, the use of genetic information to direct safer and or more effective prescription of medication, is a relatively new clinical concept. Currently, there is no consensus regarding which healthcare professionals should deliver pharmacogenetic services. This study explored the opinions of genetic counselors about their potential role in delivering pharmacogenetic services. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 14 genetic counselors. Four vignettes describing pharmacogenetic testing scenarios were used to elicit views on specific clinical applications. Data were analysed using the constant comparative method. Opinions varied, but the majority of interviewees suggested that genetic counselors could have a role. However, participants suggested that additional training would be needed due to counselors' limited knowledge of pharmacogenetics. Employing genetic counselors in a specialist role within a multidisciplinary clinic was suggested as a model of service delivery. Service models developed for pharmacogenetic testing may need to be adapted according to the issues presented by each type of test.
