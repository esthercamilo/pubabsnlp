The Role of <i>Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase</i> and <i>Thymidylate Synthase</i> Polymorphisms in Fluoropyrimidine-Based Cancer Chemotherapy in an Iranian Population.
The fluoropyrimidine drug 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and the prodrug capecitabine have been extensively used for treatment of many types of cancer including colorectal, gastric, head and neck. Approximately, 10 to 25% of patients suffer from severe fluoropyrimidine-induced toxicity. This may lead to dose reduction and treatment discontinuation. Pharmacogenetics research could be useful for the identification of predictive markers in chemotherapy treatment. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of five genetic polymorphisms within two genes (<i>DPYD, TYMS</i>) in toxicity and efficacy of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.
