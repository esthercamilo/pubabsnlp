Assessment of Substrate Status of Drugs Metabolized by Polymorphic Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2 Enzymes: An Analysis of a Large-Scale Dataset.
The analysis of substrates of polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is important information to enable drug-drug interactions (DDIs) analysis and the relevance of pharmacogenetics in this context in large datasets. Our aim was to compare different approaches to assess the substrate properties of drugs for certain polymorphic CYP2 enzymes.
