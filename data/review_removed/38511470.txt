Implementation of whole-exome sequencing for pharmacogenomics profiling and exploring its potential clinical utilities.
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) is widely used in clinical settings; however, the exploration of its use in pharmacogenomic analysis remains limited. Our study compared the variant callings for 28 core absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination genes by WES and array-based technology using clinical trials samples. The results revealed that WES had a positive predictive value of 0.71-0.92 and a sensitivity of single-nucleotide variants between 0.68 and 0.95, compared with array-based technology, for the variants in the commonly targeted regions of the WES and PhamacoScanâ„¢ assay. Besides the common variants detected by both assays, WES identified 200-300 exclusive variants per sample, totalling 55 annotated exclusive variants, including important modulators of metabolism such as rs2032582 (<i>ABCB1</i>) and rs72547527 (<i>SULT1A1</i>). This study highlights the potential clinical advantages of using WES to identify a wider range of genetic variations and enabling precision medicine.
