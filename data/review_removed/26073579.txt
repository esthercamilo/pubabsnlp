Mechanism of sulfotransferase pharmacogenetics in altered xenobiotic metabolism.
Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs), one of the vital enzymes of detoxication, catalyze the sulfation of native and exogenous hydrophobic molecules. Xenobiotic accumulation can induce a variety of diseases, including cancers. Sulfation facilitates the solubilization and removal of xenobiotics. However, sulfation may activate the pharmacological activities of xenobiotics.
