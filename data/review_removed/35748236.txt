The frequency of major <i>CYP2C19</i> genetic polymorphisms in women of Asian, Native HawaiianÂ and Pacific Islander subgroups.
<b>Aim:</b> Prevalence of clinically actionable genetic variants of <i>CYP2C19</i> is lacking in specific population subgroups. This study aims to assess the frequencies of <i>CYP2C19*2</i>, <i>*3</i>, and <i>*17</i> in Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) population subgroups compared with Europeans. <b>Patients & methods:</b> The study included repository DNA samples of 1064 women, 18 years or older, who self-reported as Filipino, Korean, Japanese, Native Hawaiian, Marshallese and Samoan. <b>Results:</b> The overall frequencies of <i>CYP2C19*2</i> (25-36%) and <i>CYP2C19*3</i> (2.5-10%) were significantly higher in all our subgroups than in Europeans (15 and 0.02%, respectively). The overall frequency of <i>CYP2C19*17</i> was significantly lower in all our subgroups (1-6%) than in Europeans (21.7%). <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first report on the frequencies of <i>CYP2C19*2</i>, <i>*3</i>, and <i>*17</i> in women of Asian and NHPI descent with distinct population subgroup differences. Differential allele frequencies of <i>CYP2C19</i> among population subgroups underscore the importance of increasing racial and ethnic diversity in pharmacogenetic research.
