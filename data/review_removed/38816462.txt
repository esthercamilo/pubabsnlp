Pharmacogenomics of coronary artery response to intravenous gamma globulin in kawasaki disease.
Kawasaki disease (KD) is a multisystem inflammatory illness of infants and young children that can result in acute vasculitis. The mechanism of coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) in KD despite intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) treatment is not known. We performed a Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) association analysis in a racially diverse cohort of KD patients treated with IVIG, both using AHA guidelines. We defined coronary aneurysm (CAA) (N = 234) as coronary z ≥ 2.5 and large coronary aneurysm (CAA/L) (N = 92) as z ≥ 5.0. We conducted logistic regression models to examine the association of genetic variants with CAA/L during acute KD and with persistence >6 weeks using an additive model between cases and 238 controls with no CAA. We adjusted for age, gender and three principal components of genetic ancestry. The top significant variants associated with CAA/L were in the intergenic regions (rs62154092 p < 6.32E-08 most significant). Variants in SMAT4, LOC100127, PTPRD, TCAF2 and KLRC2 were the most significant non-intergenic SNPs. Functional mapping and annotation (FUMA) analysis identified 12 genomic risk loci with eQTL or chromatin interactions mapped to 48 genes. Of these NDUFA5 has been implicated in KD CAA and MICU and ZMAT4 has potential functional implications. Genetic risk score using these 12 genomic risk loci yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86. This pharmacogenomics study provides insights into the pathogenesis of CAA/L in IVIG-treated KD and shows that genomics can help define the cause of CAA/L to guide management and improve risk stratification of KD patients.
