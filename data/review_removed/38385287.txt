Use of Genomics to Develop Novel Therapeutics and Personalize Hypertension Therapy.
Hypertension is a prevalent public health problem, contributing to >10 million deaths annually. Though multiple therapeutics exist, many patients suffer from treatment-resistant hypertension or try several medications before achieving blood pressure control. Genomic advances offer mechanistic understanding of blood pressure variability, therapeutic targets, therapeutic response, and promise a stratified approach to treatment of primary hypertension. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate augmentation, aldosterone synthase inhibitors, and angiotensinogen blockade with silencing RNA and antisense therapies are among the promising novel approaches. Pharmacogenomic studies have also been done to explore the genetic bases underpinning interindividual variability in response to existing therapeutics. A polygenic approach using risk scores is likely to be the next frontier in stratifying responses to existing therapeutics.
