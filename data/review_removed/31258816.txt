Norwegian drug information centres strongly promote person-centred and personalised medicine: a brief report on the achievements and strategy.
The Norwegian network of drug information centres (RELIS) has achievements in person-centred and personalised medicine. RELIS receive questions from physicians, pharmacists, nurses and other health professionals and provide decision support in all aspects of pharmacotherapy. Questions associated with person-centred medicine often include problems with unrealistic risk perception and poor adherence among patients. Questions associated with personalised medicine frequently concern comorbidity, biomarkers and pharmacogenetics. The questions frequently include a mix of problems related to health and disease care. The RELIS staff addresses each question in a problem-oriented approach with expertise in pharmacology and skills in searching and critical evaluation of the literature. A written answer can describe decision support concerning patient empowerment, further diagnostics and preferences in pharmacotherapy including advice with regard to choice of drug and dose to a patient. Links to online resources and attached references for further reading are often included in the answers. The question-answer service is documented in a full-text, searchable question-answer database. Additional drug information activities towards clinicians and patients, and a multi-professional staff with pharmacists and clinical pharmacologists, are important elements in RELIS drug information strategy, and it is essentially relevant to predictive, preventive and personalised medicine (PPPM).
