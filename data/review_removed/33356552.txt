Assessment and clinical utility of pharmacogenomics by healthcare practitioners in North Carolina.
<b>Aim:</b> Perceived knowledge, useÂ and perceptions of pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing were assessed among healthcare practitioners in North Carolina. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A validated survey was distributed to various healthcare professionals and analyzed for differences among the groups. <b>Results:</b> The majority of the 744 survey respondents acknowledged the perceived benefits of PGx testing, but indicated either never or rarely using it. A substantial percentage of practitioners reported educational experiences but the majority had received no training. Among groups reporting using PGx testing, barriers to implementation were cost and insufficient training. <b>Conclusion:</b> The perceived cost of PGx testing and insufficiency or lack of training are major contributing factors to the infrequent use of PGx testing by healthcare providers in North Carolina.
