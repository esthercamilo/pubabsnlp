Letter to the editor: "Beyond nimodipine: advanced neuroprotection strategies for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia".
This letter commends the article by Luzzi et al. on alternative neuroprotection strategies for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It highlights the pharmacological advantages of nicardipine, cilostazol, and clazosentan over nimodipine in managing cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia. Emphasizing the need for personalized medicine, it advocates for integrating genetic screening and advanced monitoring techniques to tailor treatments to individual patient profiles. This approach could significantly improve clinical outcomes by optimizing drug efficacy and minimizing adverse effects.
