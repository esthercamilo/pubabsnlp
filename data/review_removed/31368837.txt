Genetic variants and interactions from a pharmacist-led pharmacogenomics service for PACE.
<b>Aim:</b> Evaluate results of pharmacogenomics testing for participants enrolled in the Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). <b>Materials & methods:</b> A convenience sample of 100 participants from the PHARM-GENOME-PACE study. Genetic variants were determined by pharmacogenomics testing. Drug-gene interactions (DGIs), drug-drug-gene interactions (DDGIs) and phenoconversions were interrogated from a clinical decision support system. <b>Results:</b> In total, 146 genetic variants, 169 DGIs and 125 DDGIs were detected. DGIs and DDGIs occurred most commonly with the <i>CYP2D6</i> gene (36.1 and 39.2%, respectively). There were 280 instances of phenoconversions; majority (62.9%) affecting the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. <b>Conclusion:</b> Prevalence of exposures to DGIs and DDGIs among PACE participants is high. Pharmacists using aÂ clinical decision support system can support PACE practitioners with assessing multidrug simultaneous interactions. <b>Clinical trial registration:</b> NCT03257605.
