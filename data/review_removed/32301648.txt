Cost-effectiveness of combinatorial pharmacogenomic testing for depression from the Canadian public payer perspective.
<b>Aim:</b> Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of combinatorial pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing, versus treatment as usual (TAU), to guide treatment for patients with depression, from the Canadian public healthcare system perspective. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Clinical and economic data associated with depression were extracted from published literature. Clinical (quality-adjusted life years; QALYs) and economic (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) outcomes were modeled using combinatorial PGx and TAU treatment strategies across a 5-year time horizon. <b>Results:</b> With the combinatorial PGx strategy to guide treatment, patients were projected to gain 0.14-0.19 QALYs versus TAU. Accounting for test price, combinatorial PGx saved CADÂ $1,687-$3,056 versus TAU. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from -$11,861 to -$16,124/QALY gained. <b>Conclusion:</b> Combinatorial PGx testing was more efficacious and less costly compared with the TAU for depression.
