Personalised Medicine: The Odyssey from Hope to Practice.
In this endeavour, inspired by the Odyssey, we aim to embark with the reader on a journey on a ship from Troy to Ithaca, coursing through the history of the momentous events and achievements that paved the way for personalised medicine. We will set sail amidst important genetic discoveries, beginning with the discovery of the first human genome, and voyage through the projects that contributed to the progress of pharmacogenomic studies. Concurrently, we will propose methods to overcome the obstacles that are slowing the potential full implementation of accumulated knowledge into everyday practice. This journey aims to reflect on the frontiers of current genetic knowledge and the practical use of this knowledge in preventive, diagnostic and pharmacogenomic approaches to directly impact the socio-economic aspects of public health.
