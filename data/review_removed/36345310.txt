Acute liver failure associated with lamotrigine in children with epilepsy: A report of two cases and thoughts on pharmacogenomics.
Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a rare and life-threatening clinical syndrome for which drug-induced liver injury is a cause. Lamotrigine (LTG) is generally a safe and effective antiseizure medication, and PALF related to LTG has rarely been reported. Here, we describe two cases of PALF associated with LTG in children with epilepsy. In both patients, LTG was used in combination with valproic acid at an initial dose exceeding the recommended dose, which increased the risk of adverse reactions. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms of genes associated with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LTG were selected for pharmacogenomic testing. However, the results revealed that genotypes of the patients had variable effects on the serum concentration and therapeutic responsiveness of LTG and therefore did not explain the clinical manifestations well. The findings of this case report caution clinicians to be aware of the risk of liver failure when using antiseizure medication in polytherapy, especially LTG in combination with valproic acid. When administered to children, the recommended dosage of LTG should be strictly followed. Further pharmacogenomic studies are needed to help improve the efficacy and safety of epilepsy treatment in the future.
