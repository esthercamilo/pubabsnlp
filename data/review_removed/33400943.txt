Effects of CYP2D6, CYP3A5, and ABCB1 gene polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of two risperidone long-acting injection microsphere formulations.
LY03004, a novel investigational risperidone long-acting injection (LAI) microsphere formulation, can release risperidone more quickly after injection than Risperdal Consta®. This study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of LY03004 compared with those on Risperdal Consta®.
