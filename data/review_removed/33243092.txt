Effect of <i>CYP3A5</i>*3 genotypes on lumefantrine plasma concentrations among malaria-HIV-infected women.
<b>Aim:</b> We aimed to assess the effect of a functional polymorphism of CYP3A5 on lumefantrine pharmacokinetics. <b>Patients & methods:</b> Sixty-nine women diagnosed with malaria received standard doses of artemether-lumefantrine. Concentration-time data for lumefantrine and genotyping data were obtained for each participant. Pharmacokinetic-genotype associative relationships were assessed using linear regressions, Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis statistics. <b>Results:</b> Average age and weight (standard deviation) of the patients were 33 (6.8) years and 59.5 (11.6) kg, respectively. <i>CYP3A5*3</i> genotype associated with the log-transformed maximum concentration with the median (interquartile range) values of 8279 (6516-13,420) and 6331 (4093-8631) ng/ml (p = 0.032) among the carriers and noncarriers of <i>CYP3A5*3</i>, respectively. Besides, the <i>NR1I3</i> c.152-1089T>C genotypes had an associative trend with the lumefantrine area under the curve (AUC<sub>0-96h</sub>) and clearance. <b>Conclusion:</b><i>CYP3A5</i>*3 genetic variant is associated with a high maximum plasma concentration of lumefantrine. This warrants further investigations on the association between <i>CYP3A5*3</i> gene variants, lumefantrine pharmacokinetics and electrophysiological effect.
