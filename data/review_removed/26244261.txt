Dihydropyrimidinase and Î²-ureidopropionase gene variation and severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity.
To assess the association of DPYS and UPB1 genetic variation, encoding the catabolic enzymes downstream of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, with early-onset toxicity from fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.
