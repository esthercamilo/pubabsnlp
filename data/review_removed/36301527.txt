Role of Pharmacogenomics in Comprehensive Medication Management: Considerations for Employers.
Rising prescription costs, poor medication adherence, and safety issues pose persistent challenges to employer-sponsored health care plans and their beneficiaries. Comprehensive medication management (CMM), a patient-centered approach to medication optimization, enriched by pharmacogenomics (PGx), has been shown to improve the efficacy and safety of pharmaceutical regimens. This has contributed to improved health care outcomes, reduced costs of treatments, better adherence, shorter durations of treatment, and fewer adverse effects from drug therapy. Despite compelling clinical and economic evidence to justify the application of CMM guided by PGx, implementation in clinical settings remains sparse; notable barriers include limited physician adoption and health insurance coverage. Ultimately, these challenges may be overcome through comprehensive programs that include clinical decision support systems and education through employer-sponsored population health management channels to the benefit of the employees, employers, health care providers, and health care systems. This article discusses benefits, considerations, and barriers of scalable PGx-enriched CMM programs in the context of self-insured employers.
