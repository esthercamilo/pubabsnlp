Genetic Variations Associated with Long-Term Treatment Response in Bipolar Depression.
Several pharmacogenetic-based decision support tools for psychoactive medication selection are available. However, the scientific evidence of the gene-drug pairs analyzed is mainly based on pharmacogenetic studies in patients with major depression or schizophrenia, and their clinical utility is mostly assessed in major depression. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of individual genes, with pharmacogenetic relevance in other psychiatric conditions, in the response to treatment in bipolar depression. Seventy-six patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder and an index major depressive episode were included in an observational retrospective study. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected, and all patients were genotyped using a commercial multigene pharmacogenomic-based tool (Neuropharmagen<sup>Â®</sup>, AB-Biotics S.A., Barcelona, Spain). Multiple linear regression was used to identify pharmacogenetic and clinical predictors of efficacy and tolerability of medications. The pharmacogenetic variables response to serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (<i>ABCB1</i>) and reduced metabolism of quetiapine (<i>CYP3A4</i>) predicted patient response to these medications, respectively. <i>ABCB1</i> was also linked to the tolerability of SNRIs. An mTOR-related multigenic predictor was also associated with a lower number of adverse effects when including switch and autolytical ideation. Our results suggest that the predictors identified could be useful to guide the pharmacological treatment in bipolar disorder. Additional clinical studies are necessary to confirm these findings.
