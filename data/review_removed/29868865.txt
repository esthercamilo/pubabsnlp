Drug metabolism and transport gene polymorphisms and efavirenz adverse effects in Brazilian HIV-positive individuals.
There are limited data regarding efavirenz pharmacogenetics in admixed populations. The Brazilian population is highly admixed. In a Brazilian cohort, we sought to characterize associations between efavirenz adverse effects (all-cause and CNS) and polymorphisms in seven genes known or suspected to affect efavirenz metabolism and transport.
