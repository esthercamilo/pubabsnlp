Knowledge and attitudes of incoming pharmacy students toward pharmacogenomics and survey reliability.
<b>Aims:</b> To assess knowledge and attitudes toward pharmacogenomics (PGx) of incoming doctoral pharmacy students, to evaluate the internal structure and reliability of the PGx survey and to identify variables associated with the different responses. <b>Methods:</b> A PGx survey based on the core pharmacist competencies in PGx was created. <b>Results:</b> Of 83.2% analyzable responses, 91% believed PGx is a useful tool and relevant to future practice but over 70% stated they lack confidence in clinical PGx knowledge. This 38-item PGx survey included three factors showing high reliability. Prior genetic/PGx testing and unsatisfactory medication experiences were associated with a more positive attitude toward PGx. <b>Conclusion:</b> The majority of students have positive attitudes toward PGx, but lack knowledge in genetic concepts and clinical PGx.
