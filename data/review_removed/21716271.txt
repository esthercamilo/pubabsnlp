Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines for cytochrome P450-2C19 (CYP2C19) genotype and clopidogrel therapy.
CYP2C19 is one of the principal enzymes involved in the bioactivation of the antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel. A common loss-of-function allele, <i>CYP2C19*2</i> (c.681G>A; rs4244285), is associated with increased risk for serious adverse cardiovascular events in both heterozygous and homozygous patients (~25–50% of the population) with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) who are receiving clopidogrel, particularly among those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We provide evidence from published literature and guidelines for <i>CYPC19</i> genotype–directed antiplatelet therapy (periodically updated at http://www.pharmgkb.org).
