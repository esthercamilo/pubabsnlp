Effects of CYP2D6 activity on the efficacy and safety of mirtazapine in patients with depressive disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorder.
The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of CYP2D6 activity on the efficacy and safety of mirtazapine in patients with depressive disorders and comorbid alcohol use disorder who received mirtazapine. The study included 109 Russian patients who received mirtazapine at a dose of 30.0 [15.0; 45.0] mg per day. Genotyping of <i>CYP2D6*4</i> (<i>1846G > A</i>, <i>rs3892097</i>) was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction with allele-specific hybridization. The activity of CYP2D6 was evaluated by determining the concentration of endogenous substrate of the enzyme and its urinary metabolite - pinoline to 6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-beta-carboline ratio, using high-performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. The statistically significant differences between the scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) in patients with different genotypes were revealed by day 16: (<i>GG</i>) 5.0 [3.0; 6.0], (<i>GA</i>) 1.5 [1.0; 3.2] (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and for the The UKU Side Effects Rating Scale (UKU): (<i>GG</i>) 6.0 [6.0; 7.0], (<i>GA</i>) 8.5 [8.0; 10.0] (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The calculation of correlation coefficients between the differences in scale scores and metabolic rate showed the presence of statistically significant weak inverse correlation with the efficacy indicator evaluated by HAMD (<i>r</i> = -0.278, <i>p</i> < 0.05), but not by UKU (<i>r</i> = 0.274, <i>p</i> > 0.05). This study demonstrated that an increased CYP2D6 activity reduces the efficacy of treatment with mirtazapine.
