Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations of general anesthesia in pediatric subjects.
<b>Introduction:</b> The target concentration strategy uses PKPD information for dose determination. Models have also quantified exposure-response relationships, improved understanding of developmental pharmacokinetics, rationalized dose prescription, provided insight into the importance of covariate information, explained drug interactions and driven decision-making and learning during drug development.<b>Areas covered:</b> The prime PKPD consideration is parameter estimation and quantification of variability. The main sources of variability in children are age (maturation) and weight (size). Model use is mostly confined to pharmacokinetics, partly because anesthesia effect models in the young are imprecise. Exploration of PK and PD covariates and their variability hold potential to better individualize treatment.<b>Expert opinion:</b> The ability to model drugs using computer-based technology is hindered because covariate data required to individualize treatment using these programs remain lacking. Target concentration intervention strategies remain incomplete because covariate information that might better predict individualization of dose is absent. Pharmacogenomics appear a valuable area for investigation for pharmacodynamics and pharmacodynamics. Effect measures in the very young are imprecise. Assessment of the analgesic component of anesthesia is crude. While neuromuscular monitoring is satisfactory, depth of anaesthesia EEG interpretation is inadequate. Closed loop anesthesia is possible with better understanding of EEG changes.
