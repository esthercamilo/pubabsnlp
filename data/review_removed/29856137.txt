Taq1A polymorphism and medication effects on inhibitory action control in Parkinson disease.
Dopamine therapy in Parkinson disease (PD) can have differential effects on inhibitory action control, or the ability to inhibit reflexive or impulsive actions. Dopamine agonist (DAAg) medications, which preferentially target D2 and D3 receptors, can either improve or worsen control of impulsive actions in patients with PD. We have reported that the direction of this effect depends on baseline levels of performance on inhibitory control tasks. This observation suggests that there may exist certain biologic determinants that contribute to these patient-specific differences. We hypothesized that one important factor might be functional polymorphisms in D2-like receptor genes.
