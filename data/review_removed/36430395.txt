DRPreter: Interpretable Anticancer Drug Response Prediction Using Knowledge-Guided Graph Neural Networks and Transformer.
Some of the recent studies on drug sensitivity prediction have applied graph neural networks to leverage prior knowledge on the drug structure or gene network, and other studies have focused on the interpretability of the model to delineate the mechanism governing the drug response. However, it is crucial to make a prediction model that is both knowledge-guided and interpretable, so that the prediction accuracy is improved and practical use of the model can be enhanced. We propose an interpretable model called DRPreter (drug response predictor and interpreter) that predicts the anticancer drug response. DRPreter learns cell line and drug information with graph neural networks; the cell-line graph is further divided into multiple subgraphs with domain knowledge on biological pathways. A type-aware transformer in DRPreter helps detect relationships between pathways and a drug, highlighting important pathways that are involved in the drug response. Extensive experiments on the GDSC (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity and Cancer) dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based models for drug response prediction. In addition, DRPreter detected putative key genes and pathways for specific drug-cell-line pairs with supporting evidence in the literature, implying that our model can help interpret the mechanism of action of the drug.
