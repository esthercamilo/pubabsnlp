User Experiences of Pharmacogenomic Testing and Opinions among Psychiatry Patients.
Pharmacogenomic testing (PGx) is a tool used to guide physicians in selecting an optimal medication for clients based on their genetic profile. The objective of this qualitative study is to understand patients' experiences with PGx testing as well as their opinions regarding the clinical adoption of such tests in psychiatry. A focus group was conducted to assess the needs of clients who had experience using a PGx test. Participants were recruited from a large study on PGx testing that offered physicians an opportunity to use PGx reports to guide psychotropic prescriptions. The focus group discussions were recorded, transcribed, and coded using NVivo to identify core themes. A total of 11 people participated in the focus group. Our analysis revealed that many participants were in favour of implementing PGx testing in psychiatric practice, and all expressed important considerations for patient-centred optimization of PGx testing. The main themes captured were: education and awareness among clinicians, cost considerations, PGx results-sharing and accessibility, and prospective benefits. The results of this study suggest that patients are keen to see PGx testing in widespread clinical care, but they report important opportunities to improve knowledge mobilization of PGx testing.
