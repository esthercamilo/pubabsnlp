Variability in Human In Vitro Enzyme Kinetics.
There are many factors which are known to cause variability in human in vitro enzyme kinetic data. Factors such as the source of enzyme and how it was prepared, the genetics and background of the donor, how the in vitro studies are designed, and how the data are analyzed contribute to variability in the resulting kinetic parameters. It is important to consider not only the factors which cause variability within an experiment, such as selection of a probe substrate, but also those that cause variability when comparing kinetic data across studies and laboratories. For example, the artificial nature of the microsomal lipid membrane and microenvironment in some recombinantly expressed enzymes, relative to those found in native tissue microsomes, has been shown to influence enzyme activity and thus can be a source of variability when comparing across the two different systems. All of these factors, and several others, are discussed in detail in the chapter below. In addition, approaches which can be used to visualize the uncertainty arising from the use of enzyme kinetic data within the context of predicting human pharmacokinetics are discussed.
