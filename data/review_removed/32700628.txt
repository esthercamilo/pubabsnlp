Genetic variation in Charcot-Marie-Tooth genes contributes to sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.
<b>Aim:</b> This study explored whether inherited variants in genes causing the hereditary neuropathy condition Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are associated with sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN). <b>Patients & methods:</b> Hereditary neuropathy genes previously associated with risk of paclitaxel-induced PN were sequenced in paclitaxel-treated patients. Eight putative genetic predictors in five hereditary neuropathy genes (<i>ARHGEF10</i>, <i>SBF2</i>, <i>FGD4</i>, <i>FZD3</i> and <i>NXN</i>) were tested for association with PN sensitivity after accounting for systemic exposure and clinical variables. <b>Results:</b><i>FZD3</i> rs7833751, a proxy for rs7001034, decreased PN sensitivity (additive model, β = -0.41; 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.17; p = 0.0011). None of the other genetic predictors were associated with PN sensitivity. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results support prior evidence that <i>FZD3</i> rs7001034 is protective of PN and may be useful for individualizing paclitaxel treatment to prevent PN.
