Cytokine signal suppressor (SOCS) 1-1478 CA/del gene polymorphism in Turkish patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.
Eighty-four subjects, premenopausal female patients (n = 42, mean (SD) age: 26.4 (4.2) years) diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 42, mean (SD) age: 27.6(3.4) years), were included in this study. Data on physical examination, anthropometric measurements and blood biochemistry analysis were recorded for each subject along with analysis for SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The relation of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism to PCOS status and insulin resistance was analysed via logistic regression analysis. Mean (SD) levels for BMI (28.5(6.5) vs.22.5 (4.9) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p < .001), HOMA-IR (3.1(1.8) vs.1.5 (1.0), p < .001), LDL-cholesterol (115.9(32.7) vs.100.7 (27.3)mg/dL, p = .03) and triglyceride (113.8(64.9) vs.83.3(36.3)mg/dL, p = .017) were significantly higher in patients. Groups were similar in terms of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism. No significant relation of this polymorphism was noted to PCOS and HOMA-IR. Our findings revealed no difference between groups in terms of the rate of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism, and no significant relation of this polymorphism to insulin resistance and PCOS status. Impact statement Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common cause of anovulation and the most commonly encountered form of female endocrine disease. SOCS proteins have been suggested to play a fundamental role in the negative feedback regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway, which is the major signalling pathway involved in a wide range of physiologic and pathologic processes, including inflammatory diseases, malignancies and immune disorders. Pathways involving the induction of suppression of SOCS proteins were also shown likely to be involved in mediating cytokine-induced insulin resistance. The present study was designed to determine the frequency of SOCS1-1478 CA/del gene polymorphism in patients with PCOS in relation to healthy controls and insulin resistance. Our findings revealed significantly higher rates of insulin resistance, obesity and dyslipidaemia in Turkish patients with PCOS compared with age-matched healthy controls, while no difference between study groups in terms of the rate of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism along with no significant relation of SOCS1-1478 CA/del polymorphism to insulin resistance and PCOS status. Future larger scale studies with the application of standardised diagnostic methods and criteria, and of state-of-the-art modern techniques including genomics, proteomics and pharmacogenetics would provide better understanding of the association between PCOS and genomic variants.
