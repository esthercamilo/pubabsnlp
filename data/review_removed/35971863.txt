<i>ARG2</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs3742879 affects plasma arginase 2 levels, nitric oxide formation and antihypertensive therapy response in preeclampsia.
<b>Aim:</b> This work examined whether <i>ARG1</i> (rs2781659, rs2781667, rs2246012 and rs17599586) and <i>ARG2</i> (rs3742879 and rs10483801) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with antihypertensive therapy responsiveness in preeclampsia (PE) and their effects on arginase isoforms and nitrite concentrations in responsive and nonresponsive patients. <b>Methods:</b> SNP genotypes were determined by TaqMan assays. Plasma arginase levels were measured by ELISA and nitrite concentrations were measured using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay. <b>Results:</b> The G allele for <i>ARG2</i> rs3742879 (A>G) was less frequent in nonresponsive compared with responsive patients (15.5% vs 24.7%, respectively) and the G carriers of the nonresponsive subgroup had lower arginase 2 (9.2 ± 7.5 ng/ml vs 19.1 ± 17.3 ng/ml) and higher nitrite concentrations (110.2 ± 52.8 nM vs 78.5 ± 37.9 nM) than carriers of the AA genotype (all p < 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> <i>ARG2</i> SNP rs3742879 is associated with diminished arginase 2 levels and increased nitric oxide formation in nonresponsive PE patients.
