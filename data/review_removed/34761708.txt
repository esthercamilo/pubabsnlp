Case report of sacituzumab govitecan-hziy-induced neutropenia in a patient with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer and a uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 poor metabolizer genotype.
Sacituzumab govitecan-hziy, approved in 2020 for treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, provides a new option for a population with a historically poor prognosis with standard chemotherapy. Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 poor metabolizers are at increased risk for profound neutropenia. This case discusses clinical implications of the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1*28/*28 genotype in patients receiving sacituzumab govitecan-hziy.
