The pharmacogenetics of tacrolimus in renal transplant patients: association with tremors, new-onset diabetes and other clinical events.
Our study is the first study to investigate the effect of SNPs in CYP3A5, CYP3A4, ABCB1 and POR genes on the incidence of tremors, nephrotoxicity, and diabetes mellitus. A total of 223 renal transplant patients receiving tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were recruited. Both adults and children patients participated in the study. Genotyping was performed using PROFLEX-PCR followed by RFLP. MPA and tacrolimus plasma concentrations were measured by immunoassay. The AUC0-12h of MMF was estimated by a Bayesian method. We found a statistically significant association between the CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A4*1B genotypes and the tacrolimus exposure. We found a lower occurrence of nephrotoxicity (p = 0.03), tremor (p = 0.01), and new-onset diabetes (p = 0.002) associated with CYP3A5*1 allele. The CYP3A4*1B allele was significantly associated with a lower occurrence of new-onset diabetes (p = 0.026). The CYP3A5*1 allele was significantly associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic rejection (p = 0.03 and p < 0.001, respectively). Our results support the usefulness of tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in pre-kidney transplant assessments.
