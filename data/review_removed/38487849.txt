PANCDR: precise medicine prediction using an adversarial network for cancer drug response.
Pharmacogenomics aims to provide personalized therapy to patients based on their genetic variability. However, accurate prediction of cancer drug response (CDR) is challenging due to genetic heterogeneity. Since clinical data are limited, most studies predicting drug response use preclinical data to train models. However, such models might not be generalizable to external clinical data due to differences between the preclinical and clinical datasets. In this study, a Precision Medicine Prediction using an Adversarial Network for Cancer Drug Response (PANCDR) model is proposed. PANCDR consists of two sub-models, an adversarial model and a CDR prediction model. The adversarial model reduces the gap between the preclinical and clinical datasets, while the CDR prediction model extracts features and predicts responses. PANCDR was trained using both preclinical data and unlabeled clinical data. Subsequently, it was tested on external clinical data, including The Cancer Genome Atlas and brain tumor patients. PANCDR outperformed other machine learning models in predicting external test data. Our results demonstrate the robustness of PANCDR and its potential in precision medicine by recommending patient-specific drug candidates.
