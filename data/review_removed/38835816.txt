The potential influence of estrogen-containing oral contraception on clozapine metabolism in a patient with known pharmacogenomic status.
Clozapine is primarily metabolized via cytochrome P450(CYP)1A2 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Metabolic inhibitors of clozapine, such as fluvoxamine and ciprofloxacin, are important to recognize to avoid adverse drug events. Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives (eOCPs) are weaker CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 inhibitors but are associated with a 2-fold increase of clozapine concentrations. The potential for phenoconversion due to a CYP genetic polymorphism can add additional complexities when considering drug interactions. A case report is presented of a suspected interaction between newly initiated clozapine and a prescribed eOCP for which the patient's pharmacogenomic status was known. A 17-year-old, nonsmoking, White female with a history of schizophrenia was initiated on clozapine 12.5 mg at bedtime with a plan to increase by 25 mg every 4 days in the outpatient setting. The patient was a known rapid CYP1A2 metabolizer without identified sources of CYP1A2 induction and a CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer. Based on pharmacogenomic testing, there was no suspicion for significant gene-drug interactions. Yet, as the patient was prescribed an eOCP, a clozapine concentration was obtained after reaching 150 mg at bedtime. This steady-state clozapine concentration was found to be 560 ng/mL, correlating with worsening sedation and constipation. Given ongoing side effects, clozapine was lowered to 100 mg at bedtime; however, ongoing intolerance ultimately led to clozapine discontinuation. This case highlights the potential interaction between clozapine and eOCP in a CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer, leading to clozapine intolerance and discontinuation. The concomitant use of clozapine and eOCPs should be undertaken judiciously.
