Evaluating the frequency and the impact of pharmacogenetic alleles in an ancestrally diverse Biobank population.
Pharmacogenomics (PGx) aims to utilize a patient's genetic data to enable safer and more effective prescribing of medications. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) provides guidelines with strong evidence for 24 genes that affect 72 medications. Despite strong evidence linking PGx alleles to drug response, there is a large gap in the implementation and return of actionable pharmacogenetic findings to patients in standard clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated opportunities for genetically guided medication prescribing in a diverse health system and determined the frequencies of actionable PGx alleles in an ancestrally diverse biobank population.
