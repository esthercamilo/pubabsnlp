Tracheal Aspirate as an Alternative Biologic Sample for Pharmacogenomics Testing in Mechanically Ventilated Pediatric Patients.
Patients in the pediatric intensive care unit are exposed to multiple medications and are at high risk for adverse drug reactions. Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing could help decrease their risk of adverse reactions. Although whole blood is preferred for PGx testing, blood volume in this population is often limited. However, for patients on mechanical ventilation, tracheal secretions are abundant, frequently suctioned, and discarded. Thus, the aim of this pilot study was to determine if tracheal aspirates could be used as a source of human genomic DNA for PGx testing. We successfully extracted DNA from tracheal secretions of all 23 patients in the study. The samples were successfully genotyped for 10 clinically actionable single nucleotide variants across 3 cytochrome P450 genes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A5). Using DNA from whole blood samples in 11 of the patients, we confirmed the accuracy of the genotyping with 100% concordance. Therefore, our results support the use of tracheal aspirates from mechanically ventilated children as an adequate biospecimen for clinical genetic testing.
